The purpose of this study was to \nsystematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering \nthe high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed \non April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and present-\ning data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by \nrandom-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were \nclassified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers \nwere classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking \nprevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0–3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6–14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current \nsmoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9–8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence \nin China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI \n5.7–8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 \nin China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smok-\ning as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory \neffects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.\nKeywords  SARS-CoV-2 · COVID-19 · ACE2 · Inflammation · Smoking · Nicotine · Hospitalization\nIntroduction\nThere is a lot of speculation about the effects of smoking \non Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Media reports \nsuggest that it may increase the risk of being infected with \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), \nthe virus responsible for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is known \nto use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a \nreceptor for cell entry [1]. There is a complex and unclear \ninterplay between COVID-19 and the renin–angioten-\nsin–aldosterone system [2]. Until recently, smoking and \nnicotine were found to down-regulate ACE2 expression in \nthe lung and other tissues [3, 4]. In the last few weeks, stud-\nies suggest that up-regulation of ACE-2 caused by smok-\ning could be detrimental for COVID-19 [5–7]. However, \nit seems that up-regulation of ACE2 may in fact be protec-\ntive against disease severity [2]. Experimental data suggest \nthat infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 leads to \ndown-regulation of ACE2, and this could be detrimental due \nto uncontrolled ACE and angiotensin II activity, leading to \ninflammation, and organ damage [1, 8]. It has been observed \nthat decreased ACE2 availability contributes to lung injury \nand ARDS development [9–11]. Therefore, up-regulation of \nACE2 does not necessarily imply increased susceptibility or \ndisease severity and in fact could be beneficial.\nAccording to the 2018 Global Adult Tobacco Survey, \nChina has a high prevalence of smoking (26.6%), much \n *\t Konstantinos Farsalinos \n\t\nkfarsalinos@gmail.com\n1\t\nDepartment of Public and Community Health, School \nof Public Health, University of West Attica, Leoforos \nAlexandras 196A, 11521 Athens, Greece\n2\t\nDepartments of Social and Behavioral Science \nand Epidemiology, College of Global Public Health, New \nYork University, New York, USA\n846\n\t\nInternal and Emergency Medicine (2020) 15:845–852\n1 3\nhigher among males (50.5%) than females (2.1%) [12]. Thus, \nit is expected that a high prevalence of current smoking \nwould be observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients \nin China. However, it was recently suggested that there is no \nstrong evidence for a link between smoking and COVID-19 \ndue to the low prevalence of smoking among COVID-19 \npatients in 2 studies [13]. The purpose of this study was to \nsystematically examine the prevalence of current smoking \namong all published case series of hospitalized patients with \nCOVID-19 in China, and compare it with the population \nprevalence of current smoking.\nMethods\nA literature search was conducted on PubMed, using the \nterms “(SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19 OR 2019-nCoV) AND \nClinical” in the title or the abstract on April 1. Out of a total \nof 432 studies, 13 studies which included data about the \nsmoking status were identified [14–26]. The pooled preva-\nlence of current smoking from all studies was calculated \nby random-effects meta-analysis using JASP Version 0.11.1 \n(JASP Team 2019, University of Amsterdam, The Nether-\nlands). To address the possibility that some smoker had quit \nshortly before hospitalization and were classified as former \nsmokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a sec-\nondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified \nas current smokers. Additionally, because two studies were \nperformed from the same group of researchers (China Medi-\ncal Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19) and could involve \noverlap of patients [14, 15], we performed an additional \nanalysis by removing the study with the lower prevalence \nof current smoking from the caclulations [14].\nResults\nThe studies analyzed are presented in Table 1. A total of \n5960 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from China were \npresented in all studies. The majority (55.1%) were males. \nThe mean or median age ranged from 38 to 68 years, with \nsome studies presenting mean age in different subgroups. \nOne study presented patients divided into two subgroups \naccording to age (< 60 years and ≥ 60 years) [16] while \nanother one reported cases according to the presence or \nabsence of gastrointestinal symptoms. [17] In both studies, \nthe 2 subgroups were combined and treated as one sample. \nTwo studies reported the smoking status as \"history of smok-\ning\" or “smoking”. [23, 25] Although it was unclear if this \nincluded both current and former smokers, we analyzed the \nTable 1   Gender and smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China\nIn Ling et al., data on sex was presented for 1578 patients.

In most stud-\nies, former smokers were not reported (Table 1).\nThe current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4 to \n12.6%. The random effects pooled prevalence of current \nsmoking was 6.5% (95% CI 4.9–8.2%). Findings from \nthe random-effects meta-analysis are presented in Fig. 1. \nThe observed outcome is the estimated prevalence of \ncurrent smoking among those who were hospitalized \nwith COVID-19. The forest plot depicts the fractional \nprevalence of smokers in each study. The size of the dark \nsquares is proportional to the weight each study has in \ndetermining the combined effect size estimate. The com-\nbined effect estimate is depicted via the dark diamond \n(RE Model), with the 95% confidence interval corre-\nsponding to the width of the diamond. The meta-anal-\nysis also indicated statistically significant heterogeneity \nbetween studies (p < 0.001).\nOnly three studies reported the prevalence of former \nsmoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients [13, 16, \n19]. When considering these patients as current smok-\ners, the pooled estimate of smoking prevalence was 7.3% \n(95% CI 5.7–8.9%).\nBy removing the study by Liang et al. [14] due to \npotential overlap with patients presented in the Ni et al. \nstudy, [15] the pooled estimate of smoking prevalence \nwas 6.5% (95% CI 4.5–8.4%).\nDiscussion\nThis study calculated for the first time the prevalence of \ncurrent smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-\n19 in China. The estimated prevalence of current smoking \nwas unexpectedly low, approximately 1/4th the most recently \nestimated population smoking prevalence in China.\nThis preliminary analysis, assuming that the reported \ndata are accurate, suggests that current smoking does not \nappear to be a predisposing factor for hospitalization for \nCOVID-19. However, there are limitations that cannot be \naddressed with currently available evidence and data. Con-\nfounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, should be \nconsidered in examining if access of Chinese smokers with \nCOVID-19 to hospital care may be different as compared \nto the non-smoking population. While the pooled preva-\nlence of smoking was not adjusted for gender, gender dis-\ntribution of the patients included in the studies was similar \nto population estimates (51.1% males). [27] At this time, it \nis impossible to perform a multivariate analysis or exam-\nine the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization according \nto the smoking status in a population-representative sam-\nple. The consistency and accuracy of the recorded smok-\ning status are also unknown. Considering the emergency \nof the epidemic, it is possible that the smoking status of \npatients was not accurately recorded or some patients were \nunable to report their smoking status. It is also possible \nFig. 1   Random effects pooled \nprevalence of current smoking \nobserved from 13 studies of \nhospitalized COVID-19 patients \nin China.

One study reported that the group \nof never smokers included patients with unknown smok-\ning status, but the authors did not report the number of \npatients with unknown smoking status. [14] One study \nmentioned that “few patients had a current or former ciga-\nrette smoking history of at least 30 pack years”, but it was \nunclear if only patients with 30 pack years or more were \npresented in the study table [19]. At the same time, two \nstudies may have included former smokers into the groups \nreferred to as “smoking” or “smoking history” [23, 25]. In \nany case, the large difference between smoking prevalence \namong patients and population smoking prevalence is dif-\nficult to be fully explained by missing data on the smoking \nstatus. The smoking status was not objectively assessed, \nbut this is common and expected practice in case series \nof hospitalized patients. Another possibility is that some \npatients may have quit smoking shortly after disease initia-\ntion and before admission to hospital; these patients would \nbe registered as former smokers. However, the secondary \nanalysis, which classified former smokers as current smok-\ners, also found a low pooled smoking prevalence. While \nonly 3 out of the 13 studies reported former smoking and \n2 studies reported smoking without clarifying if they were \ncurrent or former smokers, a study by Lui et al. found that \nonly 8.4% of males and 0.8% of females in China were for-\nmer smokers [28]. Consider the low prevalence of former \nsmoking in the Chinese population, it is possible that none \nof the patients were former smokers in some of the studies. \nAnother limitation is that differences in population smok-\ning prevalence may exist between age groups, considering \nthat age is a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19 and \nhospitalization would be more likely for older people. A \nstudy by Liu et al. reported that the highest smoking preva-\nlence in China was observed in males aged 40–59 years \n[28]. The median age in all the studies analyzed herein \nwas < 59 years. Additionally, high smoking prevalence was \nobserved among older Chinese males by Liu et al. Spe-\ncifically, the prevalence of current smoking in males was: \n46.5% in 18–29 years, 57.6% in 30–39 years, 60.3% in \n40–49 years, 59.5% in 50–59 years, 52.2% in 60–69 years \nand 41.5% in 70+ years. In females, the highest smok-\ning rates were observed in those aged 50 years or higher \n(4.7–8.7%) compared to younger age groups (1.7–2.6%) \n[28]. Moreover, the 2018 GATS reported that prevalence \nof current smoking was 57.7% and 2.7% in males and \nfemales, respectively, in age groups 45–64 years, and \n44% and 4.1%, respectively, in age group ≥ 65 years [12]. \nThus, it is unlikely that age was a factor that substantially \naffected the present analysis. In any case, the calculated \npooled prevalence of current smoking was approximately \n1/4th the population smoking prevalence in China. Such \na difference could only be explained by massive under-\nreporting of current smoking.\nThe study may also have implications when examin-\ning the effect of smoking status on disease progression, \ncomplications and death among hospitalized COVID-19 \npatients. Two recent studies performed univariate analyses \nand found an association between smoking and adverse out-\ncome among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, although it \nwas not always statistically significant [29, 30]. Smokers are \nmore likely than non-smokers to suffer from comorbidities, \nsuch as cardiovascular disease, which appear to be impli-\ncated in COVID-19 mortality. Thus, it is possible that at \nleast some of the smokers hospitalized for COVID-19 may \nhave suffered from comorbidities that adversely affected \ndisease severity. In fact, due to the higher prevalence of \nthese comorbidities among current smokers, it would have \nbeen expected for smokers to be over-represented among \nhospitalized COVID-19 cases as compared to the general \npopulation; however, the reverse is true. The recent evidence \nfrom the US CDC is in agreement with the data from Chi-\nnese studies. [31] From a total of 7162 patients in the US, \nonly 1.3% were current smokers. Low smoking prevalence \nwas also observed among hospitalized non-ICU (2.1%) and \nICU cases (1.1%), while the population smoking preva-\nlence in the US is 13.8%. Additionally, a small case series \nfrom Germany presented 50 COVID-19 patients of whom \nonly 3 (6.0%) were current smokers. [32] It is possible that \nthe risk for hospitalization for COVID-19 may be differ-\nent for otherwise healthy smokers as compared to smokers \nwith smoking-related disease. This is an important reason \nfor not recommending smoking as a measure to reduce risk \nfor severe COVID-19. The well-established elevated risk \nfor cancer, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease due to \nsmoking would not make it an appropriate and sustainable \nprotective measure.\nAlthough no firm conclusion can currently be made con-\ncerning the specific effects of smoking on the risk of hospi-\ntalization for COVID-19, tobacco cigarette smoke contains \nseveral toxins and other chemicals that are not known to \nhave any potentially protective effects against COVID-19 \nthrough immunomodulatory or antiviral properties. How-\never, one of the main components of tobacco cigarette smoke \nis nicotine. Nicotine has been found to prevent acute lung \ninjury in an animal Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome \n(ARDS) model and to inhibit TNF expression in airway \nepithelial cells in vitro [33, 34]. It has also exhibited anti-\ninflammatory properties in vivo in humans exposed to \nendotoxins [35]. Nicotine is an agonist of the cholinergic \nanti-inflammatory pathway that regulates host immune and \ninflammatory responses [36–39]. It inhibits the production \nof pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1, and \nIL-6, without inhibiting the production of anti-inflammatory \n849\nInternal and Emergency Medicine (2020) 15:845–852\t\n1 3\ncytokines, such as IL-10 [36, 40–42]. Such an effect has \nbeen found to protect against cytokine-mediated diseases, \nsuch as sepsis and endotoxemia, which lead to organ dam-\nage and death. “Cytokine Release Syndrome” (also known \nas “cytokine storm”) is a phenomenon characterized by an \nincreased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may \noccur in response to infections and can progress to ARDS. \nThis phenomenon seems to be important in the pathophysiol-\nogy of severe COVID-19 and could explain the postmortem \nhistopathological findings in a COVID-19 paitent [43–46]. \nSARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune system and the \naccompanying release of a large number of cytokines, \nincluding IL-6, which can increase vascular permeability, \ncause migration of fluid and blood cells into the alveoli and \nresult in dyspnea and respiratory failure [44]. IL-6 was a \npredictor of mortality in a case series of 160 COVID-19 \npatients [47] and it was elevated in non-survivors as com-\npared to survivors in another study of 191 patients [19]. As \na result, the use of medications targeting pro-inflammatory \ncytokines, such as IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors, has been recom-\nmended and is already being tested in clinical trials, in an \neffort to treat patients with severe COVID-19 by neutralizing \nthese key inflammatory mediators [43, 44, 47, 48]. The US \nFDA recently approved a phase III clinical trial of an IL-6 \ninhibitor for the treatment of COVID-19 [49]. Other anti-\ninflammatory therapeutic options that have been proposed \nto be tested include anti-TNF medications [50]. Therefore, \nthe cytokine storm is a therapeutic target in clinical trials \nconducted on COVID-19 patients, and nicotine has effects \non the immune system that could be beneficial in reducing \nthe intensity of the cytokine storm.\nConcerning the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis, \nACE2 counteracts the adverse effects of angiotensin II by \ncleaving angiotensin I and angiotensin II to angiotensin \n(1–7). The latter has well-established vasodilatory, anti-\ninflammatory and antioxidant properties. In smokers, the \nrecently-observed ACE2 up-regulation is probably induced \nas a defense mechanism to counteract the effects of angio-\ntensin II. ACE2 has been found to protect mice from devel-\noping ARDS [10, 51]. Tobacco cigarette smoke caused \nenhanced damage to the lungs of ACE2 knockout mice as \ncompared to wild-type mice, providing further support that \nACE2 up-regulation is an important and beneficial defense \nmechanism [52]. Data from SARS experimental studies sug-\ngest that continuous SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication \ninduces down-regulation of ACE2 which may be implicated \nin organ damage and disease severity [2]. Thus, up-regula-\ntion of ACE2, though seemingly paradoxical, may in fact \nprotect patients from severe disease and lung injury [11]. \nCurrently, there is no evidence to suggest that up-regulation \nof ACE2 is associated with increased COVID-19 suscep-\ntibility or severity. In fact, estrogens appear to up-regulate \nACE2 while children and younger adults have higher ACE2 \nlevels as compared to older people, which could explain the \nmilder COVID-19 in women and younger people and sug-\ngest a protective effect [53, 54]. Moreover, the contradic-\ntory findings about smoking in the literature, with studies \npublished before the COVID-19 pandemic reporting that \nsmoking and nicotine down-regulate ACE2 [3, 4] and other \nstudies published during the pandemic reporting that they \nup-regulate ACE2 [5–7], do not allow for solid conclusions \nregarding the effects of nicotine or smoking on ACE2. These \nfindings may also represent an indication of the dynamic \nbalance between ACE and ACE2, which may be continu-\nously changing depending on stressors and stimuli. Thus, \nthere is uncertainty on whether nicotine affects COVID-19 \nprogression through the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis.\nThe potential benefits of nicotine through its immu-\nnomodulatory effects and complex interactions with the \nrenin–angiotensin system suggested with this hypothesis \ncould explain, at least in part, the increased severity or \nadverse outcome among smokers hospitalized for COVID-\n19 since these patients inevitably experience abrupt cessa-\ntion of nicotine intake during hospitalization. Comorbidi-\nties that are associated with smoking, such as cardiovascular \ndiseases and COPD, also represent risk factors for adverse \noutcome in COVID-19. Therefore, the presence of these \ncomorbidities would confound the clear interpretation of \nnicotine effects.\nIt is important to emphasize that the present analysis \nexamined only hospitalized cases. Thus, no conclusion can \nbe drawn about the prevalence of current smoking among \npatients with less severe COVID-19 that would not require \nhospitalization. Nicotine is unlikely to have direct antiviral \nproperties, thus it is not expected to act as chemoprophy-\nlaxis. Therefore, it is unlikely that nicotine could prevent \ninfection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the above-mentioned \nhypothesis is relevant to experiencing a milder form of \nCOVID-19, reducing the risk for being hospitalized.\nIn conclusion, the observations of a consistently low \nprevalence of smoking among COVID-19 cases in China \nand the US, together with the potential mechanisms through \nwhich nicotine interacts with the inflammatory process and \nthe renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis, warrant an investi-\ngation of the clinical effects of pharmaceutical nicotine on \nCOVID-19 susceptibility, progression, and severity through \nclinical trials. This may be feasible through repurposing \nalready approved (for other indications) pharmaceutical \nnicotine products such as nicotine patches, or even by using \nthese products as already indicated (i.e. as smoking sub-\nstitutes). These products are relatively safe and have been \nadministered therapeutically in non-smokers for neurologi-\ncal conditions and inflammatory bowel disease for longer \nperiods than would be needed for COVID-19 [55–57]. Nico-\ntine could also be administered though inhalation, with the \nuse of a nebulizer or other aerosol systems, if needed, for \n850\n\t\nInternal and Emergency Medicine (2020) 15:845–852\n1 3\nan added local effect [58]. Additionally, nicotine adminis-\ntration would not substitute for other treatment regimens \nand could be added to antiviral or other therapeutic options \nfor COVID-19. The potential need to provide pharmaceuti-\ncal nicotine products to smokers and users of other nicotine \nproducts who experience an abrupt cessation of nicotine \nintake when hospitalized for COVID-19 or aim to follow \nmedical advice to quit smoking should also be examined. \nIn that case, the use of pharmaceutical nicotine products \nwould represent an “on-label” use since they would be used \nbased on their official indication (as smoking substitutes). \nIn fact, the Addiction Prevention Network in France (RES-\nPADD) officially recommends the use of nicotine replace-\nment therapies for smokers when hospitalized for any illness \n[59]. Finally, our findings could have implications for users \nof other nicotine products, such as electronic cigarettes or \nsnus, who may also experience nicotine withdrawal if hos-\npitalized. No studies recording electronic cigarette or snus \nuse or among COVID-19 have been published until now.\nAuthor contributions  KF conceived the study. KF, AB, and RN \nperformed the analysis.

This study aimed to \ninvestigate the effect of smoking status (current smoking and a smoking history) on the clinical severity of COVID-19. Data of all \nenrolled 588 patients, who were referred to 25 hospitals in Jiangsu province between January 10, 2020 and March 14, 2020, \nwere retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate regression, random forest algorithms, and additive interaction were \nused to estimate the importance of selective predictor variables in the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity. In the \nunivariate analysis, the proportion of patients with a current smoking status in the severe group was significantly higher than that \nin the non-severe group. In the multivariate analysis, current smoking remained a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Data from the \ninteraction analysis showed a strong interaction between the number of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 and smoking. \nHowever, no significant interaction was found between smoking and specific comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. \nIn the random forest model, smoking history was ranked sixth in mean decrease accuracy. Active smoking may be significantly \nassociated with an enhanced risk of COVID-19 progression towards severe disease. However, additional prospective studies are \nneeded to clarify the complex relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity.\nAbbreviations: ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, COVID-19 = coronavirus \ndisease 2019, CRP = C-reactive protein, ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IQR = interquartile range, MDA = mean decrease \naccuracy, MDG = mean decrease Gini, SaO2 = finger pulse oxygen saturation, SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus 2.\nKeywords: coronavirus disease 2019, disease severity, nicotine, random forest, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \n2, smoking\n1. Introduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was \ndeclared a global public health emergency by the World Health \nOrganization in January, 2020.[1] Whole genome sequencing \nand pathogenic nucleic acid analysis confirmed that the virus \nwas the seventh member of the coronavirus family that can \ninfect humans.[2] As of March 2021, the number of persons \nwith COVID-19 worldwide was approximately 115 million, \nwith more than 2.5 million deaths.[3] COVID-19 has several \nclinical manifestations. The main presenting symptoms are \nfever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum pro-\nduction, and shortness of breath. Some patients present with \nYH, YH, and QH contributed equally to this work.\nThis research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 81672218, and the Department of Science, Education, and Health Program of \nJiangsu Province, grant number QNRC 2016606 and QNRC 2016604.\nInformed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\nThe datasets generated and analysed in this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nThe study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing \nMedical University.\naDepartment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China, bDepartment of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of \nNanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China, cDepartment of Biostatistics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.\n*Correspondence: Yuan Liu & Jun Hu, Department of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China (e-mail: \nliuyuan781115@163.com).\nCopyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Some patients \nwith severe disease may present with acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, and even \ndeath.[4]\nSARS-CoV-2 is a β coronavirus, which is 88% identical to \ntwo bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-\nlike coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, \nat the whole genome level. However, the S receptor-binding \ndomain structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-\nCoV, despite the amino acid variation at some key residue \npoints.[5] The receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is angio-\ntensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).[6] They invade cells through \nendosomal or non-endosomal pathways with the help of differ-\nent host cell proteases, which have a structural basis for direct \ninjury of extrapulmonary organs or tissues. Because of the cell \nspecificity of ACE2 and host cell protease, the affinity of SARS-\nCoV-2 to different organs varies.[7,8]\nSmoking seriously damages human health and is the main \nrisk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.[9] ACE \nand ACE2 are important components of the renin-angioten-\nsin system. ACE is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of \nangiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II, which exerts a strong vasocon-\nstrictive effect. Ang II favours vasoconstriction, cellular prolifer-\nation, inflammation, and fibrilization when it binds to the Ang \nII Type 1 receptor. Previous studies have suggested that long-\nterm smoking changes renin-angiotensin system homeostasis by \nup-regulating the detrimental ACE/Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor \naxis and down-regulating the compensatory ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/\nMas receptor axis, thus favouring the development of cardio-\npulmonary diseases.[9,10] Thus, it would be expected that a large \nproportion of patients with COVID-19 are smokers. Chakladar \net al found that smoking-mediated upregulation of the andro-\ngen pathway leads to increased SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.[11] \nUmnuaypornlert et al conducted a meta-analysis and found that \nsmoking, whether current smoking or former smoking, signifi-\ncantly increases the risk of COVID-19 severity and death.[12]\nIn contrast, a systematic review and meta-analyses found an \nunexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hos-\npitalised patients with COVID-19.[13,14] A low prevalence of \ncurrent smokers among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 \nhas been reported in several studies.[15,16] However, the relation-\nship between smoking and COVID-19 severity remains unclear. \nTo address this important clinical question, this study aimed \nto evaluate the effect of smoking status (current smoking and \nformer smoking) on the clinical severity of COVID-19, which \nmay provide additional evidence for active and effective inter-\nventions and treatment measures for early-disease stages and for \nreducing the mortality rate of patients with severe disease.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study design and participants\nA total of 588 patients were referred to 25 hospitals in Jiangsu \nprovince between January 10, 2020 and March 14, 2020; they \nwere enrolled, and their data were retrospectively and con-\nsecutively analysed. According to the government's arrange-\nments, all tertiary hospitals provide treatment for patients with \nCOVID-19, diagnosed using the World Health Organization \ninterim guidance[17,18] and the guidelines of COVID-19 diag-\nnosis and treatment trial (5th edition) of the National Health \nCommission of the People's Republic of China.[18,19] This study \nwas performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and \nwas approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated \nHospital of Nanjing Medical University. Written informed con-\nsent was obtained from participants or their families for data \ncollection. Based on disease severity, the patients were divided \ninto four groups: mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill. \nThe criteria for this clinical classification can be found in previ-\nous studies.[20,21]\n2.2. Data collection and study definitions\nThe variables of interest included (1) participants’ general \ninformation: age, sex, smoking history, comorbidities (such as \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hepatitis B, \ncancer, chronic kidney disease, and immunodeficiency disease), \ntherapeutic drugs, respiratory support, and disease outcome; (2) \npatients’ main clinical symptoms and signs; (3) results of labo-\nratory tests performed within 48 hours of admission to the hos-\npital or intensive care unit: blood routine examination, level of \nC-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, \naspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, \ntotal bilirubin, creatine kinase, creatinine, D-dimer, erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate (ESR), and finger pulse oxygen saturation \n(SaO2); and (4) imaging findings such as chest computed tomog-\nraphy findings. Data were obtained from the electronic medi-\ncal records and initially evaluated by trained physicians. Full \nrecovery and discharge, disease regression from critical/severe to \nnon-severe disease status, positive to negative polymerase chain \nreaction, and maintenance of non-severe status were considered \nas disease improvement or favourable clinical outcome.\n2.3. Smoking history\nSmoking was quantified as pack-years (number of cigarettes \nsmoked per day multiplied by the number of years of smoking). \nFor example, smoking one pack a day for 10 years was defined \nas 10 pack-years. Any patient with a smoking quantity above 10 \npack-years was considered as having a significant smoking his-\ntory. Based on the patients’ smoking history, the study popula-\ntion was divided into two groups: the ≥10 pack-years group (16 \npatients), which included patients whose current smoking was \n≥10 pack-years, and the <10 pack-years group (572 patients), \nwhich included non-smokers, former smokers, and patients \nwhose current smoking was <10 pack-years.\n2.4. Statistical analysis\nContinuous variables are expressed as medians and interquar-\ntile ranges or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical vari-\nables are summarised as counts and percentages. For continuous \nvariables, the Student t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used \nfor data analysis, while the chi-square test or Fisher exact test \nwas used to analyse categorical variables. No imputation was \nmade for missing data. All the statistics in this study are descrip-\ntive because the patient cohort was not derived from random \nselection. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were cal-\nculated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression \nmodels. The random Forest package in R software was used \nto perform a random forest classification of the data.[22–24] To \nassess the relationship between independent and dependent \nvariables, COVID-19 severity was considered as the dependent \nvariable and clinical characteristics as the independent vari-\nables. The number of classification trees was set at 1000. Each \ntime, 588 patients were sampled randomly with replacement to \nconstruct the classification tree. In each split, entry was set as \nthe square root of the number of total variables to sample vari-\nables randomly as candidates. The variables were assessed and \nranked by measuring the effect of perturbing them on Mean \nDecrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini (MDG). \nComorbidity–smoking behaviour interaction analysis was per-\nformed using a logistic regression model. All analyses were \nimplemented with R 3.12 software (R Foundation for Statistical \nComputing, Beijing, China; http://www.Rproject.org).[24] Two-\nsided P-values <.05 were considered statistically significant.\n3\nHe et al.  •  Medicine (2022) 101:29\b\nwww.md-journal.com\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics\nAll the 588 patients had positive reverse transcriptase poly-\nmerase chain reaction tests. By the end of the study, all the \npatients had recovered and were discharged. The severe group \nconsisted of 46 patients with severe or critical disease, while the \nnon-severe group consisted of 542 patients with mild or mod-\nerate disease. The demographic and clinical characteristics of \nthe patients in the two groups are shown in Table 1. There was \nno significant difference in sex between the two groups. The \nmedian age of the patients was 46 (range, 33–56) years. Most \nof the patients in the severe group were above 65 years (34.8%, \n16/46), while most of the patients in the non-severe group \nwere within the 15 to 49 years age range (58.9%, 319/542). \nOn admission, cough (87.0%, 40/46) and fever (43.5%, 20/46) \nwere the most common symptoms in the severe group, while \ncough (64.0%, 347/542) and fever (30.8%, 167/542) were the \nmost common in the non-severe group. Hypertension (16.3%, \n96/588) and diabetes (7.8%, 46/588) were the most com-\nmon comorbidities in the overall patient cohort, severe group \n(34.8%, 16/46; 26.1%, 12/46), and non-severe group (14.8%, \n80/542; 6.3%, 34/542).\n3.2. Univariate and multivariate analysis results\nThe univariate analysis showed that there were significant dif-\nferences in age, current smoking status, length of hospital stay, \ncough, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, chest distress, \ninappetence, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cere-\nbrovascular disease, and cancer, SaO2 <95%, white blood cell \ncount >10.0 × 109/L, lymphocyte count <0.8 × 109/L, CRP level \n≥10 mg/L, LDH level ≥250 U/L, AST level >40 U/L, ESR, sodium \nlevel, and CD4+ T cells counts between the two groups (P < .05, \nTable  1). In the multivariate regression analysis, age, current \nsmoking status, length of hospital stay, cough, cerebrovascular \ndisease, SaO2 <95%, and lymphocyte count <0.8 × 109/L were \nrisk factors for severe COVID-19 (P < .05, Table 2). Some fac-\ntors such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, chest dis-\ntress, inappetence, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, \nand cancer, white blood cell count >10.0 × 109/L, CRP level \n≥10 mg/L, LDH level ≥250 U/L, AST level >40 U/L, ESR, sodium \nlevel, and CD4+ T cell counts were not significant factors in the \nmultivariate regression analysis.\n3.3. Relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity\nIn the univariate analysis, the proportion of patients with a \ncurrent smoking status in the severe group (13.0%, 6/46) was \nsignificantly higher than that in the non-severe group (4.4%, \n24/542). Current smoking status remained a risk factor for \nCOVID-19 severity in the multivariate analysis. (P < 05). The \ndifferences in the demographic and clinical characteristics \nbetween the ≥10 pack-years and <10 pack-years group are \nshown in Table 3. There were significant differences in age, sex, \ndiabetes, cerebrovascular disease, median haemoglobin level, \nand CD4+ T cell counts between the two groups.\nEpidemiological studies show an interaction among factors \nwhen the combined effect of more than two risk factors on a \ndisease is different from the sum of their independent effects. \nBiological interaction has attracted much attention due to its \npracticality in biological and clinical settings, as it relies heav-\nily on statistical interactions.[22] The evaluation of statistical \ninteractions is mainly based on multiplicative and additive \ninteractions, with additive interaction having a greater biolog-\nical and public health significance.[23] Through the interaction \nanalysis, we found that only the number of comorbidities had \nan interaction with smoking (P = .043), with estimates of inter-\naction (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval: 0.31–0.95) \nTable 1\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of patients with \nCOVID-19.\n \nSevere cases  \n(n = 46) \nNonsevere cases  \n(n = 542) \nP‡ \nAge\n  \u0007Median (IQR), y\n56.5 (48.0–68.5)\n44.0 (32.0–55.0)\n \n  \u0007Distribution no./total no.

There was no interaction between smoking and \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hepatitis B, can-\ncer, chronic kidney disease, and tuberculosis (P > .05).\nThe random forest algorithm can be used to analyse nonlinear, \ncollinear, and interactive data effectively. As one of the classical \nalgorithms of machine learning, the random forest algorithm \nhas a high accuracy in risk prediction and diagnosis of diseases. \nIt is currently widely used in molecular and genetic fields and \nother medical fields.[24,25] In MDA, the greater the decrease in \nthe accuracy after permutation of the variable, the more import-\nant the predictor is. MDG) is the sum of all decreases in Gini \nimpurity. MDG values show the importance of the variable in \nCOVID-19 severity prediction. The top three important predic-\ntors in the MDA analysis were lymphocyte count, shortness of \nbreath, and age. The top three variables in the MDG analysis \nwere lymphocyte count, age, and SaO2 <95%. Smoking history \nwas ranked sixth in the MDA analysis and twenty second in the \nMDG analysis (Fig. 1).\n4. Discussion\nIn the univariate analysis in this study, the proportion of patients \nwith a current smoking status in the severe group was signifi-\ncantly higher than that in non-severe group. Current smoking \nstatus still remained a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in the \nmultivariate analysis. The interaction analysis showed that there \nwas a strong interaction between the number of comorbidities \nin patients with COVID-19 and smoking. However, there was \nno significant interaction between smoking and specific comor-\nbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. In the random forest \nmodel, smoking history was ranked sixth in MDA.\nThe tobacco industry has created millions of jobs around \nthe world and provided a large amount of tax revenue to \nthe government. Simultaneously, 50% of tobacco consumers \ndie from cigarette smoke, which causes heavy losses to the \nhealthcare system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, smok-\ning and the risk of acute respiratory infections have attracted \na lot of interest again.[26,27] Smith et al demonstrated that \nACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respi-\nratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers an increase in \nthe population of these cells and a concomitant increase in \nACE2 expression. ACE2 expression is responsive to inflam-\nmatory signalling and can be upregulated by viral infections \nor interferon treatment. They suggested that SARS-CoV-2 \ninfections could create positive feedback loops that increase \nACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.[28] These \nmechanisms may partially explain why smokers are particu-\nlarly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Findings \nfrom Leung et al suggested that quitting smoking can reduce \nthe probability of COVID-19 progression to severe disease. \nIn the study, patients who were smokers or who had chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease had higher ACE2 levels, \nincreasing the probability of viral entry into the host cells and \ninfection. They also found that ex-smokers and never-smok-\ners had similar ACE2 levels. These findings support the fact \nthat immediate quitting of smoking is optimal.[29] Arunima \nalso found that smoking causes more severe SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection by blocking the activity of the immune system mes-\nsenger proteins, interferons, at least in part. Interferons play \na crucial role in the body's early immune response, triggering \nTable 2\nMultivariate analysis of risk factors related to the incidence of \nthe severe cases.\nVariable \nOR (95% CI) \nP \nAge\n1.04 (1.01, 1.08)\n.015\nCurrent smoker\n4.28 (1.04, 15.72)\n.033\nLength of hospital stay\n1.07 (1.01, 1.12)\n.015\nCough\n6.18 (2.14, 22.37)\n.002\nShortness of breath\n1.96 (0.57, 6.44)\n.273\nNausea or vomiting\n3.93 (0.91, 14.84)\n.052\nChest distress\n1.23 (0.35, 3.86)\n.730\nInappetence\n1.49 (0.59, 3.59)\n.383\nHypertension\n1.52 (0.56, 3.92)\n.397\nDiabetes\n1.57 (0.50, 4.57)\n.421\nCerebrovascular disease\n7.64 (0.87, 54.08)\n.046\nCancer\n1.22 (0.07, 13.50)\n.882\n[Table_Body]SaO2 \n0.15 (0.04, 0.56)\n.004\nLymphocyte count 9/L\n6.17 (2.67, 14.45)\n[Table_Body]\nC-reactive protein =10 mg/L\n0.81 (0.34, 1.84)\n.621\nAspartate aminotransferase >40 U/L\n2.49 (0.84, 6.74)\n.082\nMedian sodium\n0.70 (0.27, 1.66)\n.431\nCD4+ T cells counts\n1.00 (0.99, 1.00)\n.092\n \nSevere cases  \n(n = 46) \nNonsevere cases  \n(n = 542) \nP‡ \n  \u0007Distribution no./total no.

When COVID-19 gets severe, \nexcessive lung inflammation may occur due to a virus-activated \n“cytokine storm.”. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory path-\nway that modulates the inflammatory response during systemic \ninflammation has been demonstrated. In addition, α7-nicotinic \nacetylcholine receptor is essential in attenuating the inflamma-\ntory response.[32] Nicotine is the main active substance in tobacco. \nIt has been reported that nicotine, an agonist, plays an anti-in-\nflammatory role in mice with acute lung injury.[33] Some studies \nsuggested that nicotine may represent a potential therapeutic \ntarget for the improvement of cytokine storms and attenuation \nof dysregulated inflammatory responses of patients with COVID-\n19.[32,34] Perhaps this complex biological mechanism of nicotine \ncan explain different relationships between smoking and COVID-\n19 severity in epidemiological studies.\nIt is believed that older patients with chronic diseases, such as \ndiabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension are susceptible \nto respiratory failure and may have a poorer outcome.[15,35] In our \nstudy, in the univariate analysis, the proportion of patients with \nhypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, or cancer in the \nsevere group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe \ngroup. Hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and can-\ncer remained risk factors for severe COVID-19 in the multivariate \nanalysis. Interestingly, there were statistically significant differences \nin diabetes and cerebrovascular disease between the patients who \nwere current smokers with a smoking quantity of ≥10 pack-years \nand the other patients. The internal regulatory mechanism of dia-\nbetes, cerebrovascular disease, and smoking needs further research.\nThis study has three main limitations that must be acknowl-\nedged. First, due to the study's retrospective nature and the limited \nnumber of patients, our conclusions need to be further verified in \nprospective studies with large sample sizes. Second, data on prog-\nnosis was unavailable at the time of the analysis, and a longer \nfollow-up time would have provided more detailed information \non the potential risk factors that could interfere with clinical out-\ncomes. Third, the study was focused on patients with obvious \nclinical symptoms who went to the hospital for treatment; thus, \nasymptomatic patients who might have been super-spreaders \nor patients with mild symptoms may have been missed. Fourth, \nsmoking is a behavioural change in a person, and COVID has \ninfected all throughout the world irrespective of their habits. Our \nretrospective analysis may only assume an association between \nsmoking status and risk of severe COVID-19, and not a cause-\nand-effect relation.[36] Considering the descriptive nature of the \ncurrent reports with no control group, and other factors, our find-\nings should be considered as hypothesis-generating indicating the \nneed for further studies.[37] Fifth, patients with lung cancer are \nmore susceptible and more likely to develop more severe COVID-\n19 disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection.[38,39] So further study by \ncollecting more patients with COVID-19 complicated by lung \ncancer to investigate the relationship between lung cancer, smok-\ning and COVID-19 may be required.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the results of this multicentre retrospective observa-\ntional study of Chinese patients suggest that active smoking may \nhave a significant association with a greater risk of COVID-19 \nprogressing towards severe disease. Physicians and public health \nprofessionals should urgently take effective preventive measures to \nTable 4\nCharacteristics of COVID-19 patients–smoking interaction \nanalysis.\nInteraction \nOR (95% CI) \nP \nCoexisting disorder\n  \u0007COPD × Smoking\n1.98 × 10-7 (0, 1.33 × 1049)\n.988\n  \u0007Hypertension × Smoking\n0.34 (6.31 × 10-2, 1.11)\n.114\n  \u0007Diabetes × \n0.75 (0.22, 2.31)\n.615\n  \u0007Cardiovascular disease × Smoking\n2.64 × 10-6 (0, 6.38 × 1034)\n.986\n  \u0007Cerebrovascular disease Smoking\n2.93 × 10-4 (0, 1.18 × 1031)\n.987\n  \u0007Cancer Smoking\n4.94 × 10-4 (0, 4.26 × 1035)\n.986\n  \u0007Chronic renal disease × Smoking\n0.59 (5.22 × 10-14, 6.61 × 1012) >.99\n  \u0007Tuberculosis Smoking\n7.86 × 10-4 (0, 6.34 × 1029)\n.987\nCombined\n  \u0007Number of coexisting disorders × Smoking\n0.58 (0.31, 0.95)\n.043\nFigure 1.  The ranking chart of the two accuracy indicators.

We aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users\nand Twitter accounts representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking from\nJanuary 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. We analyzed sentiment, likes, or\nretweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to ﬁnd pieces of news that could affect\nthe discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on\nCOVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less\nnegative in April when preprints suggesting beneﬁts from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends\nwere observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry\nconcerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the\ndevelopment of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there\nis no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting beneﬁts of\nsmoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus. The\nauthors of potentially controversial articles should restrain from the promotion of their results before the\ncompletion of the peer-review process. Twitter presents a convenient tool to monitor e-discourse during a health\ncrisis. The research community should monitor the tobacco industry’s social media.\nKeywords: Twitter, COVID-19, coronavirus, smoking, tobacco industry, social networking\nIntroduction\nA\nssociation between smoking and coronavirus disease\n2019 (COVID-19) prognosis is a subject of scientiﬁc\ndispute.1–3 Even though smokers seem to represent a\ndisproportionately small part of hospitalized patients,3,4 a\nmeta-analysis of Chinese studies did not show a signiﬁcant\nassociation between smoking and the severity of COVID-\n19.5 Farsalinos et al. concluded that smoking is generally\nharmful, but nicotine may be considered as a treatment option\nfor COVID-19 due to low prevalence of smokers among\npatients hospitalized in China.6 The preprint of the article by\nFarsalinos et al. was published on April 4, 2020.7 Two recent\npreprints suggested that smokers might be less susceptible to\nCOVID-19 than nonsmokers.8,9 Changeux et al. presented a\nhypothesis that nicotine may compete with SARS-CoV-2 in\nbinding to the nicotine acetylcholine receptor that might be\nengaged in inﬂammatory response during infection.8 Im-\nportantly, the authors admitted that overall smoking has se-\nvere health consequences. Miyara et al. found that the\nprevalence of daily smokers among symptomatic COVID-19\npatients treated in one French hospital and outpatients were\nlower than the prevalence of smokers in general population.9\nHowever, the authors confused terms incidence with preva-\nlence, there were concerns on deﬁnitions of former smokers,\nand the study group came from one health center excluding\npatients in intensive care units, which is the strongest source\nof bias. Nevertheless, most of the studies pointed out that\nsmoking may worsen the COVID-19 course.10–13\nSmokers tend to rationalize their behavior.14,15 Studies\nsuggesting the beneﬁts of using tobacco products during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic might be used by smokers to justify\n1Department of the Treatment of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders, and of Clinical Dietetics, Poznan´ University of Medical Sciences,\nPoznan´, Poland.\n2Faculty of Medicine I, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.\nCYBERPSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIOR, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING\nVolume 23, Number 12, 2020\nª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\nDOI: 10.1089/cyber.2020.0384\n811\nDownloaded by 78.131.127.91 from www.liebertpub.com at 04/01/25.

For this reason, France\nlimited sales of tobacco products in a few days after the\nChangeux et al. and Miyara et al. preprints8,9 became viral.16\nFurthermore, the threat of the prolonged lockdown, supply\nchain breakage, or government bans on tobacco products\nmay drive consumers to stock up these goods.17,18 Finally,\nthe tobacco industry may promote its products by dissemi-\nnating the results of selected preprints.\nTwitter is a popular network of microblogs. The pieces of\nnews are disseminated by short messages called ‘‘tweets.’’\nAll of the tweets may receive feedback in the forms of a\ncommentary, favorite tags (also called likes), or sharing\n(‘‘retweet’’). Twitter users create social networks by ‘‘fol-\nlowing’’ others accounts. The tweets are one of the most\npopular\ndata\nsources\nfor\nanalyzing\nhealth\nissues\nin\ne-discourse.19 The Twitter data were used to investigate the\neffects of an antismoking campaign,20 posts and networks of\npeople who vape21 or use JUUL\u0002 e-cigarettes,22,23 as well\nas those who struggled with smoking cessation.24\nTo date, no study investigated the social media data on\nusing tobacco products during the COVID-19 pandemic. We\nhypothesize that analysis of tweets on COVID-19 and\nsmoking may show what information generates the most\nattention, and how the discourse changes over time. Fur-\nthermore, the investigation may unravel how the tobacco\nindustry communicates and promotes during the pandemic.\nWe aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking\ncoming from (1) casual Twitter users and (2) Twitter ac-\ncounts representing the tobacco industry in the scope of\nprogression of the pandemic as well as studies on smoking or\nvaping, and severity of COVID-19.\nMaterials and Methods\nData collection\nThis study processed Twitter data, thus, did not require\nethical committee approval. The research does not violate the\nterms of the platform.\nInitially, we connected with ofﬁcial Twitter application\nprogramming interface (API) using R package rtweet,25 and\ncollected all tweets including terms related to COVID-19\n(‘‘COVID,’’ ‘‘coronavirus,’’ ‘‘pandemic,’’ ‘‘SARS,’’ and\n‘‘CoV’’), and smoking (‘‘smoking,’’ ‘‘cigarette,’’ ‘‘vaping,’’\n‘‘smoke,’’ and ‘‘nicotine’’) in the nine days preceding the day\nof the collection (April 28, 2020). We obtained the original\ntweets coming from 22,613 different users. Furthermore, we\nused function get_timeline() from rtweet package25 to collect\nall tweets since January 1, 2020, to May 1, 2020, from the\nidentiﬁed accounts.\nWe identiﬁed Twitter accounts representing six tobacco\ncompanies (Phillip Morris International, British American\nTobacco, Imperial Brands, Japan Tobacco International,\nAltria, and China Tobacco), and their branches in 47 coun-\ntries (European Countries, Commonwealth, Norway, Swit-\nzerland, United States, India, Turkey, Russia, Japan, South\nAfrica, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile). We searched\nfor account names using Google and Twitter built-in search\nengines. Finally, we found a total n = 39 different accounts,\nand collected tweets related to COVID-19 from January 1,\n2020, to May 1, 2020, using rtweet package.25\nData analysis\nWe calculated relative reactions to each tweet by dividing\nlikes or retweets to the number of followers of the account.\nThe higher ratios mean that tweets gained more attention of\nTwitter users. We performed a sentiment analysis on tweets\nwritten in English using the tidytext R package.26 First, we\nperformed unnesting tokenization to words, which is a pro-\ncess of splitting text into single words. Then we removed\nstop words, which are the most commonly used words but\nhave a secondary role in the meaning of a sentence—such as\nprepositions (e.g., ‘‘in,’’ ‘‘with,’’ and ‘‘through’’) or con-\njunctions (e.g., ‘‘and,’’ ‘‘for,’’ and ‘‘or’’).\nFinally, we combined the collection of words representing\neach tweet with a sentiment dictionary called ‘‘Bing.’’27 The\ndictionary describes >6,700 English words by terms ‘‘posi-\ntive’’ or ‘‘negative.’’ For instance, words such as ‘‘easy,’’\n‘‘fortune,’’ and ‘‘pride’’ are classiﬁed as positive, whereas\n‘‘angry,’’ ‘‘concern,’’ and ‘‘impossible’’ are classiﬁed as\nnegative. We calculated sentiment by subtracting the\nnumber of positive and negative words of each tweet.\nFurthermore, we wrote annotation of time trends according\nto the COVID-19 timeline,28 and publication of preprints\nsuggesting neutral/beneﬁcial effects of smoking on the\nCOVID-19 course. We performed a network analysis of the\npair words in the tweets. We visualized pairs occurring at\nleast 100 times in the data set.\nThe tweets coming from tobacco industry accounts were\nanalyzed independently by two authors (M.K. and A.M.).\nThe senior author refereed all discrepancies. We distin-\nguished four types of tweets on emotional support (e.g., for\npeople who stay at home), ﬁnancial support (e.g., support of\nhealth care workers), scientiﬁc research, and corporate af-\nfairs (e.g., announcement of current remote work policy). If\nthe tweets were not written in English, we used Google\nTranslate to catch the context using the language label of\ntweets provided by API.\nResults\nWe collected a total of 22,644,994 tweets from the ana-\nlyzed casual Twitter accounts, of which 33,890 (0.15 per-\ncent) concerned both smoking and COVID-19.\nThe sentiment of tweets was generally negative and was\nthe lowest in mid-March. The undertone became less nega-\ntive in April when Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\npublished a statement on COVID-19 and vaping.29 At that\ntime, preprints suggesting beneﬁcial effects of tobacco\nproducts were posted online, and the sentiment of tweets\nincreases (Fig. 1A). The likes and retweets to followers ratios\nwere the lowest at the end of February and peaked in April\nwhen preprints suggesting beneﬁcial effects of nicotine on\nCOVID-19 occurred (Fig. 1B, C).\nIn the network analysis, COVID-19 and smoking dis-\ncourse focused on several topics: the French study on the\npotential beneﬁcial effects of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 in-\nfection, nicotine patches, smoking as a risk factor, smoking\ncessation, and cigarette sales online (Fig. 2).\nWe identiﬁed a total of 2,250 tweets posted by tobacco\nindustry accounts, of which 58 (2.6 percent) mentioned\nCOVID-19. Of them, 11 (19.0 percent) concerned emotional\nsupport, 3 (5.2 percent) ﬁnancial support, 28 (48.3 percent)\nscientiﬁc research, and 16 (27.6 percent) corporate affairs.\n812\nKAMIN´ SKI ET AL.\nDownloaded by 78.131.127.91 from www.liebertpub.com at 04/01/25.

For personal use only. \nInitially, the undertone decreased and reached the nadir when\nthe WHO announced the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, the\nsentiment became less negative and ﬂuctuated after the oc-\ncurrence of potential good pieces of news for smokers. Unger\net al. suggested that users tweeting on smoking are more\nlikely to consume tobacco products.33 Therefore, the senti-\nment may reﬂect the attitude of smokers on the viral news on\nsmoking during the pandemic. A similar pattern concerned\nchanges in relative reaction on analyzed tweets. The results\nmay suggest that the more hopeful (or less negative) infor-\nmation on smoking and the coronavirus gains more attention.\nInterestingly, previous studies found that most of the tweets\non smoking have positive sentiment.34,35 Here, smoking in\nthe context of COVID-19 was generally negative. The cur-\nrent situation could be scaring for Twitter users who use\nnicotine products. The network analysis suggested that the\ntweets are related to safety, availability, cessation of smok-\ning, and recent researches rather than recreational use of\ntobacco products to relax during the pandemic.\nWe found that only a minority of tobacco industry tweets\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic concerned the virus. Over\none of three was related to the efforts of vaccine develop-\nment by the tobacco industry. On the one hand, we may hope\nthat the companies create a safe vaccine with good preven-\ntive effect. On the other hand, possible success might be\nutilized for the protection of the tobacco industry public\nimage. Therefore, it is a great responsibility of regulators and\nreviewers to ensure that the development and assessment of\nthe vaccine (not only produced by tobacco industry-related\ncompanies) are rigorous, and without bias.\nTwo tweets of tobacco industry accounts mentioned an\nFDA statement on the association between vaping and risk of\nCOVID-19. Regrettably, the link from the second tweet ex-\npired, and we could not have veriﬁed it. It probably included\ninformation on FDA statement on vaping and COVID-19.29\nTo date, there is no clinical evidence that vaping may worsen\nthe course of COVID-19. Most of the e-cigarette users are\nyoung and more likely to undergo the disease without any or\nwith only mild symptoms; thus, the effects of vaping may be\nundetectable. However, the smoking of e-cigarettes may\ncontribute to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) re-\nceptor upregulation, which is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2.36\nThe increase of ACE2 receptors may increase susceptibility\nto COVID-19. Finally, the general knowledge of e-cigarette\nsuggests that by increasing cardiovascular risk,37 the vaping\nmay worsen the prognosis of the disease. The effects\nof vaping on COVID-19 need to be established in further\nresearch.\nIt is worth considering the spread of news on beneﬁcial\nproperties of smoking on COVID-19 from a psychological\nperspective. People tend to favor information that conﬁrms\ntheir personal beliefs or behavior.38 Therefore, the current\nsmokers may be more eager to post, like, or share tweets on\nbeneﬁts from smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTwitter users tend to follow their friends and acquaintances\nand authorities with similar beliefs or accounts, disseminat-\ning important information.39,40 In such circumstances, the\nconﬁrmation bias might also be enhanced by the social proof\nphenomenon.41 However, when a Twitter user meets with\nthe opposite opinion, he/she may experience cognitive dis-\nsonance.42 To diminish the distress, the user will search for\ninformation proving his/her position or to not react to the\ntweet. Therefore, even low-quality researches may resonate\nwith the beliefs of a Twitter user and can be promptly dis-\nseminated through social networks.\nStrengths and practical implications\nThe study is another example of using Twitter data for\ntobacco research. Here, we presented changes over time of\ntext sentiment and reaction to posts coming from casual\nTwitter users. We provided a good example of how the\ndissemination\nof\ncontroversial\npreprints\nmodiﬁes\nthe\ne-discourse on smoking and COVID-19. To our best\nknowledge, one of the preprints already mentioned was\npublished to date.6 Therefore, the authors of the potentially\nhighly controversial articles should consider restraining from\nthe promotion or even dissemination of the article before the\ncompletion of the peer-review process. The controversies\npropel the science, but in France, preprint caused a rush for\nnicotine products and further government intervention.16\nFurthermore, we monitored tweets related to COVID-19\ncoming from tobacco industry accounts. The industry did not\nuse the preprints suggesting beneﬁcial effects of smoking on\nCOVID-19. Owing to the lack of effective treatment of se-\nvere COVID-19 all potential even unproven therapies gain\nattetion.43 Therefore, it is important to vigilantly observe\ntobacco companies, whether they promote weak and biased\nprotobacco studies.\nLimitations\nThe study has several limitations. First, only a minority of\nthe tweets concerned both COVID-19 and smoking. Second,\nwe analyzed only posts of casual users written in English;\nthus, the results cannot be generalized. Finally, we analyzed\ndata coming from one social media platform. However, this\nis counterbalanced by a broad analysis of a considerable\nnumber of tweets spanning several weeks.\nConclusion\nPreprints suggesting the beneﬁts of smoking in COVID-19\nmight increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco\nproducts and the virus. The authors of controversial articles\nshould restrain from the promotion and dissemination of\ntheir work before completion of the peer-review process.\nTwitter may be a convenient tool to monitor e-discourse\nduring a health crisis. Research community should monitor\nthe tobacco industry’s social media.\nEthical Committee\nThis study processed Twitter data, thus, did not require\nethical committee approval. The research does not violate the\nterms of the platform.\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\nNo competing ﬁnancial interests exist.\nFunding Information\nNo funding was received for this article.\nSMOKING AND COVID-19 ON TWITTER\n815\nDownloaded by 78.131.127.91 from www.liebertpub.com at 04/01/25.

Our aim was to reflect passive smoking as a risk factor in the current pandemic. Studies are needed to \nincrease our knowledge on passive smoking and Covid-19 implications. The reflections current findings strongly support interventions \nand policies to curb the tobacco epidemic.\nKEYWORDS: Tobacco Smoke Pollution. Coronavirus Infections. Smoking Prevention.\nReflections on passive smoking and COVID-19\nLeilinéia Pereira Ramos de Rezende Garcia1\n, Cibelly Correia Souza Abreu1\n,  \nAdriana Helena de Matos Abe2\n, Marcos André de Matos3*\nPOINT OF VIEW\nhttps://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.67.Suppl1.20201047\nActive smoking has been a global concern and is consid-\nered an ancient pandemic with long and chronic progression1,2. \nCurrently, the number of deaths due to smoking is estimated \nat 8 million, including 157,000 in Brazil2.\nAlthough underestimated, passive smoking, that is, the \ninhalation of second-hand smoke from tobacco derivatives, \nis also an important public health concern as it exposes non-\nsmokers to the same carcinogens3. Thus, it is an important \nrisk factor for chronic noncommunicable diseases, especially \nlung cancer1,4.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), \n900,000 passive smokers die annaully2. In Brazil, a survey con-\nducted in the 26 state capitals and the Federal District reported \nthat 6.8% of household members were passive smokers, includ-\ning 7.0% of women and 6.6% of men. The percentage of pas-\nsive smokers in the workplace was 6.6% and was higher for \nmen (10.0%) than for women (3.7%)5.\nThe harmful effect of tobacco was first reported in 19286. \nSince then, efforts have been made to establish coping strat-\negies. However, the United States Department of Health \ndemonstrated the causal relationship between passive smoking \nand lung cancer only in the year 1964. In 2005, the WHO \nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC/WHO) \nprovided tools and guidelines to be implemented by more than \n192 member countries7.\nEven with most countries implementing anti-smoking pol-\nicies, approximately 80% of people remain vulnerable to harm-\nful effects resulting from passive smoking8. Cigarette burning \nproduces smoke that contains more than 7,000 chemical com-\npounds. Of which 250 are proved to be harmful, and nearly \n70 of these compounds and substances cause cancer9. Oral and \nnasal inhalation of cigarette smoke is believed to profoundly \ndecrease in vivo mucociliary transport, making the person sus-\nceptible to respiratory diseases9.\nAt the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \noutbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the tro-\npism of lung epithelial cells was identified, caused by severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)10,11. \nSmokers are considered among the vulnerable groups to health \ncomplications resulting from COVID-1911.\n1Universidade Federal de Goiás, Institute of Pathology and Tropical Medicine, Program in Collective Health – Goiânia (GO), Brasil.\n2Universidade Federal de Goiás, Hospital das Clínicas – Goiânia (GO), Brasil.\n3Universidade Federal de Goiás, School of Nursing – Goiânia (GO), Brasil.\n*Corresponding author: marcosmatos@ufg.br\nConflicts of interest: the authors declare there are no conflicts of interest.

R. et al.\n23\nRev Assoc Med Bras 2021;67(Suppl 1):22-25\nSmoking increases the expression of angiotensin-converting \nenzyme 2 (ACE2), a known SARS-CoV-2 receptor. While some \nstudies have proposed the higher ACE2 expression in smok-\ners as a possible link between smoking and COVID-19, these \nmechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated12,13. Although this \nrelationship remains controversial, there are large investments \nin research on this topic. However, studies on passive smoking \nand COVID-19 remain scarce; thus, this condition may be an \nimportant risk factor that has not been considered in the rec-\nommendations for pandemic control.\nA study by Vázquez and Redolar-Ripoll11 conducted in \nSpain showed that, although the percentage of men (50.4%) \nand women (49.6%) infected by SARS-CoV-2 was similar, the \nmortality rate was significantly higher in men (4.7%) than in \nwomen (2.6%). These authors suggested that these discrep-\nancies could be owing to differences in smoking patterns and \nprevalence between the sexes, as corroborated by statistical data \non the prevalence of male smokers (25.6%) and female smok-\ners (18.8%) in Spain.\nA recent meta-analysis including data of 11,322 ­COVID-19 \npatients published in the International Prospective Register of \nSystematic Reviews (PROSPERO) has shown an association \nbetween smoking history and severe COVID-19 disease (OR \n2.17, 95%CI 1.37–3.46, p<0.001) as well as current smoking \nand severe COVID-19 disease (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.12–2.05, \np<0.008)14.\nAdditionally, some studies have shown that smoking ces-\nsation, over time, leads to normalization of a part of the respi-\nratory epithelium architecture, with decreased hyperplasia and \ndownregulation of ACE2 levels. It also significantly improves \nendothelial function15. However, this relationship has not been \nestablished in passive smokers.\nAlthough there is no robust evidence of this association, the \nWHO strongly advises that smokers to quit smoking to mini-\nmize its direct risks2. In this context, it is necessary to consider \nthe limited discussion of passive smoking, which is so com-\nmon in society, as a risk factor for COVID-19. This discus-\nsion encourages the disclosure of warnings on tobacco prod-\nuct packaging and media campaigns that inform the dangers \nof passive smoking2,16.\nIn the past, respiratory virus epidemics and pandemics \ndemonstrated the significant role of multifaceted approaches \nto smoking cessation through behavioral, cultural, and phar-\nmacological interventions17. These approaches may also be \nuseful to decrease passive smoking in the current pandemic.\nConsidering the high viral transmissibility, severity in most \nvulnerable groups, and, above all, current lack of a proven vac-\ncine and treatment, social isolation has always been the trans-\nversal axis of COVID-19 prevention and control measures. \nHowever, aspects related to prevention practices and attitudes \ntoward risk factors, such as passive smoking, have not been \nadequately addressed.\nA Chinese study showed a higher proportion of lung can-\ncers attributable to passive smoking in the household (19.5%) \nthan in the workplace (7.2%) among women. The main expla-\nnation was the greater number of women exposed to passive \nsmoking in the household (66.0%) than at work (19.6%)18.\nAccording to a survey conducted on adults aged ≥40 years \nin China, 37.7% of people who never smoked and reported \nexposure to passive smoking were usually exposed at home \nand only 7.1% were exposed at work. Therefore, the house-\nhold is the predominant place of exposure to passive smoking, \nmainly for women and children. This may cause a displace-\nment effect owing to smoke-free legislation, with a net effect \nof people increasingly smoking at home to avoid restrictions \nin public places, and owing to the social isolation caused by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The main recommendation is to \nestablish public health policies to reduce passive smoking in \nthe household in times of pandemic18 and to invest in studies \nthat analyze the impact of active smoking on SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection.\nThe potential smoking-related COVID-19 disseminators \nrequire reviewing. Hookahs, popular among younger population \nowing to their reduced damage, produce much more smoke than \ncommercial cigarettes19, directly interfering with the air quality \nand the health of nearby people. Additionally, the mouthpieces \nare shared, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 transmission2,20.\nThe transmission of diseases such as influenza, cold sores, \nand tuberculosis through hookah mouthpieces has also been \nreported21. Sharing electronic smoke devices also increase the \nrisk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission2,19.\nThus, people who are exposed daily to thousands of toxic \nsubstances from tobacco smoke are at risk of developing serious \ndisorders22. such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease, and cancer, and may additionally be more \nsusceptible to SARS-CoV-2.\nThis review concludes with the idea that passive smoking \nmay be an important risk factor for COVID-19 and provides \nreflections on the associated factors and processes that involve \nrespiratory diseases, as well as their significance. It is important \nfor the population to be aware of these risks of passive smok-\ning, since the use of tobacco in certain forms discussed above \nmay increase the risk of developing COVID-19, leading to \nmore serious and potentially fatal conditions.\nThe possible relationship of government finance with the \ntobacco industry should also be considered, with these data \ninforming potential tobacco control measures in Brazil. It is \nimportant to increase the awareness of the dangers of smoking \nReflections on passive smoking and COVID-19\n24\nRev Assoc Med Bras 2021;67(Suppl 1):22-25\ncigarettes, as well as the importance of reducing their use, \nregardless of their harm1,23,24.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is the right time to pass \non these recommendations, mainly to non-active smokers, as \nwell as to the users of tobacco, who should be greatly con-\ncerned about their health. Increased smoking cessation rates \ncould positively impact the community transmission of SARS-\nCoV-2 and decrease the risks and concerns of passive smokers.\nThus, campaign practices and concepts should be reviewed, \nwith a focus on the results of populations who are currently expe-\nriencing social isolation in enclosed environments. An increased \nunderstanding of the impact of these factors on the daily lives \nof smokers, informed by established theoretical tools, will allow \nthe modification of pedagogical strategies.\nThe current situation reinforces the need to increase awareness \nabout the risks of passive smoking. There is a critical window \nof opportunity to help individuals quit smoking and increase \nsurveillance in both the active and passive smoking population \nto prevent, detect, and quickly treat COVID-19.\nReflection on these findings indicates the need for greater \ninstrumentalization from everyone involved in this process to \nguarantee the quality of the interventions. Reviews of these con-\ncepts, how they are presented to the public, and how they are \nrelated to the primary objective of health campaigns, namely, \nhealth promotion and the effects of the quality of life of pop-\nulation are needed.\nThis review may contribute to the proposed reflection pro-\ncess and expanded discussions on this topic to strengthen strat-\negies and expand their scope not only quantitatively but also \nqualitatively. Studies and healthcare practices related to the \ncurrent pandemic are needed to increase our knowledge on \npassive smoking and COVID-19 implications.\nFinally, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should be an impetus \nfor patients and people at risk to maintain good health prac-\ntices and to quit smoking not only because of the current sit-\nuation but also permanently.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the teachers and staff of Program in Collective \nHealth, Institute of Pathology and Tropical Medicine, Federal \nUniversity of Goiás, National Council for Scientific and \nTechnological Development (CNPq), and MCTIC/CNPq/\nFNDCT/MS/SCTIE/Decit N°. 07/2020 for the financial support.\nAUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION\nLPRRG: Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – Original \nDraft.

Thus, it is difﬁcult to assess the relationship between smoking\nand COVID-19. Smoking can increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and\naggravate the condition of patients with COVID-19. Nicotine upregulates the expression\nof ACE2, which can also increase susceptibility to COVID-19, aggravatiing the disease.\nAlthough nicotine has certain anti-inﬂammatory effects, there is no evidence that it is\nrelated to COVID-19 treatment; therefore, smoking cannot be considered a preventative\nmeasure. Furthermore, smokers gathering and sharing tobacco may promote the\nspread of viruses. Despite the COVID-19 epidemic, the ﬁndings suggested that COVID-\n19 has not encouraged smokers to quit. Additionally, there is evidence that isolation\nat home has contributed to increased smoking behavior and increased quantities.\nTherefore, it is recommended that governments increase smoking cessation messaging\nas part of public health measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. This review\nanalyzes the existing research on smoking’s impact on COVID-19 so that governments\nand medical institutions can develop evidence-based smoking-related prevention and\ncontrol measures for COVID-19.\nKeywords: COVID-19, smoking, tobacco, electronic cigarette, viral transmission\nINTRODUCTION\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by an infection from a new type of coronavirus.\nThe virus was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the\nInternational Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and it\nbelongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (β-COV) (Graham et al., 2013; Song et al., 2019). The genetic\nsequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 79.5% similar to SARS-CoV, and the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to\nenter the human body is the same as that used by SARS-CoV, namely, the angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) (Lu et al., 2020). However, the binding aﬃnity of the spiked envelope of SARS-\nCoV-2 to human ACE2 is approximately 10–20 times that of SARS-CoV, with an extremely high\nrate of human-to-human infection and rate (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020).\nFrom December 2019, it took only a few months for the new coronavirus, which causes\npneumonia, to spread from sporadic regional outbreaks to countries to worldwide. The number\nof patients aﬀected, the seriousness of the disease, and the high mortality rate are unprecedented.\nAs of February 21, 2021 (Beijing time), the latest report of the World Health Organization\n(WHO) showed that the number of conﬁrmed cases of new COVID-19 worldwide was more\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n1\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 603850\nXie et al.\nCOVID-19 and Smoking\nthan 111.69 million people (111,696,136), with an estimated 2.46\nmillion deaths. The United States (with approximately 28.67\nmillion cases) and India with (approximately 10.99 million cases)\nare reportedly the most severely aﬀected countries. There is still\nno eﬀective treatment for COVID-19.\nAt this stage, the clinical characteristics of patients with the\nnew coronavirus are still being explored in-depth; moreover,\nepidemiological data show higher morbidity and mortality\nrates from COVID-19 among the older adults and those\nwith lower immunity and prior illnesses (cancer, hypertension,\ndiabetes, and especially respiratory diseases) (Du et al., 2020;\nSalako et al., 2020). Smoking is a major risk factor for\ncommon chronic diseases (Tonnesen et al., 2019), especially\nthose closely related to the occurrence and development of\nrespiratory diseases. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the role\nof cigarette smoking on COVID-19 has been a controversial\nissue. This article reviews the latest research and evidence on\nsmoking and COVID-19 to be used as a reference by medical\ninstitutions and clinicians.\nSMOKING INCREASES THE RISK OF\nVIRAL RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS\nCOVID-19 is primarily transmitted through the respiratory tract\n(saliva), and smokers may be at increased risk of contracting\nthe virus due to reduced lung function, impaired immune\nsystems, cross-infection, and susceptible hygiene habits (Zhou\net al., 2016; Ahmed et al., 2020). Cigarette smoking also\nincreases the amount of forced vital capacity (FVC) and\nstimulates hyperproliferation of the bronchial mucosal glands,\nresulting in increased mucosal permeability, excessive mucus\nproduction and inhibitedclearance of mucosal cilia, reducing\nthe airway puriﬁcation function and harmful microorganisms\nscreening in the upper respiratory system, leading to potential\npulmonary inﬂammation.\nIn a prospective study that explored smoking and alcohol\nconsumption’s suppression of host resistance to viral infections,\n391 participants were exposed to ﬁve respiratory viruses\n(including coronavirus type, respiratory syncytial virus and three\nrhinovirus types rhinovirue). The results showed that smoking\nincreased the risk of infection (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.03–\n4.82), as well as the risk of developing clinical symptoms after\ninfection (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.00–3.36) (Cohen et al., 1993).\nAnother cell experimental study showed that when infected by\nthe virus, cigarette smoke extracts preconditioned RSV-infected\ncells to cause cell necrosis rather than apoptosis, resulting\nin increased inﬂammation and increased viral replication\n(Groskreutz et al., 2009). Thus, smoking can increase the risk of\nviral respiratory infections.\nA systematic review analyzed the current evidence and\nquantiﬁed the risk of inﬂuenza infection between smokers and\nnon-smokers. Nine studies with a total of 40,695 participants\nwere included in this review, of which three were laboratory-\nconﬁrmed case-control studies of inﬂuenza showing that current\nsmokers were 5 times more likely to develop inﬂuenza than non-\nsmokers (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.73–0.99). In six studies reporting\nthe occurrence of inﬂuenza-like illness, current smokers were\n34% more likely to have inﬂuenza than non-smokers (OR = 1.34;\n95% CI: 1.13–1.69) (Lawrence et al., 2019). Jaspers et al. (2010)\nreported that in the early stage of inﬂuenza virus infection, the\nantiviral defense ability of smokers’ nasal epithelial cells was\ninhibited, namely, the signal transduction of type I interferon\n(IFN) was inhibited, IFN-α and IRF7 (a key transcription factor\ncontrolling the expression of IFN-α) expression was reduced,\nwhich would increase smokers’ susceptibility to the inﬂuenza\nvirus. Meanwhile, Noah et al. (2011) suggested that the inhibition\nof type 1 IFN signal transduction would facilitate the replication\nof the inﬂuenza virus in smokers and individuals exposed to\ntobacco smoke. Therefore, it would increase the number of\ninﬂuenza viruses.\nTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SMOKING AND\nCOVID-19\nThe WHO stated that 1.4–18.5% of hospitalized COVID-\n19 adult patients were smokers (World Health Organization,\n2020a). Some scholars believe the prevalence of COVID-19\nin Chinese men was higher than among women because the\nsmoking rate among Chinese men was much higher than\nwomen (Underner et al., 2020). Some studies do not support\nthe above conclusions. Farsalinos et al. (2020) conducted a\nsystematic analysis of 13 studies from China (including 5,960\npatients) indicating the current prevalence of smoking among\nhospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 6.5% (95% CI: 4.9–\n8.2%) based on a pooled estimate; In the secondary analysis,\nthe unknown data were adjusted (integrating former smokers\ninto the group of current smokers), and the pooled estimate\nof smoking prevalence was 7.3% (95% CI: 5.7–8.9%), which is\nstill far lower than the prevalence of smoking among Chinese\nresidents (26.6%). Tsigaris and Teixeira da Silva (2020) conducted\nan ecological study of 38 European countries, and after strictly\ncontrolling for confounding factors, smoking prevalence was\nsigniﬁcantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence\n(P = 0.001). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 233 studies showed\n(Simons et al., 2020), current smokers compared with never\nsmokers were at reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-\n2 infection (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.24–0.64); But former smokers\ncompared with never smokers were at increased hospitalization\nrisk (RR = 1.20; 95% CI: 0.06–0.37).\nSome researchers suggested that studies on smoking and\nCOVID-19 have similar limitations, namely, they cannot\naccurately determine people’s current smoking status (Emami\net al., 2020; Harapan et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Miyara\net al., 2020; Petrilli et al., 2020). There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences\nbetween these incomplete patient health histories and actual\nsmoking behavior, leading to the underestimation of current\nsmoking rates of COVID-19 patients, which also caused a certain\ndeviation in the early evaluation of the COVID-19 infection\nrate and smoking status (Polubriaginof et al., 2018; Lippi et al.,\n2020; Patanavanich and Glantz, 2020). Exposure to SARS-CoV-\n2 was heterogeneous, with higher infection risk in diﬀerent\nsubgroups at diﬀerent stages of the pandemic, and some research\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n2\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 603850\nXie et al.\nCOVID-19 and Smoking\nanalyses are based on unadjusted ORs (calculated for age and\nother confounding factors) (Feldman and Anderson, 2013; Leung\net al., 2020; Lippi and Henry, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Zhong et al.,\n2021), even some peer-reviewed meta-analyses investigating the\nassociation between smoking and COVID-19 were based on\nunadjusted ORs (Lippi and Henry, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Zheng\net al., 2020). Therefore, the reliability of these studies needs to\nbe conﬁrmed. Also, smokers were more likely to have symptoms\nsimilar to COVID-19, such as cough and sputum, making them\nmore likely to accept SARS-CoV-2 testing, even if they may not\nbe infected, this included with the object selection bias would\nincrease the negative samples detection rate, creating a bias\n(Cole et al., 2010; de Lusignan et al., 2020). Thus, the single\nsmoking rate of patients cannot be used to judge the relationship\nbetween smoking and COVID-19, scientists need to be cautious\nin assessing the impact of smoking on COVID-19.\nSMOKING AND COVID-19 DISEASE\nPROGNOSIS\nIn April 2020, the WHO announced that smokers were more\nlikely to develop serious illness from COVID-19 than non-\nsmokers (World Health Organization, 2020b). More studies have\nshown that smoking is associated with the prognosis of COVID-\n19 infection, and current and former smoking is signiﬁcantly\nassociated with the risk of serious illness from COVID-19\n(Grundy et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). During previous inﬂuenza\noutbreaks (MERS-CoV), smokers were twice as likely to be\ninfected with inﬂuenza and had more severe symptoms as non-\nsmokers, and had a higher mortality rate (Arcavi and Benowitz,\n2004; Park et al., 2018). Vardavas and Nikitara (2020) reported\nthat from the initial original study of COVID-19 in China,\nsmokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-\n19 symptoms than non-smokers (RR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.98–\n2.00), and smokers were approximately 2.4 times more likely\nto be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Smokers may\nrequire mechanical ventilation more often than non-smokers\nor they may be more likely to die. In a single-center study,\nZhao et al. (2020) showed that on-going smoking increased\nthe risk of developing severe COVID-19 by approximately 2-\nfold (OR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.29–3.05), and COPD patients who\ndeveloped severe COVID-19 symptoms had a >4-fold increased\nrisk (OR = 4.38; 95% CI: 2.34–8.20). However, the analysis of\nthe subgroup revealed (the largest sample size was excluded\nfor a sensitivity analysis) that the eﬀect of active smoking on\nCOVID-19 severity was no longer signiﬁcant. In COVID-19\npatients with chronic diseases, a history of respiratory and\ncardiovascular diseases accelerated deterioration, and smoking\nwas closely associated with the development of these diseases\n(Wang B. et al., 2020; Wang X. et al., 2020).\nMost of these studies conﬁrmed that cigarette smoking\ncan aggravate COVID-19 symptoms in patients, which may\nbe caused by a variety of chronic diseases related to smoking,\nespecially because smoking can damage lung function and the\nimmune system, causing a reduced ability to ﬁght COVID-19.\nCigarette smoking also causes excessive airway secretions,\nimpaired\ndrainage\nduring\nexpectoration,\nand\nimpaired\nventilation function, all of which increase susceptibility to\nacute respiratory tract dysfunction due to sudden phlegm\nasphyxiation. Furthermore, cigarette smoke can activate the\nautophagy-dependent mechanism mediated by the deacetylase\nHDAC6, while causes the cilia proteins to be delivered to\nthe lysosome for degradation or recycling, shortening the\nairway cilia (Lam et al., 2013). The excessive activation of\nautophagy may eventually lead to programmed epithelial cell\ndeath, contributing to impaired mucociliary clearance (Cloonan\net al., 2014). It can also reduce the A-kinase anchoring protein\nexpression (AKAP)-9 in vitro to cause e-cadherin-mediated\nbarrier function destruction of airway epithelial cells, leading to\nincreased infection risk by viruses and bacteria that exacerbate\nCOPD (Oldenburger et al., 2014). At the same time, cigarette\nsmoking activates MAPKs in the lung, increasing the number of\nneutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, and other\ncells, and inducing cells to release pro-inﬂammatory factors and\nchemokines in Figure 1 (Barnes, 2009; Chung, 2011). This results\nin acute lung inﬂammation, such as neutrophil inﬁltration, the\nmRNA expression of TNF-α and MIP-2, proteinase expression\n(MMP-12\nmRNA),\nand\noxidative\nDNA\ndamage,\ncausing\nrespiratory barrier dysfunction and epithelial cell death. It\nalso promotes the development of chronic inﬂammation\nin COPD and other related diseases (Marumo et al., 2014;\nAghapour et al., 2018).\nNICOTINE AFFECTS ACE2 EXPRESSION,\nINCREASES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\nCOVID-19, AND CAUSES AGGRAVATION\nOF THE DISEASE\nThe angiotensin-converting-enzyme II (ACE2) receptor is the\nconﬁrmed entry point of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into host cells\nbecause the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus membrane\nspike protein has a high aﬃnity with the ACE2 receptor on lung\nepithelial cells (Kaur et al., 2020). ACE2 expression plays a key\nrole in susceptibility to COVID-19 and is involved in innate and\nadaptive immune responses, aﬀecting the immune regulation of\nB cells and cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-1, IL-10, IL-6.). Its high\nlevels of expression may increase viral activity and promote viral\nreplication, transcription, and release (Li G. et al., 2020).\nIn the process of virus replication and transcription, the\ncombination of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 may progressively\ndownregulate the expression of ACE2 protein and reduce the\nresidual ACE2 activity (Dijkman et al., 2012), causing the renin-\nangiotensin system (RAS) to be unregulated, and then changing\nthe ACE/ACE2 Balance and producing higher ACE and/or lower\nACE2, while angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin\n(ANG) II/Ang II type I receptor (AT1R) axis could causing\nvasoconstriction, pro-inﬂammatory and pro-oxidative eﬀects. It\ncould eventually evolve into acute heart failure, ARDS, and renal\nacute failure (Garami, 2020; Henry et al., 2020).\nStudies\nhave\nconﬁrmed\nthat\nnicotine\ncan\naﬀect\nthe\nhomeostasis of the renin-angiotensin system. It can upregulate\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n3\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 603850\nXie et al.\nCOVID-19 and Smoking\nFIGURE 1 | Smoking and inﬂammatory cytokines Smoking causes activation of MAPKs in the lung, increasing the number of neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes,\nmacrophages and other cells, and inducing cells to release pro-inﬂammatory factors and chemokines. Smoking induces overexpression of ACE2 receptor and\nincreases viral adhesion. When the virus is activated and released, NF-κB-mediated signaling pathways are activated, and thus up-regulated the transcription of\ninﬂammasomal-related components. Smoking can upregulate ACE/Ang II/AT1 raxis, activate NF-κB, integral protein and ADAM17, induce TNF-α and IL-6 to the\nsoluble form sIL-6Rα, and ﬁnally activate IL-6 AMP to promote the release of inﬂammatory cytokines.\nthe ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and increase renin expression or\nactivity, ACE and AT1R, while the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas receptor\naxis can downregulate the expression or activity of ACE2/AT2R\nin Figure 2 (Russo et al., 2020). The imbalance of the RAS\nsystem caused by nicotine may promote and aggravate the\noccurrence and development of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular,\nand pulmonary diseases.\nACE2 expression is regulated by nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptors\n(nAChRs).\nThe\nnAChRs\nreceptors\nare\nwidely\ndistributed throughout the central nervous system and activate\nacetylcholine\nneurotransmitter\nsignaling\npathways,\nwhile\nnAChRs can be easily activated by nicotine (Dani and De Biasi,\n2001). When people smoke, nicotine induces overexpression\nof the ACE2 receptor in pulmonary epithelial cells (e.g.,\nbronchial epithelial cells, type II alveolar epithelial cells.) through\nnAChRα7 (Biron et al., 1969; Wang Q. et al., 2020), and studies\nhave conﬁrmed that smokers (including e-cigarettes) have higher\nserum levels of ACE-2 in Figure 2 (Brake et al., 2020). In healthy\nhuman volunteers, serum ACE activity increased signiﬁcantly\nimmediately after smoking and returned to control levels 20 min\nafter smoking cessation (Kitamura, 1987).\nFarsalinos et al. (2020) believe that upregulation of ACE2\nexpression may be induced as a defense mechanism against\nthe eﬀects of angiotensin II. In animal experiments, ACE2\nprotected mice from severe acute lung damage (Imai et al.,\n2005), while tobacco smoke exposure increased lung injury in\nACE2 knockout mice (compared with wild-type mice) (Huang\net al., 2016), further supporting the upregulation of ACE2 as\na beneﬁcial defense mechanism. Smith and Sheltzer (2020)\nreported that smoking causes a dose-dependent upregulation\nof ACE2 expression; that is, long-term smoking increases\nACE2 expression, while smoking cessation decreases ACE2\nlevels in the lungs.\nEven if upregulation of ACE2 in the initial stage of tobacco\nexposure helps prevent acute lung injury, there is no doubt\nthat upregulation of ACE2 expression can increase COVID-\n19 susceptibility, and long-term tobacco exposure can cause\nan imbalance of the body’s RAS system, leading to a series of\nchanges. Thus, it progresses the COVID-19 disease.\nNICOTINE, IL-6 AND OTHER\nPRO-INFLAMMATORY FACTORS\nOne of the main causes of death from COVID-19 is acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the main mechanism\nof ARDS is the “cytokine storm,” which is caused by immune\neﬀector cells releasing large amounts of pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines\n(e.g.,\nTNF-α,\nIFN-γ,\nIL-1β,\nIL-6,\nIL-12.)\nand\nchemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL5) (Li X. et al., 2020).\nCytokine storms can activate the immune system’s attack on\nthe body, triggering a deadly and uncontrollable systemic\ninﬂammatory response that can cause acute respiratory distress\nand multi-organ failure (Xu et al., 2020).\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n4\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 603850\nXie et al.\nCOVID-19 and Smoking\nFIGURE 2 | COVID-19 and smoking Nicotine induces overexpression of the ACE2 receptor in lung epithelial cells, increasing SARS-COV-2 virus susceptibility.\nNicotine can also deregulate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), leading to vasoconstriction, proinﬂammatory, and pro-oxidative reactions. Meanwhile, nicotine can\nincrease the release of pro-inﬂammatory factors and aggravate the inﬂammatory response. Smokers’ social behaviors for gathering to smoke can increase the\ntransmission of COVID-19.\nWhen the SARS-COV-2 virus enters the body, it can rapidly\nactivated CD4+T lymphocytes to become T helper 1 (Th1) cells to\nsecrete pro-inﬂammatory factors (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage\ncolony-stimulating factor (GC-SF), IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-7, IL-6.).\nWhile the GC-SF further activates CD14+CD16+ inﬂammatory\nmonocytes, producing a large number of IL-6, TNF-α and other\ncytokines in Figure 1 (Yonggang et al., 2020). The release of\npro-inﬂammatory factors i s consistent with the activation of\nNLRP3/inﬂammasomes (Chen et al., 2019). During COVID-19\ninfection, SARS-CoV proteins E and 3a IC induces Ca2+ eﬄux\nand activates NLRP3/inﬂammasome complex, which in turn,\ntriggers zymogen procaspase-1 to convert into the active caspase-\n1 and eventually establish the inﬂammatory caspase (Farag\net al., 2020). Inactive pro-IL-1βand pro-IL-18 were converted\nto active pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (such as IL-1βand IL-18)\n(Franchi et al., 2012). Franchi et al. (2014) found that when\npathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-\nassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) were recognized by Toll-\nlike receptors (TLRs), activating the nuclear factor kappa B\n(NF-κB) -mediated signaling pathways, and thus up-regulated\nthe transcription of inﬂammasomal-related components (Epstein\nand Dinarello, 1984). Ultimately, it stimulates the release of\nTNF and IL-6 and increases levels of TNF-α, IL-13, IL-4,\nand IL-8, contributing to acute pro-inﬂammatory response in\nFigure 1 (Martinon and Tschopp, 2007; Davis et al., 2011;\nLuigi and Gabriel, 2012; Hirano and Murakami, 2020). Hirano\nand Murakami (2020) proposed that the AngII pathway caused\npotential mechanisms for cytokine storms When the SARS-\nCOV-2 virus engulfed ACE2, the content of ACE2 on cells\ndecreased and stimulated the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis through\npattern-recognition receptors to activate NF-κB and disintegrin\nand metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17). ADAM17 can generate\nTNF-α, induction IL-6Rα to the form soluble form (sIL-6Rα),\nand then mediated by gp130-mediated to forms sIL-6Rα-IL-6\ncomplexes, ultimately activate signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription 3 (STAT3). Both NF-κB and STAT3 can activate\nIL 6 ampliﬁer (IL-6 Amp), which in turn causes various pro-\ninﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines (Figure 1).\nCigarette smoke is known to cause abnormal inﬂammatory\nactivation of the bronchial epithelium and promote damage to\nmacrophage function, increasing the risk of infection (Hiemstra,\n2013; Aghapour et al., 2018). More and more studies suggest\ncigarette smoke activates the NLRP3 inﬂammasome in the\nlung epithelium, increasing the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-\n1β, and caspase-1, enhancing the activity of Caspase-1 and the\nrelease of inﬂammasome related cytokines IL 1β and IL 18 in\nFigure 1 (Li et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2018). Buscetta et al. (2020)\nfound that cigarette smoke extract could increase the activity\nof caspase-1 through an NLRP3-independent and TLR4-TRIF-\ncaspase-8-dependent pathway, leading to a decrease in basic\nglycolytic ﬂux and response to lipopolysaccharide, which may\neventually lead to macrophage dysfunction and increase the\nrisk of infection in smokers. Simultaneously, in the context\nof subchronic electronic cigarette exposure, the body increases\nthe release of pro-inﬂammatory factors and ACE2 receptors by\nregulating nAChRα7, leading to an inﬂammatory response and\ndysregulated repair (Wang Q. et al., 2020). The De Cunto team\n(De Cunto et al., 2016) showed that, under chronic smoking\nconditions, the expression of some pro-inﬂammatory cytokines\nwas upregulated (e.g., Il-6, TNF-α, KC).\nParadoxically, nicotine was indicated to be an agonist of the\ncholinergic anti-inﬂammatory pathway. It has anti-inﬂammatory\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n5\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 603850\nXie et al.\nCOVID-19 and Smoking\nproperties and can regulate the body’s immune response. It\ncan also inhibit the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines\n(e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-6) without inhibiting the release of anti-\ninﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) (Wang H. et al., 2003).\nBecause of long-term chronic respiratory infection, the level\nof antibodies against streptococcus pneumoniae in smokers’\nbodies will increase, making it possible to have certain anti-\ninﬂammatory capabilities (Sankilampi et al., 1997; Nuorti et al.,\n2000). The most eﬀective evidence supporting the therapeutic\nanti-inﬂammatory potential of nicotine is the epidemiological\nstudy of smokers with ulcerative colitis; 90% of patients with\nulcerative colitis are non-smokers, and the symptoms of colitis\nin smokers who smoke intermittently can be improved when\nsmoking (Jenkins et al., 2005). Nicotine has been used in clinical\ntrials to treat ulcerative colitis; however, its non-speciﬁc eﬀects\nand collateral toxicity limit its clinical use (Ghia et al., 2006;\nde Jonge and Ulloa, 2007). At present, there is no certain\nevidence that nicotine increases anti-COVID-19 antibody levels\nin humans, and the mechanism of its action remains unclear.\nThese contradictions may be related to the concentration\nof nicotine. Stable nicotine dose therapy has good anti-\ninﬂammatory eﬀects. However, smoking can cause a continuous\nincrease in plasma nicotine concentration, resulting in addiction\nand adverse consequences. The WHO also stated that there is\nnot enough information to conﬁrm any connection between\ntobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-\n19. Therefore, smoking is by no means a protective measure\nagainst COVID-19. Doctors and public health professionals\nshould collect accurate smoking data, and further independent\nstudies are necessary to analyze the impact of smoking on the\nincidence rate, progression, and COVID-19 mortality.\nTOBACCO USE AND COVID-19 VIRUS\nTRANSMISSION\nThe COVID-19 virus can infect individuals of any age. The\nvirus has a wide range of transmission methods. It may spread\nthrough contact, droplets, air, pollutants, faces, etc.; however,\nits main mode of transmission is respiratory droplets. In\naddition to contact transmission, the source can be respiratory\nsecretions, droplets, aerosols and contaminated surfaces (Hui\net al., 2020). People with or without symptoms can transmit the\nvirus (Nair et al., 2017). Therefore, strict cross-infection control\nmeasures are diﬃcult to maintain due to smoking behavior\n(Wang D. et al., 2020). Smokers’ hands and cigarette ﬁlters are\ncontaminated by SARS-CoV-2 in many ways. Smokers gather\ntogether in closed environments where they chat, drink, and\npass cigarettes to other smokers, which increases the risk of\nCOVID-19 infection (Figure 2). In the meantime, cigarette\nsmoke causes users to cough or sneeze. This process produces\nlarge amounts of aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2, which can\nremain in the air for 3 h in the form of droplets or micro-aerosols,\nand they can survive as aerosols and on the surface (plastic\npaper and steel) for several hours to several days (Sherman,\n1991; Benjamin, 2011). Even if strict social distance policies are\nmaintained, contaminated humans may still be infected. Also,\nsmokeless tobacco products may contribute to the COVID-\n19 epidemic and increase susceptibility (Singh and Chaturvedi,\n2020). Users put smokeless tobacco products in their mouths,\nchew repeatedly, and ﬁnally spit them out along with saliva,\nwhich contains a variety of pathogens, including SARS-CoV-\n2. Smokeless tobacco users may exhibit behavior like spitting,\nand they often exhibit respiratory symptoms, cancer, and other\ndiseases at high incidence rates, which are closely related to the\nCOVID-19 epidemic (Siddiqi et al., 2015). Therefore, smokers’\nsocial culture may promote the spread of the virus.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC AND SMOKING\nCESSATION\nDo the home isolation policies implemented during the COVID-\n19 pandemic increase smokers’ motivation to quit? Heerfordt\nand Heerfordt (2020) investigated the global search trend of\nsmoking cessation information during the COVID-19 pandemic\n(January–April 2020) from the perspective of Google’s hot\nsearch trend and found that the search volume of smoking\ncessation information on Google did not increase signiﬁcantly\n(Tieks et al., 2019). In contrast, because of the prolonged home\nisolation and regional blockade during the pandemic, residents\nexperienced a series of symptoms, including panic, anxiety,\nsleep disturbance, etc. (Banerjee, 2020). This isolation may also\nhave had a certain impact on nicotine addicts (Pfeﬀerbaum and\nNorth, 2020), driving them to use substances, especially tobacco\nor alcohol, to relieve stress and negative emotions (García-\nÁlvarez et al., 2020). One report showed that smokers’ daily\nsmoking rates increased by 49.9% during the epidemic, which\ncould explain why the tobacco industry was unaﬀected during\nsuch a severe epidemic (Tobacco Reporter, 2020). A survey of\nsmoking behavior and psychological dynamics in Italy in April\n2020 (including 1,825 participants) showed that staying at home\ncaused most exclusive smokers to consider quitting; however,\nmost e-cigarette users did not consider stopping e-cigarettes use,\nand cigarettes and e-liquid purchases increased; one-third of\nformer smokers considered relapse (Caponnetto et al., 2020).\nAlthough the governments around the world was not very active\nregarding eﬀorts to encourage smoking cessation during the\nepidemic, the government can still encourage smokers to quit and\nmaintain their health.\nTo date, many governments and health institutions have not\nincluded smokers in the high-risk population for COVID-19\nand seldom issue warnings regarding the eﬀects of smoking on\nCOVID-19’s spread. With the studies on the relationship between\nsmoking and COVID-19, this situation may change.\nSUMMARY\nThis review clearly indicate the complexity of the relationship\nbetween smoking and COVID-19. Smoking can increased\nmucosal permeability, reducing airway puriﬁcation function and\nthe screening of harmful microorganisms, increasing the risk\nof viral of respiratory infections and aggravating the severity\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n6\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 603850\nXie et al.\nCOVID-19 and Smoking\nof respiratory diseases among smokers. There is also growing\nevidence to support the WHO’s conclusion that smokers are at a\nhigher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms. Meanwhile, ongoing\nsmoking can aggravate the condition of COVID-19 patients and\nincrease the risk of death. Smokers’ social behaviors, such as\ngathering to smoke, can increase of COVID-19 transmission.\nAlthough the mechanism of nicotine’s eﬀect on ACE2 expression\nneeds further study, upregulation of ACE2 expression can\nincrease the susceptibility to and risk of COVID-19. Also,\nnicotine can increase pneumococcal and streptococcal antibody\nlevels to an extent. However, there is insuﬃcient evidence to\nindicate that there is any link between nicotine in tobacco and\nthe prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Smoking is not a\nmeasure to prevent COVID-19. Therefore, governments and\nhealth care providers should identify the importance of tobacco\ncontrol, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health\nmessages should increase publicity about tobacco hazards, the\nbeneﬁts of quitting, and provide strict, safe, and healthy tobacco\nmanagement in public and the workplace to encourage smokers\nto quit (Figure 2).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJX and RZ wrote this review.

Smoking has been reported as one of the factors that increases \nseverity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the effect \nof smoking on such medical outcomes is still controversial. This study \nconducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/\nMA) on the association between smoking and negative outcomes among \nCOVID-19 patients.\nMETHODS Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane \nLibrary, Science Direct, Google Scholar, were systematically searched from \nthe initiation of the database until 12 December 2020. All relevant studies \nabout smoking and COVID-19 were screened using a set of inclusion and \nexclusion criteria. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess the \nmethodological quality of eligible articles. Random meta-analyses were \nconducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval \n(CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot, Begg’s test and \nEgger’s test. \nRESULTS A total of 1248 studies were retrieved and reviewed. A total of \n40 studies were finally included for meta-analysis. Both current smoking \nand former smoking significantly increase the risk of disease severity \n(OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16–2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64–\n3.77, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. \nSimilarly, current smoking and former smoking also significantly increase \nthe risk of death (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12–1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; \n95% CI: 2.15–3.09, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of \nheterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias, which was tested \nby the funnel plot, Begg’s test and Egger’s test. \nCONCLUSIONS Smoking, even current smoking or former smoking, significantly \nincreases the risk of COVID-19 severity and death. Further causational \nstudies on this association and ascertianing the underlying mechanisms of \nthis relation is warranted.\nABBREVIATIONS COVID-19: coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease, OR: odds ratio, CI: confidence interval, WHO: World \nHealth Organization, GDP: gross domestic product, CVD: cardiovascular disease, MeSH: medical subject headings, ICU: \nintensive care unit, PaO2: partial pressure of arterial oxygen, FiO2: inspired oxygen fraction, NOS: Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.\nAFFILIATION\n1 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \nUniversity of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand\n2 Unit of Excellence on Clinical \nOutcomes Research and IntegratioN, \nSchool of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \nUniversity of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand\n3 Center of Health Outcomes Research \nand Therapeutic Safety, School of \nPharmaceutical Sciences, University of \nPhayao, Phayao, Thailand\n4 Division of Pharmaceutical Care, \nDepartment of Pharmacy, Phrae \nHospital, Phrae, Thailand\n5 Department of Global Health and \nDevelopment, London School of \nHygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, \nUnited Kingdom\n6 Unit of Excellence on Herbal \nMedicine, School of Pharmaceutical \nSciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, \nThailand\n7 Biofunctional Molecule Exploratory \nResearch Group, Biomedicine Research \nAdvancement Centre, School of \nPharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, \nBandar Sunway, Malaysia\n8 Novel Bacteria and Drug Discovery \nResearch Group, Microbiome and \nBioresource Research Strength, Jeffrey \nCheah School of Medicine and Health \nSciences, Monash University Malaysia, \nBandar Sunway, Malaysia\n \nCORRESPONDENCE TO\nSurasak Saokaew.

Following \nthe outbreak, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 \ndisease, COVID-19, was identified by the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) as the causative virus for \nthe pandemic in China and other parts of the world \nwith more than 30 million cases of infection and \n0.9 million deaths globally1. In addition, COVID-19 \npandemic caused poor mental health and quality \nof life, as reported. This pandemic is seen to be far \nfrom over and there is a continuing resurgence in \nmany countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused \npanic and anxiety because of the increasing number \nof COVID-19 cases worldwide2,3. Furthermore, \nCOVID-19 has had a significant global economic \nimpact and a huge burden on healthcare resources4. \nSmoking has been assumed to be associated with \nadverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence \nhas highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use \non lung health. It is also found to be detrimental \nto the immune system and its responsiveness to \ninfections, making smokers more vulnerable to \ninfectious diseases5. Smoking increases the risk and \nseverity of pulmonary infections because of damage \nto upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary \nimmune function6. It still remains controversial, \nhowever, if smoking results in severe symptoms and \ndeath among COVID-19 patients. Some previous \nstudies reported a significant association between \ncurrent smoking, former versus never smoking with \nCOVID-19 negative outcomes7–10. The differences \nbetween risk of severity and death between former \nand never smoker COVID-19 patients have not been \nshown11–13. Because of small sample sizes included \nin these previous studies and differing definitions \nof disease severity, existing systematic reviews and \nmeta-analyses found limited evidence suggesting that \nthe risk of COVID-19 infection maybe lower among \nsmokers compared to non-smokers, albeit from highly \nheterogeneous studies14–18. \nThere were a number of factors related to the \nseverity of COVID-19 and the mortality rate, \nincluding: older age (>65 years), comorbidities \n(e.g. hypertension, diabetes), organ dysfunction, \nlymphopenia, high cytokines, and weak immune \nresponses19–22. Especially, older age was associated \nwith a dramatically higher risk of severe COVID-19. \nFor example, the case fatality rate in three databases \nexceeded 1% around the age of 50–55 years, but was \n10% above 80–85 years (≥70 years in Italy)23. Males \naged >65 years, and smoking patients, face greater \nrisk of developing a severe or critical condition19. A \nprevious meta-analysis showed that all age groups \nhad significantly higher mortality compared to their \nimmediately younger age group, with the largest \nincrease in mortality risk observed in patients with \nages 60–69 compared to 50–59 years24. This fact \ncould be influenced by both the aging process and the \nhigh prevalence in frailty and comorbidities among \nthe older people, which contribute to a decrease in \ntheir functional capacity.\nGiven the unclear evidence about smoking in \nCOVID-19 infected patients aged ≤65 years, we \nconducted a comprehensive SR/MA to determine the \nassociation between smoking and disease severity in \nCOVID-19 infected patients by including all eligible \nstudies. Systematic searching of databases for available \nevidence and careful definition of disease severity was \nperformed for a rigorous summary of the conclusions.\nMETHODS\nProtocol and registration\nThe systematic review and meta-analysis were \nperformed in line with the Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses \n(PRISMA) statement 25. This research was \nregistered with PROSPERO (Registration Number \nCRD42020186638). Patients and the public were \nnot involved in this study. The systematic review \nand meta-analysis are exempt from ethics approval \nbecause data were collected and synthesized from \nprevious studies. The patient data are anonymized \nand available in the public domain. The authors \nfollowed applicable EQUATOR Network (https://\nwww.equator-network.org) guidelines during the \nconduct of research project.\nData sources and search strategy\nTo find relevant studies, scientific databases including \nEmbase, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar \nand Cochrane Library databases were systematically \nsearched from their inception to 12 December \n2020. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were used \nwhenever applicable. Bibliographic lists of related \nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2021;19(February):9\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/132411\n3\narticles were explored. The search strategy was \ncarried out with the following keywords: [tobacco OR \nsmok*] AND [covid OR coronavirus OR sars cov*] \nwith slight adjustments depending on the database. \nThere was no study design and language restriction. \nAdditionally, extra searches were performed in the \nreference lists of included studies to avoid missing \nany article (Supplementary file Table S1).\nStudy selection\nAll relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics \nand epidemiological information on smoking among \nCOVID-19 infected patients were included in the \nanalysis. All articles with any design (randomized \ncontrolled trials and observational studies) were \nincluded. Animal studies, reviews, commentaries, \neditorials, expert opinions, letters, conference meeting \nabstracts, case reports, case series, systematic reviews \nand meta-analyses were excluded. Studies with the \nsame participants that did not include effect estimates \nor had insufficient data to measure effect estimates \nwere also eliminated. Articles with explicit involvement \nwith the tobacco industry were excluded.\nOutcomes measures\nThe primary outcome was disease severity among \nCOVID-19 patients with a history of smoking. The \nsecondary outcome was death among COVID-19 \npatients with a history of smoking. The term ‘disease \nseverity’ includes clinical presentations based on \nphysical examinations and laboratory results, and \nother medical records, as diagnosed and described \nby physicians.\nDisease severity was defined by any of the following \ncriteria.\n1.   Patients who required ICU care26.\n2.\tSevere case as defined by the American Thoracic \nSociety guidelines for community-acquired \npneumonia22. \n3.\tSevere stage, if any of the following criteria existed: \na) shortness of breath, respiratory rate ≥30 times/\nmin; b) oxygen saturation <93% in resting state; \nc) PaO2/FiO2 ≤300 mmHg. CT imaging showed \nsignificant lesion progression >50% within 24 to \n48 h; d) respiratory failure requiring mechanical \nventilation; e) shock; and f) complications with \nother organ failure requiring ICU care27.\n4.\tSevere cases were patients needed supplemental \noxygen therapy28.\n5.\tSevere cases or patients with Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS) having PaO2/FiO2 \n≤300 mmHg29. \n6.\tSevere or critical patients as defined by the General \nOffice of National Health Commission of China, \nversion 5 (2020)30. \nIn cases where smoking status did not specify type of \nsmoking, it was taken to be current smoking.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nTwo investigators (AU and SK) independently \nscreened each title, abstract and full-text article \nfor potentially eligible studies. Discrepancies were \nresolved by discussions with a third investigator \n(SS). All extracted data were independently \nreviewed by two investigators (AU and SK). The \nfollowing information was extracted from each study: \nsetting, region, design, sample size, demographic \ncharacteristics of participants (age, sex), details of \nintervention/exposure (smoking status: current or \nformer smoker), and details of outcomes (disease \nseverity: severe or critical vs non-severe; death), \nand number of COVID-19 patients. The quality of \nindividual studies was appraised independently using \nthe Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)31. The NOS \nassigns a maximum of 9 points, with studies having a \ntotal score of ≥7 defined as high quality.\nStatistical analysis \nWe computed odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence \ninterval (CI) for each study using the number of \nsmokers (former or current) and never smoker with \npre-specified outcomes (severity and death). The pool \neffects were combined using random-effect model. \nHeterogeneity was investigated using Cochran’s Q \nstatistic and I2. Cochran’s Q statistic with an alpha \nvalue of 0.10 was chosen to designate heterogeneity \namongst trials for each analysis. Heterogeneity level \nwas assigned as: I2 >75%, 25–75%, and <25% to \nindicate high, moderate, and low level, respectively31. \nIn the case where heterogeneity existed, an attempt \nto explore possible sources of heterogeneity was \nmade. Publication bias was assessed using Begg’s \ntest, Egger’s test, and funnel plot32–34. A p<0.05 in \npublication bias tests was suggestive of publication \nbias. When publication bias was found, the trim-and-\nfill method was used35.\nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2021;19(February):9\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/132411\n4\nSensitivity and subgroup analysis\nTo appraise the robustness of our analysis, the \nsensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding \nwas used. Subgroup analyses were conducted by \nage differences between groups, current and former \nexposure to smoking, and quality of the studies. \nMeta-regression analysis was performed using \nrandom-effects meta-regression, metareg command in \nSTATA software36, adjusting for study characteristics \n(covariates) on pooled outcome.  The following \npotential moderator variables: age (>65 years), \nhypertension and diabetes mellitus were included for \nmeta-regression analysis. \nRESULTS\nSearch results and characteristics of studies \nincluded\nIn the initial search, 1248 articles were retrieved \nfrom all databases. Of these, 159 were eliminated \nthat were found to be duplicates. All articles \nwere screened using the title and abstract. After \nevaluating the abstracts, 937 studies were excluded \ndue to their data being irrelevant to our objective. \nAfter evaluating the full text, a total of 40 studies \nwith 369287 COVID-19 infected patients were \nincluded in the meta-analysis (Figure 1). The \nimportant characteristics and outcomes of the \nincluded articles were collated (Table 1). Of 40 \narticles, 19 were conducted in China21,22,27,29,30,37–50, \none in Kuwait26, one in Korea28, one in Mexico51, \none in Japan52, two in Spain53,54, three in Italy55–57, \nand twelve in the USA33,58–68. Most articles were \nretrospective studies. The mean age of the \npatients in the included studies was 54.10 years. \nNineteen studies defined outcomes as disease \nseverity22,27–30,37–39,42,43,46–50,58,60,62,63. Seventeen studies \ndefined outcomes as death21,33,40,44,45,51–57,59,65–68. Four \nstudies used both disease severity and death26,41,61,64. \nAll studies defined smoking status as current \nsmoker. Eleven studies included former smokers \nand current smokers22,33,43,44,47,57,58,61–63,67. \nQuality assessment\nNewcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess the \nmethodological quality of the 40 studies. Results \nshowed 12 studies receiving ≥7 stars26,44,49,55–57,59–62,64,68, \nand the remaining studies receiving <7 stars \n(Supplementary Table S2).\nSynthesis of results\nThe results in younger patients (≤65 years) showed \nthat both current smoking and former smoking \nsignificantly increase the risk of disease severity \n(OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16–2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; \n95% CI: 1.64–3.77, p<0.001; respectively) (Figure \n2A). Moreover, both current smoking and former \nsmoking also significantly increase the mortality \nrisk in COVID-19 patients (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12–\n1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.15–3.09; \np<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of \nheterogeneity (Figure 2B).\nSensitivity and subgroup analyses\nThese analyses were conducted for patients >65 \nyears. Results showed that both current smoking \nFigure 1. PRISMA flow diagram\nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc.

Dis. 2021;19(February):9\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/132411\n9\nDISCUSSION\nSummary of evidence\nBoth current and former smoking significantly \nincrease the risk of disease severity (OR=1.58; 95% \nCI: 1.16–2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64–\n3.77, p<0.001; respectively). Moreover, both current \nand former smoking also significantly increase the \nmortality risk among ≤65 years COVID-19 patients \n(OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12–1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; \n95% CI: 2.15–3.09, p<0.001; respectively).\nWe performed a comprehensive SR/MA to assess \nthe possible association between disease severity and \ndeath among smokers with COVID-19. According to \nour analysis, with the biggest sample size, smoking is a \nrisk factor for disease severity and death in COVID-19 \npatients. Current smokers have 1.58 times the odds \nof disease severity than never smokers. Remarkably, \nformer smokers have 2.48 times odds of disease \nseverity than never smokers. For death outcome, \ncurrent and former smoking also significantly increase \nthe risk of death by 1.35 and 2.58 times, respectively.\nThe most likely mechanism for the potential \nincrease in the risk might be associated with the \nangiotensin II conversion enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, \nwhich is in the mucosal epithelial cell and lung \nalveolar tissue and found to be related to infections \nwith COVID-19. The infection by the host virus \nattaching to the ACE2 receptors is probably a key step \nfor coronavirus infection. The ACE2 gene expression \nis heightened in both current and former smokers \ncompared to never smokers in a sample of patients \nwith lung adenocarcinoma, after adjusting for age, \ngender, and ethnicity5,6,69. This might be a reason \nwhy former smokers have higher odds of negative \noutcomes than never smokers. On the contrary, the \nfindings indicated that current smoking was less \nlikely to have negative outcomes compared with \nformer smoking. These might be due to the following \nreasons. First, the under-reporting of the current \nsmoking status. Most studies reported smoking \nhistory instead of current smoking, which might \ninclude former smokers and therefore underestimate \ncurrent smoking status among COVID-19 patients70. \nSecond, former smokers have longer exposure period \nor accompanying diseases such as asthma, COPD due \nto smoking18. As a result, former smoking showed \nhigher risk of negative outcomes compared with \ncurrent smoking.\nAlthough a previous systematic review  examined \nthe association between smoking and overall negative \noutcomes among COVID-19 patients, it was limited to \nonly Chinese patients12. Another systematic review did \nnot summarize the results as a meta-analysis13. One \nstudy demonstrated only the prevalence of smokers \namong patients hospitalized with COVID-1971 while \nin another study, the authors retrieved the studies \nfrom only one database and the definition of smoking \nwas unclear8. One focused on chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing smoking \nhistory17. One meta-analysis included just four \nselected studies of fair quality, which found that \ncurrent smokers were more likely to develop severe \nCOVID-19 illness compared to never smokers. But no \nsignificant difference was observed between former \nand never smokers. They also conducted a meta-\nanalysis using two studies deemed to be of fair quality. \nSo they found no significant difference between the \nrisk of death from COVID-19 either between current \nand never smokers, or former and never smokers11. \nFinally, all literature collected did not exclude  people \naged >65 years, which could be a disruptive variable \nto the study results.\nThe research question requires well-designed \npopulation-based studies that control for age \nand relevant underlying risk factors. To our best \nknowledge, this study is the first comprehensive meta-\nanalysis to assess the potential association between \nformer and current smokers and negative outcomes \nof COVID-19, with the biggest sample size. \nStrengths and limitations\nThis study has several strengths. First, we performed \na comprehensive search of major databases (Embase, \nPubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and \nCochrane), which is a standard method for conducting \na systematic review. Second, we employed a \ncomprehensive search strategy with no restrictions on \nlanguage and study design. Third, this meta-analysis \nadheres to the standard methodology of systematic \nreviews and meta-analyses as required by the \nPRISMA checklist. Fourth, our study covered updated \nevidence and was conducted using the appropriate \nstatistical methods for analysis. Finally, the robustness \nincluding sensitivity-analysis, subgroup-analysis and \nmeta-regression illustrated that the results remain \nunchanged. \nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2021;19(February):9\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/132411\n10\nThe study also has some limitations. First, all \nstudies included were observational studies which \nmight have residual confounders; however, this \nkind of study design reflects a real-world situation \nfor evaluating the association between smoking and \ndisease severity or death in COVID-19 patients. We \nalso used adjusted data from the included studies \nas much as possible. Nevertheless, there were only \nnon-adjusted data available in some studies. Thus, \nthe residual confounders might distort associations \nand conclusions. For example, obesity, diabetes, \nhypertension, asthma and age were reported to \nincrease the risk of severity of COVID-1972–74. We, \ntherefore, analyzed using meta-regression and found \nthat the conclusion remained the same. Second, we \nsearched five major databases, which might not have \ncovered all relevant studies. Nonetheless, after applying \nBegg’s test, Egger’s test, and a funnel plot, we found \nno evidence of publication bias. Third, the definitions \nof severity in each study  were slightly different and \nthis is a broad exploratory meta-analysis, which might \ndistort the association between smoking and outcome \nin COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the results should \nbe interpreted cautiously. However, from another \nperspective, the effects of smoking in our analysis were \nconsistent across studies, which may indicate high \ngeneralizability of the results to any circumstances. \nFourth, even key important factors that may potentially \naffect our findings were number of cigarettes smoked, \nnicotine addiction level, and the length of time after \nquitting until COVID-19 infection, which were not \nreported in the included studies.  Nevertheless, our \ncomprehensive sensitivity analysis showed a negative \nassociation of smoking on the outcomes.\nFurther research directions \nWell-designed longitudinal population-based studies \nare needed to address questions about the risk of \ninfection by SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of hospitalization \nwith COVID-19. Stronger evidence coming from \nsmoking status data that are systemically recorded and \nanalyzed among COVID-19 patients are needed. Some \nfactors such as number of cigarettes smoked, nicotine \naddiction level, and the length of time after quitting \nuntil COVID-19 infection should be collected. \nCONCLUSIONS\nSmoking is confirmed to be a risk factor for the \nnegative progression of COVID-19, particularly on \ndisease severity and death. Both current and former \nsmokers have higher odds of disease severity than \nnever smokers. Given the well-established harm \nassociated with tobacco use, smoking cessation is \nrecommended for all smokers and avoidance of \nsecondhand smoke by non-smokers.\nREFERENCES\n1.\t World Health Organization.

The \nSpecial Communication\nTobacco Smoking a Potential Risk Factor\nin Transmission of COVID-19 Infection\nNaseer Ahmed1, Afsheen Maqsood2, \nTariq Abduljabbar3, Fahim Vohra4\nABSTRACT\nCorona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory \nSyndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) group of viruses. To date, April 25, 2020, more than 2.4 million \nhumans are infected and more than a hundred thousand deaths have been reported from more than \n200 countries from COVID-19. There is no evidence-based treatment for the infection and prevention of \ntransmission using social distancing, isolation and hygiene measures is widely recommended. Tobacco \nsmoking is rampant in communities around the globe and the addiction to tobacco results in deaths of more \nthan 8 million individuals each year. As COVID-19 transmits through salivary droplets and causes severe lung \npneumonia, tobacco smokers are also at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to poor lung function, \ncross-infection and susceptible hygiene habits. Smoking tobacco (cigarette, e-cigarettes or waterpipe) \nproduces exhaled smoke, coughing or sneezing, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in the surroundings and \ncontaminating surfaces. Therefore, smoking tobacco is a possible mode of transmission for the virus for both \nactive and passive smokers. Smoking should be considered a risk factor for the disease transmission until \nfurther availability of evidence and measures to limit its direct and indirect effects should be implemented \nwithin the community.\nKEYWORDS: COVID-19 Infection, Risk Factor, Tobacco Smoking, Viral Transmission.\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2739\nHow to cite this:\nAhmed N, Maqsood A, Abduljabbar T, Vohra F.

In addition, \nsmoking tobacco (cigarette, e-cigarette, waterpipe) \ninvolves a frequently contact of saliva with hands \nand involved devices, which is a possible source \nof viral spread. Therefore, to prevent transmission, \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has published \nguidelines which must be practiced consistently.15 \nThese include washing of hands for 20 seconds at \nleast with water and soap along with supporting \nuse of alcohol-based sanitizers.15 To meticulously \npractice social distancing by maintaining 1-meter \ndistance between individuals.15 Avoid contact \nwith mouth, nose and eyes using hands. It is also \nrecommended to cough and sneeze in elbows \nfollowed by hand sanitization.15\n\t Tobacco smoking is rampant in communities and \nthe addiction to tobacco and its fashioned use is \nwidespread around the globe. The use of tobacco \nproducts kills almost 50% of its users. Tobacco kills in \nexcess of 8 million individuals each year. 5. 7 million \nmortalities are due to the direct tobacco use, while \n1.2 million due to the consequence of non-smokers \nbeing presented to tobacco smoke. Worldwide, \naround 80% (1.1 billion) tobacco smokers live in low \nincome-based countries where malnourishment is \nalso a serious threat to immunity levels.16 Tobacco \nsmokers are also at high risk of severe COVID-19 \ninfection due to compromised lung function, cross-\ninfection and susceptible hygiene habits. Smoking \npredisposes to severe lung diseases by impairing \nlung substance resulting in diseases like Chronic \nobstructive \npulmonary \ndisease, \nEmphysema, \nChronic Bronchitis and lung cancer. In addition \nto conventional cigarette smoking, e-cigarettes i.e. \nElectronic Nicotine Delivery Systems and JUice USB \nLighting (ENDS and JUUL), waterpipe and other \ntobacco smoking devices, use nicotine products. \nNicotine chemical derivatives are responsible for \neroding the protective lining of lungs, damage of \nblood vessels and irregular endothelial surface \nleading to blood clotting and lethal embolism. \nTherefore, in the presence of existing chronic lung \ndisease, the bronchial status of patients can quickly \nexacerbate with COVID-19 infection.17 Moreover, \nmortality rate among smokers with COVID-19 \ninfections is 25.8%.9 Therefore, strict cross-infection \nmeasures are difficult to implement in the presence \nof smoking. Smoking implies that fingers and \ncontaminated cigarettes shafts are in contact with \nlips which enhances the chance of transmission \nof COVID-19 from hand to mouth.13,16 As a result \nof smoking tobacco (cigarette, e-cigarettes or \nwaterpipe), due to exhaled smoke, coughing or \nsneezing, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 are \nproduced in abundance in the surroundings, \ncontaminating surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 survives in \naerosols and surfaces (plastic, paper and steel) \nfor several hours to days.16,18 Earlier reports have \nsuggested that SARS-CoV-2 can stay in air as \ndroplets and in micro-aerosols for up to three hours \nafter oral/nasal release.18,19 In  addition, common \nsurfaces used in smoking devices include paper, \nplastic, metals, on which the virus is found active \nfrom four hours up to 2-3 days.18 The contaminated \nsurfaces, surrounding air and aerosol due to \nsmoking of tobacco through multiple devices can \npassively infect non-smokers even if human \ndistancing is practiced. A similar phenomenon of \nviral infections and transmission has been reported \npreviously, which originated in rodents however \nhad a respiratory and smoking spread.20 In Finland, \na Puumala Hantavirus outbreak occurred, which \nwas associated to a greater extent with smoking \nhabits apart from other confounding factors.20 \nPak J Med Sci     May-2020    Vol. 36   No. COVID19-S4      www.pjms.org.pk     COVID19-S106\n\t Continuous \nglobal \nefforts \nhave \nincreased \nawareness of adverse effects of tobacco smoking \nand community health care programs at population \nlevel, \nhave \nsupported \nquitting \nof \nsmoking \nthroughout the years.21 However, in the midst of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, efforts for quitting of \nsmoking tobacco cannot be overemphasized. When \nisolation and hygiene measures are the most critical \nmanagement strategies to contain this COVID-19 \ncrisis, quitting and limiting tobacco smoking could \nbe one of the vital measures restricting the viral \nspread. Therefore, strict smoking etiquettes (Fig.1) \nneed to be adopted by general population and \nemphasized by the authorities. Smokers should be \nplaced in isolation and smoking only in designated \nareas with strict hygiene measures (cigarette holders \nor filters) and good ventilation should be permitted. \nSmoking should be a solitary habit without the \npresence of humans in close vicinity. Smoking \ndevices should be single use and no re-use or sharing \nof devices (conventional cigarette, e-cigarette \ndevices, waterpipe) be practiced.

Tobacco smoking with the use of \ncigarettes and other devices including electronic \ncigarettes, Vape, JUUL and water-pipes, threatens \nthe spread of salivary droplets in the form of \naerosols specially in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected \nasymptomatic smokers. Smoking in groups involves \nfrequent physical approximation and salivary \nfluid contact that makes it not only a risk factor \nfor COVID-19 but also to other infectious agents \nacquired from environment through respiration. In \naddition, transmission of infection due to sharing \nof some smoking devices including Waterpipe and \ne-cigarettes can be catastrophic. The occurrence of \npassive infection through smoke and aerosol from \nasymptomatic infected smokers is also conceivable. \nTherefore, smokers should be encouraged to quit \ntobacco use, especially in public and in groups. In \naddition, smoking areas must be well ventilated \nand should be for single individual use. Smokers \nshould use single use devices with strict smoking \netiquettes and safe hygiene measures. Government \nand authorities must provide rigid guidelines \napplied to public and work places to encourage \nquitting and banning of smoking. To provide \nsupportive data, future studies reporting smoker \nspecific COVID-19 infection findings related to \ndisease transmission, onset, pattern, progress, \nmanagement and recovery are recommended.\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful to \nthe Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud \nUniversity for funding through Vice Deanship \nof Scientific Research Chairs,  Research Chair for \nBiological Research in Dental Health.

Health care\nproviders, parents,\nschools, community-\nbased organizations, and\npolicymakers must help\nmake youth aware of the\nconnection between\nsmoking and vaping and\ncoronavirus disease.\nAs of June 2020, more than 2.1 million people have been\ninfected, and approximately 116,000 have died from Coronavirus\nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. [1], and the numbers continue\nto rise. Both cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use\ndamage the respiratory system [2e4], potentially increasing the\nrisk of experiencing COVID-19erelated symptoms, a positive\ndiagnosis and exacerbated health outcomes [5]. A meta-analysis\nof studies mostly in China found that smokers were at elevated\nrisk of COVID-19 progression compared with non-smokers [6].\nHospitalizations in the U.S. show that factors such as obesity, male\nsex, and older age are associated with COVID-19 [7]. Although\nyouth are at relatively lower risk of contracting COVID-19\ncompared with older adults, given the proportion of youth using\ne-cigarettes [8], youth e-cigarette and cigarette use may pose an\nimportant risk factor for COVID-19.\nCurrently, there are no U.S. population-based studies assess-\ning the relationship between cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use,\nConﬂicts of interest: None of the authors have any conﬂicting interests.\nDisclaimer: The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not\nnecessarily represent the ofﬁcial views of the National Institues of Health or the\nFood and Drug Administration.\nClinical trials registry site and number: Not applicable to this cross-sectional\nsurvey study.\n* Address correspondence to: Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, Ph.D., Stanford Uni-\nversity, 770 Welch Road, Suite 100, Palo Alto, CA 94304.\nE-mail address: bonnie.halpernfelsher@stanford.edu (B.

In the absence of information\non smoking and e-cigarette use history of youth diagnosed with\nCOVID-19, we conducted a population-level examination of\nwhether youth cigarette and/or e-cigarette use is associated with\nincreased likelihood of experiencing COVID-19erelated symp-\ntoms, being tested, and being diagnosed with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a national cross-sectional online survey of\nadolescents and young adults aged 13e24 years from May 6 to\n14, 2020 in the U.S., using Qualtrics [9], a leading enterprise\nsurvey technology platform. Participants were recruited from\nQualtrics' existing online panels using a survey Web link on\ngaming sites, social media, customer loyalty portals, and through\nwebsite intercept recruitment. Qualtrics panels are widely used\nto conduct social/behavioral research [10]. The online survey\ntook 15e20 minutes to complete. Through quota sampling, we\nrecruited e-cigarette ever-users (50.2%) and nonusers (49.8%);\nand adolescents (aged 13e17; 33.7%), young adults (aged 18e20\nyears; 41.6%), and adults (aged 21e24 years; 24.7%), while\nbalancing gender and race/ethnicity. This study was approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board at Stanford University.\nMultivariable logistic regression was conducted to assess\nassociations of ever-use and past 30-day use of cigarettes only,\ne-cigarettes only, and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes with\nCOVID-19 (self-reported symptoms, testing, and positive diag-\nnosis). The model used weights for age group; gender; lesbian,\ngay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning; race/ethnicity; and\ne-cigarette ever-use per U.S. population-based data; accounted\nfor\nclustering\nby\nregion\nand\nstate;\nand\ncontrolled\nfor\ndemographics, mother's education (as an indicator of socioeco-\nnomic status), body mass index (obesity as an underlying\ncondition) [11,12], complying with county shelter-in-place orders\nand state percentage of COVID-19epositive cases [13]. All mea-\nsures, percentages corresponding to weighted data in logistic\nregressions,\nand marginal\npopulation proportions used to\ncalculate weight\nare\nincluded\nin\nSupplementary\nMaterial.\nMissing values were treated as not missing completely at random\nfor Taylor series variance estimation. Statistical signiﬁcance was\nset at p < .05, and all tests were two-tailed.\nResults\nA total of 4,351 participants completed the online survey from\n50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and three union terri-\ntories. Table 1 provides weighted sample characteristics. Table 2\nshows factors associated with COVID-19erelated symptoms,\ngetting a COVID-19 test and a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.\nAs shown in Table 2, past 30-day dual-users were 4.7 times\nmore likely to experience COVID-19erelated symptoms (95%\nconﬁdence interval [CI]: 3.07e7.16). Experiencing such symp-\ntoms was nearly twice more likely among African American/\nblack, Hispanic, other/multiracial, underweight, and obese par-\nticipants; 1.8 times more likely among lesbian, gay, bisexual,\ntransgender, and questioning youth; and 1.6 times more likely\namong those not complying with shelter-in-place.\nEver-users of e-cigarettes only were 3.3 times (95% CI: 1.77e\n5.94), ever-dual-users were 3.6 times (95% CI: 1.96e6.54), and\never-users of cigarettes only were 3.9 times (95% CI: 1.43e10.86)\nmore likely to get COVID-19 tested. Past 30-day dual-users were\nnine times (95% CI: 5.43e15.47) and past 30-day e-cigarette only\nusers were 2.6 times (95% CI: 1.33e4.87) more likely to get\nCOVID-19 tested. Testing was 2e3 times more likely among male,\nAfrican American/black, other/multiracial, and those who were\nunderweight.\nEver-dual-users were seven times (95% CI: 1.98e24.55), ever-\nusers of e-cigarettes only were ﬁve times (95% CI: 1.82e13.96),\nand past 30-day dual-users were 6.8 times (95% CI: 2.40e19.55)\nmore likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19. Sociodemographic\nfactors associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis included\nbeing male, other/nonbinary gender, Hispanic, other/multiracial,\nand mother's completion of college- or graduate-level education.\nAs a possible underlying risk factor for low immunity to COVID-\n19 among youth, being underweight was associated with 2.5\ntimes greater risk of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis (95% CI: 1.05e\n6.20). In addition, being in a state with 11%e20% positive COVID-\n19 cases made a person nearly ﬁve times more likely to be\ndiagnosed positive (95% CI: 1.19e21.39).\nDiscussion\nOur population-based research provides timely evidence that\nyouth using e-cigarettes and dual-users of e-cigarettes and cig-\narettes are at greater risk of COVID-19. Given the predominance\nof e-cigarette use among U.S. youth, our investigation informs\npublic health concerns that the ongoing youth e-cigarette\nepidemic contributes to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Sur-\nprisingly, exclusive ever-use of combustible cigarettes was only\nassociated with COVID-19erelated testing, whereas both past\n30-day use and ever-use of e-cigarettes and dual use were\nassociated with COVID-19 testing and positive diagnosis.\nThere are a number of potential reasons why both dual use\nand e-cigarette use were associated with getting infected with\nCOVID-19. Heightened exposure to nicotine and other chemicals\nin e-cigarettes adversely affects lung function [14], with studies\nshowing that lung damage caused by e-cigarettes is comparable\nto combustible cigarettes [4,15,16]. COVID-19 spreads through\nrepeated touching of one’s hands to the mouth and face, which is\ncommon among cigarette and e-cigarette users [17]. Further-\nmore, sharing devices (although likely reduced while staying at\nhome) is also a common practice among youth e-cigarette\nusers [18].\nOur ﬁnding that some racial/ethnic groups, especially among\nAfrican American, Hispanic, and multirace youth, are at higher\nrisk for COVID-19 is supported by evidence of densely populated\nliving conditions that make social distancing challenging, greater\neconomic stress, and service-industry work environments where\nworking from home is less feasible and lower access to health\ncare contribute to underlying health issues [19e21]. Both obesity\nand underweight conditions were associated with COVID-19\noutcomes. Although at this point obesity is a more well-\nestablished risk factor for COVID-19 [7], being underweight\nalso impacts lung function [22e25], and therefore it is not sur-\nprising that it is also a risk factor for COVID-19. We also found\nthat other/nonbinary gender was associated with COVID-19\ntesting and diagnosis, a population that has received little\nattention so far.

Furthermore, we did not ask partici-\npants about hospitalization or severity of symptoms and\ncannot ascertain asymptomatic respondents. We recommend\nbiomarker-based studies to determine causality, as this study\nis based on self-report.\nConclusion\nOur ﬁndings from a national sample of adolescents and young\nadults show that e-cigarette use and dual use of e-cigarettes and\ncigarettes are signiﬁcant underlying risk factors for COVID-19\nthat has previously not been shown. The ﬁndings have direct\nimplications for health care providers to ask all youth and COVID-\n19einfected youth about cigarette and e-cigarette use history;\nfor parents, schools, and community-based organizations to\nguide youth to learn more about how e-cigarettes and dual use\naffect the respiratory and immune systems; for the Food and\nDrug Administration to effectively regulate e-cigarettes during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic; and for the development and dissem-\nination of youth-focused COVID-19 prevention messaging to\ninclude e-cigarette and dual use.\nFunding Sources\nThe research reported in this article was supported by the\nTaube Research Faculty Scholar Endowment to Bonnie Halpern-\nFelsher.

In our country, new \nmeasures to be taken were announced after the first case was seen on March 11, 2020. In this study, patients who admitted to \nthe smoking cessation clinic in 2018 and followed up by phone, regarding smoking cessation status in 2019 were questioned \nfor their smoking cessation status after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In this descriptive study, the patients who applied \nto the smoking cessation outpatient clinic in 2018 were questioned regarding their smoking cessation status after 1 year and \nafter the pandemic. It was investigated whether coronapandemia had an effect on smoking cessation. The data were evalu-\nated by using SPSS 22 software. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 357 individuals with a median \nof Fagerström score of 7.0 were included in the study. Seventy-one (19.9%) of the subjects used nicotine tape, 268 (75.1%) \nused varenicline, and 18 (5.0%) used both. When the success of those who quit smoking before pandemic and those who quit \nsmoking after pandemic were compared, a statistically significant relationship was found (p < 0.001). In our study, the rate \nof smoking cessation after 1 year was 23.7%, and the most common side effects were psychiatric complaints, whereas the \nrate of smoking cessation during the pandemic period was 31.1%. In order to increase the rate of smoking cessation, which \nis an important public health problem, more counseling should be provided, during the pandemic period.\nKeywords  COVİD 19 · Smoke · Smoking cessation\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic first started in Wuhan, China, in \nDecember 2019 and has affected the whole world. Initially, \nfear and stress began to increase due to the poorly under-\nstood symptoms and sudden deaths. Immediately after the \nfirst case was reported in Turkey on March 11, 2020, physi-\ncal contact between people was reduced to a minimum as per \nthe social distancing regulations introduced. Pertaining to \nthese regulations, schools were closed and remote working \nsystems where possible, were implemented. This new way \nof life, with most family members being constantly at home \nand the significant change in lifestyle, made this period more \ndifficult to manage.\nAccording to most smokers, smoking provides relief and \nis distressing. During this period, individuals started smok-\ning more cigarettes, in the pursuit of a sense of defense. \nHowever, during the pandemic spread, it has been reported \nthat COVID19 mortality rates were higher in those with \nCOPD and in smokers [1]. Some studies have shown that \nthe mortality was 14 times higher in smokers than in nor-\nmal individuals [2]. Thus, given that smoking is the leading \ncause of COPD together with the new reports stating that \nsmoking increases the risk of COVİD19 has drawn attention \nonce more towards quitting smoking.\nIn this study, the smoking statuses of patients admitted to \nthe smoking cessation clinic in 2018 and were followed up \nby phone in 2019 were reinvestigated during the COVID-19 \npandemic in 2020.\n *\t Burcu Kayhan Tetik \n\t\ndrburcukayhan@hotmail.com\n\t\nIşılay Gedik Tekinemre \n\t\nisilaygedik@hotmail.com\n\t\nServet Taş \n\t\nservettas@live.com\n1\t\nDepartment of Family Medicine, Inonu University Medical \nFaculty, Malatya, Turkey\n2\t\nElazığ Health Directorate, Elazığ, Turkey\n3\t\nInonu University Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey\n472\n\t\nJournal of Community Health (2021) 46:471–475\n1 3\nMethods\nIn this descriptive study, the records of 357 patients admitted \nto the Turgut Ozal Medical Center Family Medicine Smok-\ning Cessation Clinic between January 1 and December 31, \n2018 and registered on Tobacco Addiction Treatment Moni-\ntoring System (TUBATIS) were reviewed retrospectively. \nEach of the patients had been called by phone, for follow up, \nin 2019, 1 year after smoking cessation therapy started and \nquestions regarding smoking cessation and drug-related side \neffects had been asked. Due to the emergence of COVID-19 \npandemic, patients were called again and we investigated \nwhether the pandemic had an effect on their smoking ces-\nsation statuses.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe statistical analyses of the data were performed using \nSPSS 22.0 software. Categorical variables are presented as \nnumbers and percentages (%), and continuous variables are \npresented as median interquartile range (25–75 percentile \nvalues). The Chi-square test and McNemar test were used \nto compare categorical variables. The compliance of the \nparameters to normal distribution was evaluated with the \nKolmogorov–Smirnov test. The Mann–Whitney U test was \nused in independent groups to compare quantitative param-\neters that did not follow the normal distribution. A value of \np < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nResults\nThree hundred and fifty seven patients, 239 (66.9%) male \nand 118 (33.1%) female, were included in this study. The \naverage age of the participants was 39.5 ± 12.1 years (range \n19 to 73 years). The median Fagerstrom score was 7.0 \n(6.0–9.0). Seventy-one patients (19.9%) used a nicotine \npatch, 268 (75.1%) used varenicline, and 18 (5.0%) used \nboth (Table 1).\nWe found that 79 (22.1%) patients had at least one side \neffect of the treatment modality used, with psychiatric side \neffects being the most frequent. Other most common symp-\ntoms were nausea, sleep problems, other problems, skin \nlesions, genitourinary problems and cardiovascular prob-\nlems, respectively (Fig. 1).\nThe highest incidence of skin lesions and psychiatric \nproblemswere observed in patients who used nicotine patch \nand varenicline medication (p < 0.001, p = 0.007, respec-\ntively) (Table 2).\nWhen the smoking cessation status of the patients was \nexamined 1 year later, we found that 85 (23.8%) patients \nquitted smoking, 99 (27.7%) could not quit, 31 (8.7%) quit-\nted but started smoking again and 13 (3.6%) did not use any \nmedication and not quit smoke. One hundred and twenty \nnine (36.1%) of the registered patients could not be reached.\nThe patients were called by telephone after the pandemic \nwas announced, in order to find out whether the current \nCOVID-19 outbreak had an impact on their smoking status, \nin May 2020. We found that only 46 (12.8%) of 357 patients \ndid not start smoking again. We equally found that 165 \n(46.2%) of the patients who started smoking again or never \nquit before, quitted smoking with the fear of the COVID-19 \nepidemic, whereas 86 (24.1%) did not quit despite this pan-\ndemic. Sixty (16.8%) of the patients could not be reached.\nWhen the factors affecting the success of smoking cessa-\ntion were examined; no significant relationship was found \nbetween the cessation success and age, gender, medication, \nexposure to at least one side effect, and nicotine addiction \nscore (p > 0.05).\nThe comparison between those who quit smoking due to \nthe COVID-19 epidemic and those who did not yielded no \nstatistically significant difference in terms of age, gender and \nuse of medication (Table 3).\nTable 1   Age, gender, the drug used, and Fagerström scores of the \nparticipants\nIQR interquartilerange\nSayı\n%\nAge (median, IQR)\n39.0\n29.0–49.0\nGender\n Male\n239\n66.9\n Female\n118\n33.1\nDrug\n Nicotine patch\n71\n19.9\n Varenicline\n268\n75.1\n Nicotine patch + varenicline\n18\n5.0\nSkor (median, IQR)\n7.0\n6.0–9.0\nFig. 1   The most common side effects (n)\n473\nJournal of Community Health (2021) 46:471–475\t\n1 3\nWhen the success rate of those who quit smoking before \npandemic and those who quit smoking after pandemic was \ncompared, a statistically significant difference was found \n(p < 0.001) (Table 4).

In the literature, it has been observed that \nnumber of males admitted to the smoking cessation clinics \nis more than that of females [4–7]. Similarly, in this study, \n66.9% of the patients admitted to the outpatient clinic were \nmale. This finding indicates that the rate of smoking is still \nmuch higher in men. The average age of our patients was \n39.5 ± 12.1 years. The average age in this study is similar \nto that of other studies [5–9]. This result supports the sug-\ngestion that the habit of smoking begins around the age of \n17 years and the decision to quit is made around at the age \nof 40 years, as stated in the literature [10].\nIn previous studies on smoking cessation, the importance \nof investigating the smoking status of the patient, sensitiz-\ning them about smoking, and encouraging them to quit \nhave been emphasized [11, 12]. In this study, the rate of \nsmoking cessation at the time of follow up after 1 year was \n23.8%. When we look at the studies in the literature; Can \net al. reported that the 1-year success rate of smoking ces-\nsation in the outpatient clinic was 43.4% and they concluded \nthat this rate was independent of smoking duration, daily \nnumber of cigarettes, nicotine addiction level, and educa-\ntional level [13]. West et al. estimated the rate of smoking \ncessation at 19% with the help of intense motivational sup-\nport and the combination of medical treatment [12]. In the \nstudy of D’Angelo et al. 1-year smoking cessation rate was \nfound to be 23.7% [14]. In our study, unlike other studies, \nthe cessation rates after the COVID-19 pandemic were also \nexamined and statistically higher cessation rates were found. \nThis finding can be explained by the fact that it has been \nannounced that the course of coronavirus infection is more \nfatal in smokers.\nIn our study, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Depend-\nence [FTND] was used to determine the level of nicotine \naddiction. In many studies, it was stated that FTND scores \nwere effective in measuring the level of smoking dependence \nand evaluating the response to treatment [15, 16]. In the \npresent study, FTND scores were found to be 7 (range 6–9). \nIn the literature, FTND scores were found to be between 5.4 \nand 5.7, different from that of our study [9, 17]. However, in \nthe study conducted by Picakciefe et al., FTND scores were \nsimilar to ours [8]. This situation is thought to stem from \nregional differences.\nIn the smoking cessation treatment guidelines, it has been \nstated that the efficiency of nicotine replacement therapies \n[NRT] and pharmacological treatments in cigarette addiction \nare quite high [18, 19]. In our study, in addition to moti-\nvational support, the nicotine band was used as nicotine \nreplacement therapy, varenicline active drug as a pharmaco-\nlogical treatment and in some patients a combination therapy \nincluding both was used in our outpatient clinic. Since only \nvarenicline could be prescribed to patients free of charge at \nthe time of our study, we did not used bupropion. The nico-\ntine band was used in 19.9% of our patients, varenicline was \nused in 75.1%, and a combination of both was used in 5%. \nThe choice of treatment for the patients was determined by \nthe clinical conditions and addiction levels of the patients.\nIn this study, at least one side effect was observed in \n22.1% of the patients with the most common being psychi-\natric problems. This could be because most of our patients \nused varenicline, which has such side effects. It has been \nobserved that the frequency of psychiatric problems were \nhigher in patients using a combination therapy of nicotine \nband and varenicline. Patients treated with a combination \ntherapy of NRT and varenicline have higher dependency \nlevels and accordingly, feel more nicotine deficiency. In the \nstudy conducted by Demir et al., it was reported that stress \nnervousness, and difficulties of concentration were observed \nmost frequently due to nicotine deficiency and these com-\nplaints were more common in the group without NRT [20]. \nIn the present study, the second most common side effect, \nnausea, was most commonly seen in those using varenicline, \nwhile still being present in those using NRT and in those \nusing a combination therapy of both. Nausea is known to be \namong the side effects of varenicline and NRT.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent public health prob-\nlem affecting the whole world. The coronavirus, which espe-\ncially affects the respiratory tract, enters the body through \nthe upper respiratory tract mucosa via the nasal and oral \nroutes [21]. Smoking causes chronic inflammation in the \nupper respiratory tract mucosa, collects cytokines into this \narea, disrupts mucociliary activity, and causes overproduc-\ntion of mucus [22]. It has been reported that the current \nCOVID-19 disease is more fatal in smokers. In cigarette \nsmoking-related studies during this period, smoking status \nwas found to be the only associated factor in the logistic \nregression analysis regarding COVID-19 pneumonia [23]. \nLippi et al. found no relation was found between smok-\ning and COVID-19 pneumonia [24]. The reason for these \ncontradictory results may be due to the fact that the studies \nconducted were carried out in a short period of time during \nthe pandemic period and the sample size was small. The \ncontinuous hand to mouth contact during smoking activity \nis another important factor that increases the risk of con-\ntamination. Given these situations, smoking cessation has \ngained substantial importance in this period.\nIn the current study, the rate of smoking cessation was \n23.8% at the end of first year, while the rate of those who quit \nsmoking was 31.1% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Klem-\nperer et al. reported that 22.9% of their subjects reduced \nsmoking, 21.2% reduced electronic cigarette use, and 16.2% \nquit smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the fear \nof being harmed during this period [25]. On the other hand, \nin the study of Leventhal Adam et al., it was found that 30% \nof the patients increased the amount of cigarettes and 15% \nbecame less motivated for cessation; they attributed this situ-\nation to negative affection [26]. According to our findings, \n475\nJournal of Community Health (2021) 46:471–475\t\n1 3\nwe suggest that the motivation was strengthened by the feel-\ning of fear after the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the \nnegative affection. We suggest that the success of cessation \ncan be increased by informing the patients on the increased \nrisks with the COVID-19 pandemic during the meetings at \nthe smoking cessation interviews.\nConclusion\nIn our study, the rate of smoking cessation was 23.7% and \nthe most common adverse effect was psychiatric complaints \nin a 1-year follow up. Smoking cessation rates were found \nto increase up to 31.1% during the pandemic. We believe \nthat smoking cessation rates have increased due to the com-\nmon fear experienced during the pandemic. Considering that \nindividuals who smoke during this period may be affected \nby the COVID-19 pandemic more and in worse ways, it is \nnecessary to conduct cessation studies more decisively and \nthe interviews should include informing about the combined \nrisks with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Turan, O., & Mirici, A.

In a report of\n44,672 cases from China, a case fatality rate of 2.8% for males versus\nonly 1.7% for females was observed [2]. It has been hypothesized that\nthis may be due a higher prevalence of comorbidities among males, in\nparticular the rate of smoking, which is reported to be 52.1% in men\nand 2.7% among women in China [3]. However, decreased levels of\nangiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the reported host receptor of\nthe virus responsible of COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2), are observed in smokers [4,5]. In this\narticle, we aimed to investigate the association between active smoking\nand severity of COVID-19 illness.\nAn electronic search was conducted in Medline (PubMed interface),\nScopus and Web of Science, using the keywords “smoking” OR “cigar-\nette” AND “coronavirus 2019” OR “COVID-19” OR “2019-nCoV” OR\n“SARS-CoV-2”, between 2019 and present time (i.e., March 9, 2020),\nwithout language restriction. The title, abstract and full text of all\ndocuments captured with these search criteria were scrutinized, and\nthose reporting the rate of active smokers in COVID-19 patients with\nclinically validated definition of severe disease were included in this\nmeta-analysis. The reference list of the identified studies was also\nanalyzed (forward and backward citation tracking) for detecting other\npotentially eligible articles.\nA meta-analysis was then performed, with estimation of the odds\nratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in patients with or\nwithout severe forms of COVID-19. The statistical analysis was carried\nout using MetaXL, software Version 5.3 (EpiGear International Pty Ltd.,\nSunrise Beach, Australia). The study was carried out in accordance with\nthe declaration of Helsinki and with the term of local legislation.\nOverall, 27 documents could be initially identified based on our\nsearch criteria and from the reference lists, 22 of which were excluded\nafter title, abstract or full text reading, since they were review articles\n(n=4), commentaries or other editorial materials (n=2), they did not\ndeal with COVID-19 disease (n=11), or did not provided the rate of\nactive smokers in patients with or without severe disease (n=5).\nTherefore, 5 studies could finally be included in our meta-analysis,\nTable 1\nCharacteristics of the studies included.\nAuthors\nSetting\nSample\nsize\nOutcome\nSevere patients\nNon-severe patients\nn (%)\nAge (yrs)*\nWomen (%)\nn (%)\nAge (yrs)*\nWomen (%)\nGuan W et al., 2020\nChina\n1085\nAdmission\nto ICU, mechanical\nventilation, death.\n172 (16%)\n52\n(40–65)\n42%\n913\n(84%)\n45 (34–57)\n42%\nHuang C et al., 2020\nChina\n44\nICU Care\n13 (30%)\n49 (41–61)\n15%\n31 (70%)\n49 (41–58)\n32%\nLiu W et al., 2020\nChina\n78\nAdmission\nto ICU, mechanical\nventilation, death.\n11 (14%)\n66\n(51–70)\n36%\n67 (86%)\n37 (32–41)\n52%\nYang X et al., 2020\nChina\n50\nDeath\n32 (64%)\n65 (45–87)\n34%\n18 (36%)\n52 (26–77)\n30%\nZhang JJ et al., 2020\nChina\n142\nRespiratory distress/\ninsufficiency\n60 (42%)\n64 (25–87)\n43%\n82 (58%)\n52 (26–78)\n54%\n⁎ Median and interquartile range.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.03.014\nReceived 9 March 2020; Accepted 12 March 2020\nEuropean Journal of Internal Medicine 75 (2020) 107–108\nAvailable online 16 March 2020\n0953-6205/ © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

The essential characteristics of the five included studies\nare shown in Table 1, whilst the individual and pooled OR of smoking\nfor predicting severe COVID-19 is shown in Fig. 1. Overall, in only one\nstudy [8] active smoking was found to be a significant predictor of\nCOVID-19 severity, whilst in the other four studies the association was\nnot statistically significant. Despite a trend towards higher risk was\nappreciable, no significant association could neither be found between\nactive smoking and severity of COVID-19 when data of individual\nstudies were pooled (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.41–6.92; p=0.254). No sig-\nnificant association could also be found when the large study by Guan\net al.

As a respiratory illness, COVID-19 may \npose unique risks to cigarette smokers. This study used concept mapping, a mixed-method participatory \napproach, to identify impacts of COVID-19 on cigarette smokers. \nMethods: Cigarette smokers across the United States (U.S.) were recruited to complete this online, multi-step \nstudy. Of the 126 participants who were invited to participate in this study, 91 participants (mean age =\n40.9; SD = 11.3) completed at least one of the three study tasks (i.e., brainstorming, sorting, and rating). Par­\nticipants completed a brief demographic survey and brainstormed statements that completed a focus prompt: “A \nspecific way that Coronavirus/COVID-19 has impacted/affected my cigarette use, smoking behaviors, tobacco \npurchasing behaviors, and/or other tobacco-related behaviors is.” After duplicate statements were removed, \nparticipants sorted the final list of 87 statements by similarity of content and rated how true statements were \nfrom them (1-Definitely NOT true to 7-Definitely true). \nResults: Nine thematic clusters were identified: Smoking More, Smoking to Cope/Reduce Stress, Change in \nSmoking Behaviors Due to COVID-19, Concerns about Smoking and COVID-19 Risk, Social Impacts, Maintaining \nand Rationing Cigarette Supply, Impacts on Obtaining Cigarettes, Use of Other Tobacco Products/Drugs, and \nMinimal/No Impacts/Concerns of COVID-19. The highest rated cluster (i.e., most true) was the Smoking More \ncluster followed by the Concerns about Smoking and COVID-19 Risk cluster. The highest rated statement in the \nstudy was the statement “Smoking keeps me calm”. \nConclusions: Cigarette smokers may endure additional impacts of COVID-19, such as increased COVID-19 health \nburdens, stressors related to risk of exposure, social stigma and isolation, financial burdens, and increased \ntoxicant exposure from increased smoking frequency.   \n1. Introduction \nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World \nHealth Organization (World Health Organization, 2020) and subse­\nquently, residents of the United States (U.S.), as well as other countries, \nexperienced a dramatic change in their day-to-day lifestyles. Some states \nentered periods of “lockdown” (that is, staying home and limiting travel \noutside the home to only essential activities) for periods of time in 2020 \nand 2021 in an effort to decrease the spread of COVID-19. Additional \nprecautions have included encouraging or mandating people to distance \nthemselves from others or wear masks. Even with these measures, as of \nSeptember 2021, nearly 700,000 people died in the U.S. as a result of the \nCOVID-19 (CDC, 2021). \nResearch has begun to identify risk factors for COVID-19-related \nmorbidity and mortality, including cigarette smoking. Specifically, \nsmoking may increase transmission (Ahmed et al., 2020) and is associ­\nated with the severity of COVID-19 infection e.g. (Gupta et al., 2020; \nHaddad et al., 2021). Surprisingly, some research studies have reported \nthat cigarette smokers are at reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (Simons \net al., 2021; Paleiron et al., 2021). However, this research has been \ncriticized for selection bias and may not be generalizable, thus the \nclinical significance of these findings are unclear (Li Volti et al., 2020). \n* Correspondence to: Center for the Study of Tobacco Products, Department of Psychology, College of Humanities and Sciences, Virginia Commonwealth Uni­\nversity, 100 West Franklin Street, Suite 200, Richmond, VA 23220, USA. \nE-mail address: abbrelan@vcu.edu (A.B.

Multiple studies observed in­\ncreases, decreases, and no changes in smoking behaviors. For example, \nin a sample of Dutch smokers, 67.7% reported no change in number of \ncigarettes they smoked while 18.5% reported decreasing and 13.8% \nreported increasing the number of cigarettes they smoked (Elling et al., \n2020). In a study of older U.S. adults recruited from a tobacco and health \ntrial found that 51.7% reported no change to their smoking behavior, \nwhile 20.7% reported reducing the amount they smoked and 27.6% \nreported increasing the amount they smoked (Cordon et al., 2021). \nOther studies have found similar patterns of increases and decreases in \ncigarette smoking within samples of Dutch, Belgian, and Australian \nsmokers (Stanton et al., 2020; Vanderbruggen et al., 2020; Bommele \net al., 2020). Several studies found that smokers reported smoking more; \nfor example, a study in Poland reported that 45.2% of the smokers \nindicated smoking more during a lockdown period (Sidor and Rzymski, \n2020). A study of smokers from New Zealand found that 45% of daily \nsmokers reported smoking more, while 16% reported smoking less, and \n39% reported no changes (Gendall et al., 2021). Similarly, a study of \nItalian smokers found that 30% of smokers were smoking more (an \naverage of 5.6 cigarettes per day [CPD] more) and 18% reported \nsmoking less (an average of 4.1 CPD less)(Ferrante and Fearnside, \n2020). The majority of a survey sample of U.S. cigarette smokers, 68.9%, \nreported smoking cigarettes less frequently in the past 28 days when \nsurveyed in April/May 2020 (Gold et al., 2021). The changes in smoking \npatterns observed in these studies vary dramatically within and across \ndifferent samples suggesting great variability in smoking behaviors in \nresponse to COVID-19. \nNumerous studies have investigated the impacts of COVID-19 on \nmotivations to quit smoking and quit attempts (Chertok, 2020; Gold \net al., 2021; Klemperer et al., 2020; Shepherd et al., 2021). An online \nsurvey of U.S. smokers revealed that fear predicted motivations to quit \nand reductions in smoking behavior (Gold et al., 2021). In a study of \nDutch smokers who were motivated to quit, 33.8% reported being more \nmotivated to quit because of COVID-19, while 66.2% reported they were \nnot more motivated to quit due to COVID-19 (Elling et al., 2020). \nFurthermore, motivations to quit smoking were positively associated \nwith beliefs that COVID-19 is a serious risk to health, smokers are at an \nelevated risk of transmitting COVID-19, and having more severe com­\nplications (Elling et al., 2020). In a sample of U.S. smokers from Ohio, \nthose who were more motivated to quit smoking perceived a higher risk \nof infection of COVID-19 (Chertok, 2020). Conversely, in a U.S. sample \nof cigarette smokers, worry about COVID-19 was positively associated \nwith coping motives to smoke, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, \nand negative smoking abstinence symptom expectancies. This suggests \nthat worry related to COVID-19 may increase the likelihood a smoker \ncontinues to smoke cigarettes (Shepherd et al., 2021). This study may \nhelp to explain why in a sample of older U.S. adult smokers, 51.7% re­\nported no changes in cigarette consumption and 55.2% reported no \nmotivations to quit despite 64.3% of the sample reporting extreme \nconcern with COVID-19 (Cordon et al., 2021). While fear about \nCOVID-19 may have motivated some smokers to reduce or quit smoking, \nit may have exacerbate smoking behaviors in others. Taken together, \ncurrent research suggests the heterogeneity of the impacts of COVID-19 \non smoking behaviors and that more research is needed to understand \nthe extent to which COVID-19 affects smokers’ behaviors. \nGiven the continued impact of COVID-19 on many smokers’ daily \nlives, a broader understanding of factors that may impact smokers’ be­\nhaviors may be helpful to prevent negative health impacts associated \nwith smoking and COVID-19. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to \nexamine the effects of COVID-19 on cigarette smokers’ tobacco use, \npurchasing behaviors, and other related behaviors. This study is an \ninitial attempt to explore the universe of possible cigarette smoking \nattitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that were impacted due to COVID-19. \nWhile we expected to see reports of both increases and decreases in \nsmoking patterns, we did not have specific hypotheses as the approach \nused in the current study is intended to be exploratory. Specifically, \nconcept mapping (CM) is an integrative mixed methods approach that \nuses multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses to \nidentify latent constructs and was used in the current study to organize \nand describe the impacts of COVID-19 on cigarette smokers’ behaviors. \nThis process includes generation of statements through a brainstorming \ntask and through a sorting and rating task to create a concept “map” of \nthematic clusters of statements. CM is well-suited for identifying new \ndomains of smoking behaviors and attitudes because the analyses yield a \nvisual representation of thematic clusters, similar to an exploratory \nfactor analysis, but do not require large sample sizes. This method has \nalso been used to describe the impact of COVID-19 on electronic ciga­\nrette users (Soule et al., 2020). \n2. Methods \n2.1. Participants and procedures \nDuring May through August of 2020, adult current cigarette smokers \nwere recruited through posting advertisements on Craigslist on a city \nspecific board in a total of 12 states, 3 from each region (Northeast, \nMidwest, South, and West/Pacific; as in Soule et al., 2018). This selec­\ntion process allows for a more generalizable sample of individuals across \nthe United States. Individuals who were interested in the study con­\ntacted study staff via email and were asked to complete a brief online \nscreening questionnaire. Participants who reported being over 18 years \nof age, had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and currently \nsmoked at least five cigarettes per day (n = 126) were invited to the \nstudy website (The Concept Systems® Global MAX©) to participate. Of \nthe 126 individuals that were invited to participate in the study, 91 \nlogged on to the study website and completed at least some of the \nparticipant questions related to demographics, cigarette use, and other \ntobacco product use. Participants were then asked to complete the \nbrainstorming first, and then were invited back after statement reduc­\ntion to complete sorting, and rating tasks (described below). Of the 91 \nparticipants that completed any of the three tasks, 33 completed all \nthree tasks, 25 completed just brainstorming, 1 completed brain­\nstorming and sorting, 17 completed brainstorming and rating, 11 \ncompleted sorting and rating, and 4 completed the rating task only. \nSome participants did not complete the sorting task or did not follow \ntask instructions. Participants were paid in the form of Amazon gift \ncards; they received $10 for completing brainstorming, $25 for sorting, \nand $10 for rating. This study was approved by the Virginia Common­\nwealth University Institutional Review Board. \n2.2. Brainstorming \nFollowing the brief participant questions and demographic ques­\ntionnaire, participants were instructed to provide statements completing \nthe prompt: “A specific way that Coronavirus/COVID-19 has impacted/ \naffected my cigarette use, smoking behaviors, tobacco purchasing behaviors, \nand other tobacco related behavior is.”. Participants were encouraged to \nprovide multiple statements that completed the prompt. Statements \nwere generated anonymously and participants were able to see previous \nparticipants’ responses and were instructed to review previous state­\nments to prevent duplicating statements. This process allows for inter­\nactive brainstorming that results in a greater quantity of ideas (Dennis \nand Williams, 2003; DeRosa, et al., 2007) and more unique ideas \n(Dugosh et al., 2000; Dugosh and Paulus, 2005). Researchers monitored \nand reviewed statements until content saturation was reached (i.e., \nenrolling additional participants in the brainstorming task no longer \nyielded unique content). A total of 76 participants completed the \nbrainstorming task, and participants generated 329 statements. \nThree reviewers examined the statement list independently to \nremove redundant content or content unrelated to the focus prompt. \nS.F. Maloney et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nDrug and Alcohol Dependence 229 (2021) 109144\n3\nReviewers discussed the statements in a group discussion and statements \nwere candidates for removal if two or three of the reviewers identified \nindependently that statements were redundant with other statements or \ndid not relate to the focus prompt. For duplicative statements, reviewers \nretained one statement that best captured the main idea of the redun­\ndant statements based on group discussion and consensus. Statements \nwere reviewed for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors that \naffected readability, but major revisions were avoided. This review \nresulted in a final list of 87 statements. \n2.3. Sorting \nParticipants who completed brainstorming were invited back to the \nstudy website to complete sorting and rating. Due to attrition, additional \neligible participants were contacted to complete only sorting and rating. \nOf those invited, 45 completed the sorting activity. A pooled analysis of \nconcept mapping studies demonstrates that these sample sizes are suf­\nficient for the multidimensional scaling analysis, with additional par­\nticipants no longer improving model fit (Rosas and Kane, 2012). For the \nsorting task, participants organized all 87 statements into piles via ‘drag \nand drop’ table top format with similar themes/content on their com­\nputers using the following instructions: “1) Do not create categories \naccording to priority, or value, such as ’important’, ’doesn’t apply to \nme’, or ’true’/’false’. 2) Do not create categories such as ’miscellaneous’ \nor ‘other’ that group together dissimilar statements. 3) Every statement \nneeds to be sorted into a pile.” After being reviewed by the research staff, \na total of 45 participant statement sorting arrangements were approved. \n2.4. Rating \nFor rating, participants rated each statement on a scale of 1 (Defi­\nnitely NOT true) to 7 (Definitely True) based on the prompt, “For me, this \nis a specific way that COVID-19/Coronavirus has impacted/affected my \ncigarette use, smoking behaviors, tobacco purchasing behaviors, and other \ntobacco related behaviors.” A total of 65 participants completed the rating \ntask. \n2.5. Representation and data analysis \nUsing participant sorting data and the CM system software, an 87 ×\n87 matrix of similarities was created. Each cell within the matrix rep­\nresented the total number of times two statements were sorted into the \nsame pile by participants. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, an \nalgorithm assigned each statement a coordinate (x,y) in two- \ndimensional space with each statement being represented by a point \non a map (“point map”; Kruskal and Wish, 1978). Points on the map that \nwere closer to each other represented statements that were sorted \ntogether more often by participants, whereas points on the map that \nwere further apart represented statements that were sorted together less \noften or not at all by participants. The stress value (0.28) of the current \nmodel, which indicates the fit of the multidimensional scaling analysis, \nfell within the range of stress values reported in previous research (Rosas \nand Kane, 2012), indicating good fit and congruence between the pro­\ncessed data and the raw data (Davison, 1983; Kruskal, 1964). \nUsing an algorithm (Ward, 1963) that identified non-overlapping \n“clusters” of statements by identifying groups of statements that \nlimited the distance from points to the centroid of identified clusters, a \nhierarchical cluster analysis generated multiple cluster maps. Specif­\nically, CM software first identified quantitatively a two-cluster model, \nand subsequent models were built by separating one cluster from the \nprevious model into two clusters into two clusters similarly by identi­\nfying clusters by limiting the distance between points and the centroid of \nthe cluster. The goal of this hierarchical cluster analysis is to identify the \nmost parsimonious model (i.e., fewest clusters preferred) in which each \ncluster only relates to a single theme. The research team continued the \nhierarchical cluster analysis process and through group discussion \nexamined if models met interpretability (i.e., each cluster described a \nsingle theme) and parsimony criteria. The research team determined \nthat the best fitting model was achieved with 9 clusters (see Fig. 1). \nMean cluster ratings were calculated by taking the average of ratings \nfrom all participants for all statements within a single cluster. \n3. Results \nParticipant characteristics of the 91 participants that completed at \nleast one of the three study tasks (i.e., brainstorming, sorting, and rat­\ning) are displayed in Table 1. Nine thematic clusters of statements were \nidentified (see Fig. 1). A summary of the clusters is presented below and \na complete list of clusters and statements including mean cluster and \nstatement ratings are displayed in Table 2. \n3.1. Smoking more \nThe highest rated cluster was the Smoking More cluster. This cluster \nhad 16 statements and had an average rating of statements within this \ncluster (mean cluster rating) of 3.91 (SD = 0.78). Statements in this \ncluster related to participants increasing their smoking frequency. One \nof the highest rated statements in this cluster was the statement was “I \nhave increased my smoking since COVID-19/Coronavirus” (M = 4.95). \nThis statement and others such as the statement “I cannot seem to \ncontrol my tobacco use since COVID-19/Coronavirus” (M = 3.66) \nindicate participants’ general increases in smoking during the COVID-19 \npandemic. Other statements such as “I smoke more for something to do” \n(M = 4.68), “I smoke more because I have less to do” (M = 4.44), and “I \nsmoke several cigarettes in a row/chain-smoke due to boredom” \n(M = 4.37) indicate smoking has increased as a way to pass the time or \nentertain oneself during the COVID-19 pandemic. Statements in this \ncluster such as “I smoke more cigarettes now being off work due to \nCOVID-19/Coronavirus” (M = 4.55), “I smoke more because I am \nworking from home” (M = 3.86), and “I smoke more because it is more \nconvenient now” (M = 3.55) indicate that smoking has increased due to \nfeasibility of smoking more often due to location and schedule. Tied for \nthe highest rated statement in this cluster (M = 4.95) was the statement \n“I smoke more when I am alone”, suggesting that social isolation and a \nreduction in social activities has also led to an increase in smoking. \n3.2. Concerns about smoking and COVID-19 risk \nThe second highest rated cluster was the Concerns about Smoking and \nCOVID-19 Risk that had a total of 12 statements and a mean cluster \nrating of 3.73 (SD = 0.86). The statements in this cluster included \nthemes of being concerned about the risk of COVID-19 and preventing \ncontracting COVID-19, being more susceptible to COVID-19, or having \nworse health outcomes due to smoking. The highest rated statement in \nthis cluster was the statement “I believe if I were to get COVID-19/ \nCoronavirus, my smoking would make it worse for me” (M = 4.89). \nSimilar statements included “I worry more about my smoking and its \nimpact on my health” (M = 4.48) and “I am scared that smoking might \nincrease my chances of getting COVID-19/Coronavirus” (M = 3.17). \nThis cluster also includes statements such as “I no longer socially gather \nand smoke” (M = 4.85), “I have to be more careful and wash my hands \nafter each time I go to smoke” (M = 4.60), and “I sterilize the outside of \nmy cigarette packages” (M = 2.55). Some of the statements in this \ncluster indicate being uncomfortable smoking in public or due to health \nmandates such as masks requirements and social distancing such as “I \nam less likely to smoke in public due to wearing a mask” (M = 3.69), “I \nfeel uncomfortable smoking in public” (M = 3.14) and “I am more aware \nof the people I smoke around” (M = 4.50). \n3.3.

These \nstatements included themes of feeling stressed about quitting due to \nCOVID-19 and changes to smoking routines and behaviors. The highest \nrated statement in this cluster was the statement “I know I need to quit, \nbut I am not ready to quit right now” (M = 5.11). This statement and the \nstatement “I feel more stress about quitting smoking due to health rea­\nsons because of COVID-19/Coronavirus” (M = 4.00) suggest that \nCOVID-19 may have brought more attention to the impacts of smoking \non one’s health. Other statements in this cluster included smoking \nbehavior changes such as “I am more likely to smoke a cigarette early \nwhen I am approaching a public area” (M = 4.05) and “I now smoke on \nthe balcony/out the window” (M = 2.97), suggesting that participants \nhave changed where they smoke due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n3.4. Smoking to cope/reduce stress \nThe Smoking to Cope/Reduce Stress cluster had a total of 14 statements \nand had a mean cluster rating of 3.63 (SD = 0.83). This cluster con­\ntained statements that indicated participants smoked in order to deal \nwith negative emotions/feelings from the impacts of COVID-19 or to \nelicit positive emotions/feelings during COVID-19. The highest rated \nstatement in the study was in this cluster and that statement was \n“Smoking keeps me calm” (M = 5.66). Other statements in this cluster \nincluded “I smoke because I feel sad/depressed” (M = 4.08), “I smoke \nmore cigarettes now because COVID-19/Coronavirus gives me stress/ \nanxiety” (M = 3.97), and “I smoke because I feel isolated” (M = 3.69). \nAdditional statements in this cluster indicate that smoking was also used \nto change participants’ physical environment, as illustrated by the \nstatements “I go outside to smoke for a change of scenery” (M = 4.25) \nand “I smoke more at work to get out of the office and take a mental \nbreak from stress” (M = 2.92). This cluster also contained the statement \n“I am smoking when I drink, which is more frequently” (M = 3.22), \nwhich suggests that the use of other substances may also have led to \nincreased cigarette use during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n3.5. Social impacts \nThe Social Impacts cluster had a total of eight statements and a mean \ncluster rating of 3.32 (SD = 1.18). Statements in this cluster relate to \nsocial smoking behaviors. The highest rated statement in this cluster was \n“I share fewer cigarettes since I do not come into contact with as many \npeople” (M = 5.15). Another highly rated statement in this cluster also \npertained to sharing cigarettes: “I do not share cigarettes with anyone \nanymore” (M = 4.57). Other statements in this cluster related to \nsmoking less due to social restrictions, such as “I smoke less since I \ncannot smoke around my family, and they are home most of the day” \n(M = 2.22). Other statements in this cluster include “I am more mind­\nful/aware of my smoking habits” (M = 4.42), “I try quitting with more \nfrequency now” (M = 2.25), and “I am less interested in smoking now” \n(M = 2.23). \nM\nMinim\non\naintaining an\nCigarette\nCluster Leg\n  Layer    Va\n      1        2.\n      2        2.\n      3        3.\n      4        3.\n      5        3.\nal/No Impact\nn Smoking \nUse of Othe\nProducts/Dr\nnd Rationing\ne Supply\ngend\nalue \n69 to 2.93 \n93 to 3.18 \n18 to 3.42 \n42 to 3.67 \n67 to 3.91 \nts \ner Tobacco \nrugs \ng\nImpa\nSmok\nRed\nacts on Obta\nCigarettes\nking to Cope\nduce Stress\naining \nS\ne/ \nocial Impact\nC\nB\nSmoking Mo\nts\nhange in Sm\nBehaviors due\nCo\nSm\nCO\nore\nmoking \ne to COVID-\noncerns abou\nmoking and \nOVID-19 Risk\nut \nk\nFig. 1.

Number points on the map that are within a closer distance to each other represent statements that were grouped more often together and had similar \ncontent, whereas statements that are further apart represent statements that were not grouped together often and had dissimilar content. Layers represent mean \nratings of statements from the rating task. Greater number of layers represent higher mean ratings within each cluster. Mean ratings with 1 layer range from 2.69 to \n2.93, 2 layers range from 2.93 to 3.18, 3 layers range from 3.18 to 3.42, 4 layers range from 3.42 to 3.67, and 5 layers range from 3.67 to 3.91. \nS.F.

Minimal/no impacts on smoking behaviors \nThe Minimal/No Impacts on Smoking Behaviors cluster had a total of \nsix statements and had a mean cluster rating of 3.24 (SD = 0.97). \nStatements in this cluster generally related to having specific feelings \nduring COVID-19 but ones that did not result in behavior changes. The \nhighest rated statement in this cluster was the statement “Even though \nCOVID-19/Coronavirus worries me, my addiction will not let me stop” \n(M = 5.13). Other statements in this cluster include “COVID-19/Coro­\nnavirus did not impact my cigarette use, smoking behaviors, or tobacco \npurchases” (M = 3.19) and “With extra time for self-reflection, I am less \nconcerned about my smoking habit” (M = 3.15). One statement in this \ncluster that was particularly concerning and highlights the need for \nbetter communication of health information and research finding to the \npublic is the statement “I have read that smokers get sick less with \nCOVID-19/Coronavirus, so I do not feel guilty/worried anymore about \nmy smoking” (M = 2.69). \n3.7. Maintaining and rationing cigarette supply \nThe Maintaining and Rationing Cigarette Supply cluster included 13 \nstatements and had a mean cluster rating of 2.95 (SD = 0.98). State­\nments in this cluster related to cigarette purchasing and rationing be­\nhaviors during COVID-19. The highest rated statement in this cluster \nwas the statement “My income is now limited but I am still purchasing \ntobacco” (M = 4.94). This statement, and the statement “I spend what I \nhave on tobacco” (M = 3.55) suggest that although the COVID-19 \npandemic impacted participants’ income, purchasing cigarettes \nremained a priority for participants. The statement “I buy more ciga­\nrettes at a time” (M = 4.55) also relates to participants ensuring a supply \nof cigarettes during the COVID-19 quarantine. Other statements in this \ncluster suggested that participants were rationing or finding ways to \nextend their cigarettes to last longer; these statements included “I have \nstarted rationing my cigarettes” (M = 2.89), “I sometimes save half- \nsmoked cigarettes to smoke/make another cigarette out of them later” \n(M = 4.05), “I have started hoarding cigarettes/tobacco products” (M =\n2.66), and “I count the cigarettes I smoke to minimize use” (M = 2.51). \n3.8. Impacts on obtaining cigarettes \nThe Impacts on Obtaining Cigarettes cluster had a total of five state­\nments and a mean cluster rating of 2.83 (SD = 0.87). This cluster had \nstatements that related to impacts and concerns regarding cigarette \nsupply and statements about smoking less. The highest rated statement \nin this cluster was the statement “I purchased cigarettes and tobacco \nproducts I needed ahead of the stay at home orders” (M = 4.18). Other \nstatements in this cluster included “I worry about running out of ciga­\nrettes due to restricted store hours” (M = 3.47) and “I spend more \nmoney on cigarettes because I cannot share cigarettes with others” \n(M = 2.54). This cluster also included statements that related to smok­\ning less such as “I smoke less because I am outdoors less” (M = 2.12) and \n“I smoke less” (M = 1.85). \n3.9. Use of other tobacco products/drugs \nFinally, the Use of Other Tobacco Products/Drugs cluster had a total of \nsix statements and was the lowest rated cluster with a mean cluster \nrating of 2.69 (SD = 0.77). Statements in this cluster related to using \nother tobacco products in addition to or in substitution of cigarettes. The \nhighest rated statement in this cluster was “I will buy any related/similar \nbrand of cigarettes if my usual is not available” (M = 4.26). Other \nstatements in this cluster included “I smoke other tobacco products now” \n(M = 2.69), “I use electronic cigarette/vape more” (M = 2.66), and “I \nTable 1 \nSample demographics and cigarette and tobacco use characteristics.  \nCharacteristic \nN or (M, SD) \n% \nAge \n(40.9, 11.3)   \nGender    \nFemale \n41  \n45.1 \nMale \n50  \n54.9 \nEthnicity    \nHispanic/Latino(a) \n9  \n9.9 \nNot Hispanic/Latino(a) \n82  \n90.1 \nRace    \nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native \n4  \n4.4 \nAsian \n2  \n2.2 \nBlack/African American \n13  \n14.3 \nNative Hawaiian/Pacific Islander \n1  \n1.1 \nWhite/European American \n60  \n65.9 \nMore than one race \n10  \n11.0 \nEducation    \nHigh school education \n1  \n1.1 \nHigh school graduate \n13  \n14.3 \nGED \n7  \n7.7 \nSome college (< 1 year) \n9  \n9.9 \nSome college (> 1 year) \n17  \n18.7 \nAssociates degree \n14  \n15.4 \nBachelor’s degree \n22  \n24.2 \nMaster’s degree \n8  \n8.8 \nCurrent cigarette smoking frequency    \nEvery day \n89  \n97.8 \nSome days \n2  \n2.2 \nCigarettes smoked per day \n(13.1, 7.6)   \n10 or less \n43  \n47.3 \n11–20 \n34  \n37.4 \n21–30 \n8  \n8.8 \n31 or more \n5  \n5.5 \nDuration smoking current number of cigarettes (in years) \n(14.8, 12.1)   \nDuration smoking on a regular basis (in years) \n(18.2, 12.2)   \nCigarette flavor    \nMenthol \n33  \n36.3 \nNon-Menthol \n53  \n58.2 \nNo Usual Brand \n5  \n5.5 \nFTND Score \n(3.6, 1.4)   \nAge of first tobacco use \n(16.3, 6.0)   \nFirst tobacco product use    \nCigarette \n79  \n86.8 \nCigar \n6  \n6.6 \nCigarillo/Little Cigar \n2  \n2.2 \nSmokeless Tobacco \n3  \n3.3 \nEver tried to quit smoking    \nNo \n18  \n20.0 \nYes \n73  \n80.2 \nCurrent e-cigarette use    \nEveryday \n12  \n13.2 \nSomedays \n37  \n40.7 \nNot at all \n42  \n46.2 \nE-cigarette use frequency    \nI did not use an e-cigarette/vaping device \n44  \n48.9 \nAt least once per day \n12  \n13.2 \nEvery once in a while throughout the day \n20  \n22.0 \nFairly frequently throughout the day \n11  \n12.1 \nAlmost always throughout most of the day \n4  \n4.4 \nPast 30-day regular/large cigar use    \nNo \n76  \n83.5 \nYes \n14  \n15.4 \nPast 30-day cigarillo use    \nNo \n62  \n68.1 \nYes \n29  \n31.9 \nPast 30-day little cigar use    \nNo \n71  \n78.0 \nYes \n20  \n22.0 \nPast 30-day smokeless tobacco use    \nNo \n83  \n91.2 \nYes \n8  \n8.8 \nPast 30-day hookah/waterpipe use    \nNo \n80  \n87.9 \nYes \n11  \n12.1 \nPast 30-day flavored tobacco product use    \nNo \n38  \n41.8 \nYes \n53  \n58.2 \nNotes.

Statements related to other \ncombustible drug use also appeared in this cluster, such as “I smoke \nmore marijuana now” (M = 2.52) and “I smoke more marijuana ciga­\nrillos” (M = 2.22). \n4. Discussion \nThis study identified nine themes describing how COVID-19 \nimpacted cigarette smokers in the U.S. The highest rated cluster in \nthis study was the Smoking More cluster. These results are similar to \nprevious studies demonstrating that smokers reported smoking more \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic (Elling et al., 2020; Cordon et al., 2021; \nGendall et al., 2021; Ferrante and Fearnside, 2020; Sidor and Rzymski, \n2020; Stanton et al., 2020; Vanderbruggen et al., 2020). Statements that \nwere grouped in this cluster such as “I smoke more for something to do” \nand “I smoke several cigarettes in a row/chain-smoke due to boredom” \nwere similar to two previous studies that also reported boredom as a \nreason for increased smoking during in nearly half of both study samples \n(Bommele et al., 2020; Vanderbruggen et al., 2020). Statements about \nsmoking less and attempting to quit smoking were not highly endorsed \nby participants in the current study, in contrast to previous findings from \nonline surveys in Italy and the UK e.g. (Niedzwiedz et al., 2021; Di Renzo \net al., 2020), but similar to online surveys in Belgium, Poland and \nAustralia that have low reported incidence of smoking less in response to \nCOVID-19 (Sidor and Rzymski, 2020; Stanton et al., 2020; Vander­\nbruggen et al., 2020). \nSeveral statements in this Concerns about Smoking and COVID-19 Risk \ncluster suggest that smokers are aware of increasing their risk of com­\nplications from COVID-19 by smoking cigarettes. That aside, statements \nabout being unable to quit smoking despite concerns about suscepti­\nbility to COVID-19 were also included in this cluster. This could be \nbecause smoking is used a coping method or a stress reduction tech­\nnique, as suggested by the statements in the current study “smoking \nkeeps me calm” and “I smoke more cigarettes now because COVID-19 \ngives me stress/anxiety”. Other recent work supports the connection \nbetween stress and smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic; in a small \nsample of treatment-seeking smokers in the US, those who reported \ndifficulty quitting during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated this was due \nto stress (Rosoff-Verbit et al., 2021). Further, statements in the current \nstudy such as “I know I need to quit, but I am not ready right now” \npossibly reflect this difficulty in the current sample of smokers. Other \nrecent work supports this finding; in a sample of Dutch smokers, 24.7% \nreported that quitting smoking had become more difficult during \nCOVID-19, while only 6.4% reported it had become easier (Bommele \net al., 2020). \nIncreased reliance on cigarettes to combat stress associated with \nCOVID-19, as observed in this study by statements such as “my de­\npendency on cigarettes has increased since COVID-19” and “I cannot \nseem to control my tobacco use since COVID-19” may explain that \ndespite financial difficulties and income limitations, many participants \nprioritized purchasing cigarettes during COVID-19 and many extended \ntheir cigarette supply through rationing cigarettes. Statements such as \nthose suggesting saving half-smoked cigarettes or making cigarettes out \nof the tobacco from cigarette butts are concerning due to the added \ntoxicity of smoking previously combusted tobacco (Dark et al., 1963; \nRimington, 1974; Zimmermann et al., 2014), thus further increasing the \nhealth burden of smoking on this population and possibly increasing the \nseverity of infection of COVID-19. \nHowever, some participants in the current study recognized the \nadded health benefits of quitting smoking during the COVID-19 \npandemic as observed by statements such as “I am trying to quit \nsmoking to decrease the chances of getting COVID-19”, “I try quitting \nwith more frequency now”, and “I am less interested in smoking now”. \nAlthough these statements were not strongly endorsed in the current \nstudy, a US study found that those who felt that smoking was risk factor \nfor COVID-19 were more likely to report interest in quitting, although \nonly a fifth of participants (21%) indicated that they were actually \nsmoking less (Streck et al., 2021). In other studies of smokers trying to \nquit, participants indicated that concerns about COVID-19 and smoking \nincreased their motivation to quit (Rosoff-Verbiet et al., 2021). Thus, \ninformation regarding the health effects of COVID-19 on smokers spe­\ncifically may increase smokers’ motivations to quit and possibly increase \nquit attempts once their stress levels have been addressed. \nOf concern were statements in the Minimal/No Impacts on Smoking \nBehavior cluster that indicated that participants were less concerned \nabout their smoking habits or misinformed that smoking could be a \nprotective factor against COVID-19, as well as statements in the Use of \nOther Tobacco Products/Drugs cluster that indicated that participants \nused cigarettes more frequently in combination with other tobacco \nproducts and other drugs such as alcohol and cannabis during COVID- \n19. While early reports of COVID-19 infections may have suggested \nthat smoking may be a protective factor for contracting COVID-19 and \ndeveloping severe infections (De Lusignan et al., 2020; Farsalinos et al., \n2020; Paleiron et al., 2021), other reports have demonstrated that \ncigarette smokers are more susceptible to COVID-19 infections (Cattar­\nuzza et al., 2020; Emami et al., 2020; Patanavanich et al., 2020; Jackson \net al., 2020; Lowe et al., 2021; Gaiha et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2020; \nUmnuaypornlert et al., 2021). The results from the current study \ndemonstrate the need to correct misinformation regarding COVID-19, \nespecially among susceptible populations. Launching public awareness \ncampaigns regarding cigarette smoking and susceptibility to COVID-19 \nmay increase motivations and self-efficacy for some smokers to quit \nsmoking and may reach some smokers who may have otherwise not quit. \nFinally, the current study and others have found reports of increased use \nof other substances in addition to increases in cigarette smoking, spe­\ncifically alcohol (Ferrante et al., 2020; Sidor and Rzymski, 2020; Stanton \net al., 2020; Vanderbruggen et al., 2020) and cannabis (Vanderbruggen \net al., 2020). Co-use of substances further increases the likelihood of \nhealth burdens faced by smokers. \nThis study had several limitations. The small sample may limit the \ngeneralizability of the findings, however, this sample size is sufficient for \nconcept mapping and participants were recruited from 12 states, 3 from \neach of the four census tract regions across the U.S. Although this study \ndescribed a broad range of impacts of COVID-19 on cigarette smokers \nthrough the statements provided, this method does not allow for esti­\nmates of prevalence of behaviors among the population. However, \nhigher ratings of some statements give indicators of behaviors and be­\nliefs that may be more common among smokers. Future studies would \nbenefit from examining the prevalence of behaviors identified in this \nstudy and how the prevalence of these behaviors have changed across \ntime and different populations. The current sample consisted of adults \nand did not include youth and adolescent smokers who may have been \nuniquely impacted. Examining the prevalence of these behaviors and \nany additional smoking behaviors that may be unique to these younger \npopulations, such as ECIG use, would likely be beneficial for public \nhealth officials. Finally, future research would also benefit from \nassessing the links between anxiety, stress, and depression and \nendorsement of the smoking behaviors identified in the current study to \nuncover links and associations between smoking and emotional and \npsychological distress (Stanton et al., 2020). Despite these limitations, \nthis study had many strengths including using a validated mixed \nmethods approach to identify content themes and it included smokers \nfrom across the U.S. Finally, this study was conducted in the summer of \n2020 shortly after many localities had implemented stay-at-home or­\nders. Thus, recall bias among the sample was likely minimal. \n5. Conclusions \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact on society and this \nstudy reveals that cigarette smokers have endured unique impacts due to \nCOVID-19. U.S. adult cigarette smokers in the current sample reported \nsmoking more since the COVID-19 pandemic despite many being \nS.F.

Participants also reported making efforts to ensure their \ncigarette supply, even though some were facing finical difficulties. \nFuture research would benefit from examining the relationship between \ncigarette smokers’ behaviors, beliefs, physical and mental health, and \nthe short- and long-term risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing \nserious and potentially life-threatening complications. \nFunding \nThe work was supported by grant number U54DA036105 from the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis­\ntration, USA, as well as, grant number F31DA047018 from the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health, USA. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nSarah F.

Considering the known role \nof cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, \nunderstanding the different aspects of COVID-19 in \nsmokers is of great importance.\nThe tobacco available in cigarette smoke contains \nnicotine, which interferes with the renin-angiotensin \nsystem and notably alters the expression of angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme-2 (ACE-2)1, the entry receptor for \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-\nCoV-2),2 in various organs including lungs.1 In addition, \nnicotine affects the immune cells, exerts anti-inflammatory \nproperties through the cholinergic pathway, and regulates \ncytokine release.3 These effects can potentially play a role \nin different phases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the \nresulting acute respiratory distress syndrome. Intermittent \nheating of nasopharynx as a result of inhalation of smoke \nalso may play a role but currently no supporting data is \navailable. \n Regarding these facts, using the available articles in the \nliterature, we aimed to compare the reported prevalence of \nsmoking in patients with COVID-19 to the prevalence of \nsmoking in the general population of the corresponding \nreport.4,5\nMaterials and Methods \nA structured literature review in PubMed was conducted \non April 28, 2020. We only included papers that were \naccepted in peer-reviewed journals at the time of literature \nretrieval. A PubMed search using the terms coronavirus \ndisease 2019 or COVID-19 or COVID or SARS-CoV-2 \nin the title and/or abstract as well as using the MeSH \nsupplementary concept COVID-19 was performed. \nAmong the screened papers, we found 12 papers in which \nepidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, \nincluding smoking status, were described.6-17 We reviewed \neach report and recorded the data in data collection tool. \nWe used the data for current smokers for our analysis \nunless a study had no exclusive data for current smokers. \nFor each report, by conducting a binomial test, using \nGraphPad Prism version 8.0, we compared the observed \nproportion of smokers in its study sample of patients \nwith COVID-19 to the hypothesized value, based on the \nprevalence of current smokers in the general population \n*Corresponding Author: Samad Ghaffari,  Email: Ghafaris@gmail.com\n© 2020 The Author (s).

Considering the role of cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis \nof lung diseases and the effect of nicotine on expression of the entry receptor for severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is important to determine the implications of smoking in \nCOVID-19. \nMethods: In this brief report, by using the published articles in the literature, we aimed to compare the \nreported prevalence of smoking in patients with COVID-19 to the prevalence of smoking in the general \npopulation of the corresponding report. Binomial tests were conducted and a P value of less than 0.05 \nwas considered statistically significant. \nResults: Among the screened papers, we found 12 peer-reviewed articles in which epidemiological \ncharacteristics of COVID-19 patients, including smoking status, were stated. Based on the descriptive \nreports of characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we observed a significantly lower proportion of \nCOVID-19 patients with smoking history compared to what is expected, given the population average \nfor each study’s geographic area. \nConclusion: This analysis of available data showed a lower prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 \npatients in comparison to the regional average. Considering the limitations of the study, the results \nshould be interpreted with great caution and be viewed just as a preliminary report to motivate related \nbasic and clinical researches.\nArticle info\nTUOMS\nPRESS\nNicotine in Covid19- era\nJ Cardiovasc Thorac Res, 2020, 12(2), 136-139\n137\nof the corresponding report.

As presented in Table 1, based on \nthe descriptive reports of characteristics of COVID-19 \npatients, we observed a significantly lower proportion \nof COVID-19 patients with smoking history compared \nto what is expected, given the population average of the \nstudy’s geographic area.\nDiscussion\nThe lower reported prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 \nin comparison to the regional average is an interesting \nfinding that needs further investigations and clarification. \nAlthough not examined in our analysis, the effect of \nsmoking on disease severity, as presented in Table 1, is \nalso inconsistent among studies. In some reports, the \nprevalence of smoking was higher in COVID-19 patients \nwho experienced an adverse outcome.8,9,13 However, \nother reports did not find a significant association \nbetween smoking history and adverse outcomes in \nCOVID-19.6,10,11,15 Considering the descriptive nature of \nthe investigated reports with no control group, lack of \ninformation about the age groups of smokers in studies, \nand other confounding factors, our findings should be \nconsidered as hypothesis-generating indicating the need \nfor further controlled studies. \nBased on earlier studies on SARS-CoV, it is revealed \nthat ACE-2 plays a role in the replication of viral genome \nand modulation of the immune response in SARS-\nCoV infected cells, as well.18 Adhesion of SARS-CoV to \nACE-2 can also ultimately induce a reduction in ACE-2 \nexpression. Since ACE-2 is involved in the production \nof angiotensin 1-7, which has multiple effects including \nanti-inflammatory properties, the reduction in the ACE-2 \naxis activity may exacerbate the progression to the severe \nacute respiratory syndrome.19 In contrast, an increase \nin ACE-2 axis activity may potentially have protective \neffects against lung injury.20 Cigarette smoking increases \nACE-2 expression in lower respiratory system.18 While \nthe physiologic function of ACE-2 in the airways is \nmainly undetermined,21 the increased ACE-2 expression \nas a result of smoking may potentially increase the \nsusceptibility of smokers for SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nOn the other hand, it may theoretically have some anti-\ninflammatory effects through the upregulation of ACE-\n2 axis activity as well as modulation of the cholinergic \npathway, and regulation of cytokine release. The improper \nhyperactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway is involved \nin the latter phase of COVID-19 and is associated with \nthe development of severe acute respiratory syndrome.22 \nFurthermore, exposure to tobacco smoke may inhibit NF-\nkappaB pathway activation.23 While this effect can impair \nthe innate immunity of the smokers,24 it may have some \nimplications for reducing the burden of cytokine storm in \ninfected individuals. \nRegarding these facts, the possibility of underdiagnosis \nin smokers and differences in the course of the disease \nhas to be investigated yet. Determining the likelihood of \nsubclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection in smokers as a possible \ncause of underrepresentation in reported COVID-19 \npatients has a crucial role in detecting the infected cases \nand implementing necessary public health measures. \nConsidering the limitations of the study, the findings of \nthis manuscript should be interpreted with great caution \nand be considered a preliminary report just to motivate \nresearchers in the basic and clinical fields to conduct \nfurther related studies.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nEthical approval\nNot applicable.\nFunding \nNone.\nReferences\n1.\t\nOakes JM, Fuchs RM, Gardner JD, Lazartigues E, Yue X. \nNicotine and the renin-angiotensin system.

  "30-Articolo-97-2-10-20210907.pdf": "S\nin dall’inizio della pandemia da coronavirus di \nfine 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), si è cercato di capire \nquale potesse essere il ruolo potenziale di al-\ncuni stili di vita sull’incidenza dell’infezione da \nSARS-CoV-2 e sul decorso della malattia COVID-19. \nSono così stati pubblicati centinaia di articoli o com-\nmenti sulla relazione tra il fumo di sigaretta e il rischio \ndi incidenza, gravità e mortalità per COVID-19. Que-\nsti articoli hanno mostrato frequentemente risultati \ncontrastanti che lasciavano spesso confuso il lettore. \nIn occasione della Giornata Mondiale senza Tabacco \nsi è voluto fare chiarezza sull’attuale evidenza scienti-\nfica riguardo alla relazione tra fumo e COVID-19. È \nstato poi presentato uno studio multicentrico italiano \ncon l’obiettivo di quantificare proprio l’associazione \ntra fumo e gravità e mortalità per COVID-19: lo studio \nCOSMO-IT [1].\nDall’inizio della pandemia, decine e decine di articoli \npubblicati su riviste peer-reviewed – o su archivi di ar-\nticoli preprint – hanno fornito informazioni sulla preva-\nlenza dei fumatori tra i soggetti con SARS-CoV-2 o tra \nserie di pazienti con COVID-19. La prevalenza di fu-\nmatori, variando da 0 al 70% in Asia, da 0 al 23% in \nEuropa e dall’1 al 35% nelle Americhe, risultava piut-\ntosto eterogenea. Più importante, la prevalenza di fu-\nmo era sistematicamente molto inferiore rispetto alle \nstime di prevalenza tra gli adulti dei Paesi dove erano \nstati condotti gli studi [2]. Questo aveva fatto pensare \nche il fumo potesse avere un ruolo protettivo per l’in-\ncidenza della infezione da SARS-CoV-2. È importante \nmettere in chiaro che queste indagini hanno numero-\nse limitazioni. Il disegno di studio di tutte queste ricer-\nCOVID-19 e fumo: \nevidenze dall’Italia e dal mondo\nSilvano Gallus\nSmoking and COVID-19: current \nevidence from Italy and the world\nSilvano Gallus\nS\nince the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in \nlate 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), great effort has been \nmade to understand the potential role of se-\nlected lifestyle habits on SARS-CoV-2 infection \nand the progression of COVID-19 disease. Several \nstudies have been conducted and hundreds of arti-\ncles or commentaries have been published on the re-\nlationship between cigarette smoking and the risk of \nincidence, severity and mortality for COVID-19. These \narticles frequently showed contrasting results that of-\nten-confused readers. In occasion of the World No \nTobacco Day we tried to elucidate on the current sci-\nentific evidence regarding the relationship between \nsmoking and COVID-19. It was then presented a mul-\nticentric Italian study with the aim of quantifying the \nassociation between smoking and severity and mor-\ntality for COVID-19: the COSMO-IT study [1]. \nSince the start of the pandemic, a number of articles \npublished in peer-reviewed journals - or in preprint ar-\nchives - have provided information on the prevalence \nof smokers among subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection \nor among series of patients with COVID-19 disease. \nThe prevalence of smokers was quite heterogeneous, \nranging from 0% to 70% in Asia, from 0% to 23% in \nEurope, and from 1% to 35% in the Americas. More \nimportantly, smoking prevalence was systematically \nlower than adult prevalence estimates observed in \ncountries where the studies were conducted [2]. This \nsuggested that smoking could have a protective role \non the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is import-\nant to mention that these investigations hid numerous \nlimitations. The study design of all these researches is \nthe one used in case series which cannot be used to \nderive any causal conclusions since they do not have a \ncontrol group. In addition, most of these studies are \nsubjected to information bias and, above all, import-\n21\nAtti XXIII Convegno Nazionale Tabagismo e SSN\nTabaccologia 2-2021\nche è quello delle “serie di casi” che, non avendo un \ngruppo di controllo, non possono essere utilizzate per \ntrarre alcuna conclusione causale. Inoltre, molti di \nquesti studi soffrono di bias di informazione e, soprat-\ntutto, di importanti bias di selezione: molte serie di ca-\nsi sono basate su popolazioni selezionate con una \nbassa proporzione di fumatori (per esempio, anziani e \noperatori sanitari), altri non sono disegnati con lo sco-\npo di indagare il fumo, e in alcuni studi tale informa-\nzione è ricavata solo dalle cartelle cliniche (di frequen-\nte senza informazioni sul fumo). Infine, spesso (o \nsempre) i malati gravi sono esclusi dagli studi. Non si \npuò pertanto basare l’evidenza sull’associazione tra fu-\nmo e incidenza di COVID-19 su questo tipo di studi. È \nnecessario invece basarsi sul crescente numero di stu-\ndi di coorte che indagano l’incidenza di COVID-19 e \nche sono condotti sulla popolazione generale. Simons \ne coll., in una metanalisi – basata su questo tipo di \nstudi e aggiornata a marzo 2021 [2] – hanno mostrato \ncome, rispetto a coloro che non avevano mai fumato, i \nfumatori hanno un rischio relativo, RR, di 0,71 (inter-\nvallo di confidenza, CI, al 95%: 0,61-0,82) e gli ex fu-\nmatori di 1,03 (95% CI: 0,95-1,11).\nPer quanto riguarda invece la gravità e mortalità per \nCOVID-19, ci sono meno dubbi: i fumatori hanno più \nfrequentemente un decorso sfavorevole della malattia \nrispetto ai non fumatori [3,4]. Questo viene attestato \nda un’altra metanalisi aggiornata e condotta nel 2021 \nda Umnuaypornlert e coll. [5], che hanno messo in \nevidenza come coloro che fumano hanno un rischio \nmaggiore sia di gravità della malattia (RR = 1,58; 95% \nCI: 1,16-2,15) che di mortalità (RR = 1,46; 95% CI: \n1,18-1,79) (Figura 1). Gli ex fumatori mostrano an-\nch’essi un eccesso di rischio rispetto a coloro che non \nhanno mai fumato.\nPer quanto concerne l’attuale evidenza scientifica, si \npuò pertanto concludere che molte serie di casi di pa-\nzienti con COVID-19 mostrano basse prevalenze di fu-\nmo. Questi studi sono soggetti a maggiori limitazioni \ne non dovrebbero essere considerati per la valutazio-\nne dell’associazione. Dobbiamo, infatti, basare la co-\nnoscenza su studi di coorte. Le metanalisi basate su \nquesti studi longitudinali mostrano risultati contrastan-\nti e meno eclatanti riguardo al ruolo del fumo sull’infe-\nzione da SARS-CoV-2. Esiste invece una acclarata evi-\ndenza di un eccesso di rischio del 30-50% di gravità e \nmortalità per COVID-19 per i fumatori (sia attuali che \nex fumatori) rispetto a coloro che non fumano.\nPochi dati sono disponibili dall’Italia. Lo studio CO-\nSMO-IT ha appena ultimato l’arruolamento di circa \n2.000 pazienti con una diagnosi confermata di CO-\nVID-19 e presto verrà effettuata l’analisi dell’intero \nant selection bias: many case series are indeed based \non selected populations with a low proportion of \nsmokers (e.g., elderly, health workers). Other studies \nare not designed to investigate smoking and in some \nof them this information is derived only from medical \nrecords (frequently without information on smoking \nhabits). Finally, often (or always) patients with a more \nsevere Covid-19 are systematically excluded from the \nstudies. Therefore, evidence of the association be-\ntween smoking and SARS-CoV-2 incidence cannot be \nbased on this type of studies. Instead, evidence \nshould be built on the increasing number of cohort \nstudies investigating the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in-\nfection on samples based on the general population. \nSimons et al., in a meta-analysis -based on this type of \nstudies, updated in March 2021 [2], showed how, \ncompared to never smokers, current smokers have a \nrelative risk, RR, of 0.71 (confidence interval, CI, 95%: \n0.61-0.82) and ex-smokers of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.95-1.11) \nof being infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nFor what concerns COVID-19 severity and mortality, \nthe evidence is more robust: compared to non-smok-\ners, current smokers have more frequently an unfa-\nvourable progression of the disease [3, 4]. This is con-\nfirmed by another meta-analysis conducted and \nupdated in 2021 by Umnuaypornlert et al.[5], who \npointed out that current smokers have a greater risk \nof both COVID-19 severity (RR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.16-\n2.15) and mortality (RR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.18-1.79) \n(Figure 1). Ex-smokers also show an excess of risk of a \nsevere progression of the disease compared to never \nsmokers. Therefore, the current scientific evidence \nshows that many case-series of COVID-19 patients re-\nport a low prevalence of smokers. These studies are \nsubjected to major limitations and should not be con-\nsidered for the assessment of any causal association. \nWe need to base our knowledge on cohort studies. \nMeta-analyses based on these longitudinal studies \nshow contrasting and less striking results regarding \nthe role of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the \nother hand, there is strong evidence of an excess-risk \nof 30-50% on COVID-19 severity and mortality forev-\ner smokers (both current and ex-smokers) compared \nto non-smokers.\nFew data are available from Italy. The COSMO-IT \nstudy has just completed the recruitment of about \n2000 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of \nCOVID-19 and soon the analysis of the entire sample \nof patients will be carried out. It is an observational, \nlongitudinal, and multicentric Italian study (24 centers \nselected throughout Italy, Figure 2), conducted by \nthe Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri \nin Milan in collaboration with the Istituto per lo stu-\ndio, la prevenzione e la rete oncologica (ISPRO) of \nFlorence, the Società Italiana di Tabaccologia (SITAB), \nthe Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS), the Sapienza Uni-\nversity of Rome and the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori \nof Milan [1].\nAtti XXIII Convegno Nazionale Tabagismo e SSN\n22\nTabaccologia 2-2021\ncampione di pazienti.

In particular, the project aims to \nquantify the association between smoking habits and \nrisk of severity and mortality of COVID-19, assess the \nrole of smoking cessation on the progression of \nCOVID-19, quantify the association between other po-\ntential risk factors and the risk of an unfavourable pro-\ngression of COVID-19, compare the smoking status in \nhospitalized patients with that in patients placed in \nhome isolation in some territorial realities. The ques-\ntionnaire, delivered through either a paper-and-pencil \nmode, or an online or an offline tool, collects informa-\ntion on socio-demographic characteristics, habits and \nlifestyles, comorbidity and past drug therapies, symp-\ntoms, treatment for COVID-19, and potential risk fac-\ntors, such as: body mass index, smoking habit, elec-\ntronic cigarette use, heated tobacco product use, \nsecond-hand smoke, alcohol consumption, pre-exist-\ning diseases, sleep apnea and drug use. The question-\nnaire also contains a specific section on hospitalization \nor home isolation subsequent to COVID-19 diagnosis \ncontaining information on hospitalization and treat-\nment during hospitalization/isolation, complications \nduring hospitalization/isolation, outcome or transfer to \nanother facility/hospital.\nSome preliminary results were presented during the \nWorld No Tobacco Day. Initial analyses were carried \nout on 1406 COVID-19 patients from 16 centres. In \nthis population, 18.6% had an unfavourable progres-\nsion of the disease (i.e., composite outcome: intuba-\ntion, intensive care unit or death). Mortality was only \navailable in selected centers, where 15.1% of patients \ndied due to COVID-19.\nThe average age of the entire sample was 65 years. It \nis important to note, however, that the average age of \ncurrent smokers was 58, the average age of ex-smok-\ners was 67, and the average age of those who had \nnever smoked was 64 years. Therefore, compared to \nnever smokers, ex-smokers were 3 years older and cur-\nrent smokers were 6 years younger. These age differ-\nences are not negligible. Indeed, they are hugely rele-\nvant if we consider that in Italy, as in the rest of the \nworld, the risk of lethality for COVID-19 cases increas-\nFigura 1  Fumo e severità/mortalità per COVID-19 (mod. da Umnuaypornlert et al.)

Il questionario, raccolto sia in cartaceo che in \nmodalità online o offline, contiene informazioni su ca-\nratteristiche sociodemografiche, abitudini e stili di vi-\nta, comorbilità e pregresse terapie farmacologiche, \nsintomi, trattamento per il COVID-19 e potenziali fat-\ntori di rischio, quali: indice di massa corporea, abitu-\ndine al fumo, sigaretta elettronica, tabacco riscaldato, \nfumo passivo, consumo di alcool, patologie pre-esi-\nstenti, apnee notturne, uso di farmaci. Il questionario \ncontiene anche una sezione specifica relativa all’ospe-\ndalizzazione o all’isolamento domiciliare in seguito a \ndiagnosi di COVID-19 che riporta informazioni sul ri-\nes significantly with increasing age: even threefold ev-\nery 10 years of age [6]. Therefore, even assuming that \nthere is no association between smoking and \nCOVID-19 mortality risk, the different age distribution \nof current smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers \nwould result in a misleading substantial reduction in \nthe risk of mortality for current smokers compared to \nnever smokers and to an excess of risk for ex-smokers. \nIn the analysis of the association between smoking and \nrisk of (severity and) mortality for COVID-19 it is there-\nfore necessary to remove the effect of age by conduct-\ning multivariable analyses adjusting at least for age \n(and sex). Unfortunately, most of the studies available \nso far in the scientific literature on this topic do not \nprovide adjusted risk estimates, not even for age [2, 5]. \nIn all these studies, providing only univariate risk esti-\nmates (also called “rough estimates”), risks are likely to \nbe under-estimated for current smokers and over-esti-\nmated for ex-smokers. This perspective shows how it is \nstill necessary to provide new data well collected and \nwell analyzed to quantify the role of smoking on \nCOVID-19. In the COSMO-IT study, multivariate analy-\nses, adjusted for sex, age, education and comorbidity, \nshow that, compared to men, women are less likely to \ndevelop a severe form of COVID-19 (odds ratio, OR = \n0.62; 95% CI: 0.45-0.84). In addition, the frequency of \nsevere cases or mortality for COVID-19 increases with \nincreasing age (p per trend < 0.001).\nIn conclusion, the scientific literature shows contrast-\ning results on the role of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 in-\nfection but a clear evidence of an excess risk by 30-\n50% on COVID-19 severity and mortality for smokers \ncompared to non-smokers. Preliminary data from the \nCOSMO-IT study highlight the need to consider only \nage-adjusted (and sex-adjusted) risk estimates. The \nCOSMO-IT will be among the first studies providing \nimportant results on the association between smok-\ning, smoking cessation, electronic cigarette use, heat-\ned tobacco product use and second-hand smoke and \nthe risk of severity and mortality for COVID-19. Above \nall, this study shows that with motivation and commit-\nment, even without funding, it is possible to conduct \nindependent multi-centric studies that can provide a \nhuge contribution to scientific knowledge.\nFigura 2  Centri italiani (24) coinvolti nello studio COSMO-IT.\nFigure 2  Italian Centers (24) involved in COSMO-IT Trial.\n\tRaccolta dati completa\n\t\nComplete data collection (21)\n\tRaccolta dati ongoing\n\t\nOngoing data collection (3)\nAtti XXIII Convegno Nazionale Tabagismo e SSN\n24\nTabaccologia 2-2021\ncovero e trattamento durante il ricovero/isolamento, \ncomplicanze durante ricovero/isolamento, esito o tra-\nsferimento in un’altra struttura/ospedale.\nAlcuni risultati preliminari sono stati presentati duran-\nte la Giornata Mondiale senza Tabacco. Le analisi ini-\nziali sono state condotte su 1.406 soggetti provenien-\nti da 16 Centri. In questa popolazione, il 18,6% aveva \navuto un decorso di malattia sfavorevole (cioè, outco-\nme composito: necessità di essere intubato, Terapia \nIntensiva o decesso). La mortalità era disponibile solo \nin selezionati Centri, dove il 15,1% risultava deceduto \na causa del COVID-19. \nL’età media dell’intero campione era di 65 anni. È im-\nportante però fare notare come l’età media dei fuma-\ntori era di 58 anni, degli ex fumatori era di 67 anni e \nl’età media di coloro che non avevano mai fumato era \ndi 64 anni. Pertanto, rispetto ai mai fumatori, gli ex fu-\nmatori erano più anziani di 3 anni e i fumatori risulta-\nvano più giovani di 6 anni. Queste differenze di età \nnon sono per niente marginali. Sono invece molto im-\nportanti se si pensa che in Italia, come nel resto del \nmondo, il rischio di letalità per i casi di COVID-19 au-\nmenta sensibilmente all’aumentare dell’età: addirittu-\nra triplica ogni 10 anni di età [6]. Pertanto, anche as-\nsumendo che non ci sia alcuna associazione tra fumo \ne rischio di mortalità per COVID-19, la differente di-\nstribuzione d’età di fumatori, ex fumatori e mai fuma-\ntori porterebbe a una fuorviante riduzione sostanziale \ndel rischio di mortalità per i fumatori rispetto a coloro \nche non hanno mai fumato e a un eccesso di rischio \nper gli ex fumatori. Nell’analisi dell’associazione tra \nfumo e rischio di (gravità e) mortalità per COVID-19 è \nnecessario quindi eliminare l’effetto dell’età tramite la \nconduzione di analisi multivariate che aggiustino al-\nmeno per età (e per sesso). Purtroppo, la maggior \nparte degli studi disponibili in letteratura scientifica su \nquesto argomento non forniscono stime dei rischi ag-\ngiustate, neppure per età [2,5]. In tutti questi studi \nche forniscono solo stime di rischio univariate (anche \nchiamate “stime grezze”), i rischi forniti sono verosi-\nmilmente sotto-stimati per i fumatori e sovra-stimati \nper gli ex fumatori. Questo ragionamento fa capire \ncome sia ancora necessario rendere disponibili nuovi \ndati ben raccolti e ben analizzati per quantificare il \nruolo del fumo sul COVID-19.\nLe analisi multivariate dello studio COSMO-IT, aggiu-\nstate per sesso, età, istruzione e comorbilità, mostra-\nno che, rispetto agli uomini, le donne sono protette \nda una più grave forma di COVID-19 (odds ratio, OR \n= 0,62; 95% CI: 0,45-0,84). Inoltre, all’aumentare \ndell’età aumenta la frequenza di casi gravi o di morta-\nlità per COVID-19 (p per trend < 0,001).\nIn conclusione, la letteratura scientifica mostra risultati \ncontrastanti sul ruolo del fumo sull’infezione da SARS-\nCoV-2 ma un’acclamata evidenza di un eccesso di ri-\nschio del 30-50% di gravità e mortalità per COVID-19. \nI dati preliminari dello studio COSMO-IT mettono in \nluce la necessità di considerare solo stime dei rischi \naggiustate per età (e per sesso). Lo studio COSMO-IT \nsarà tra i primi a fornire importanti risultati sull’asso-\nciazione tra fumo, cessazione del fumo, sigaretta elet-\ntronica, tabacco riscaldato e fumo passivo e rischio di \ngravità e mortalità per COVID-19. Questo studio di-\nmostra soprattutto che con motivazione e impegno, \nanche senza finanziamenti, è possibile condurre studi \nindipendenti multicentrici che possono fornire un \nenorme contributo alla conoscenza scientifica.\n[Tabaccologia 2021; XIX(2):21-25]\nhttps://doi.org/10.53127/tblg-2021-A014\nSilvano Gallus\nDipartimento di Ambiente e Salute,\nIstituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche\n“Mario Negri” IRCCS, Milano\n silvano.gallus@marionegri.it\nBibliografia\n1.

Vardavas1,2, Katerina Nikitara2\nCOVID-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei \nProvince, China, in December 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic \nspreading rapidly worldwide1,2. As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 \ncases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of \nwhich have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)3. \nHowever, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are \nlimited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as \nto their prognostic factors4. Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly \nassociated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted \nthe negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with \na plethora of respiratory diseases5. Smoking is also detrimental to the immune \nsystem and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to \ninfectious diseases6. Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more \nlikely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, \nwhile smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-\nCoV outbreak7,8.\nGiven the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on \nCOVID-19 that included information on patients’ smoking status to evaluate the \nassociation between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of \nthe disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit \n(ICU) hospitalization and death.  \nThe literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases \n(PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [‘smoking’ OR ‘tobacco’ OR ‘risk \nfactors’ OR ‘smoker*’] AND [‘COVID-19’ OR ‘COVID 19’ OR ‘novel coronavirus’ \nOR ‘sars cov-2’ OR ‘sars cov 2’] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. \nFurther inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to \nhumans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. \nA total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded \nafter full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies \nwere conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland \nChina. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the \nsample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, \nretrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five \nstudies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December \n2019, January 2020).\nSpecifically, Zhou et al.9 studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 \nindividuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail \nthe mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the \n191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, \n9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no \nstatistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and \nAFFILIATION\n1 Department of Oral Health \nPolicy and Epidemiology, \nHarvard School of Dental \nMedicine, Boston, United \nStates\n2 School of Medicine, \nUniversity of Crete, Heraklion, \nGreece \nCORRESPONDENCE TO \nConstantine I.

The \nresults showed that among severe patients (n=58), \n3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former \nsmokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) \namong which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% \nwere former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% \nCI: 0.65–7.63; p=0.2). \nHuang et al.11 studied the epidemiological \ncharacteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In \nthis study, none of those who needed to be admitted \nto an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, \nthree patients from the non-ICU group were current \nsmokers, with no statistically significant difference \nbetween the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit \nthe small sample size of the study.  \nThe largest study population of 1099 patients with \nCOVID-19 was provided by Guan et al.12 from \nmultiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive \nresults on the smoking status of patients were \nprovided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had \nsevere symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. \nAmong the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% \nwere current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, \nin contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms \nwhere 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were \nformer smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients \nthat either needed mechanical ventilation, admission \nto an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and \n7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group \nof patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, \nonly 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were \nformer smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating \nthe association between the severity of the disease \noutcome and smoking status was conducted in that \nstudy. \nFinally, Liu et al.13 found among their population of \n78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome \ngroup had a significantly higher proportion of patients \nwith a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that \nshowed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this \ndifference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In \ntheir multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history \nof smoking was a risk factor of disease progression \n(OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58–25.00; p= 0.018). \nWe identified five studies that reported data on the \nsmoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. \nNotably, in the largest study that assessed severity, \nthere were higher percentages of current and former \nsmokers among patients that needed ICU support, \nmechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher \npercentage of smokers among the severe cases12. \nHowever, from their published data we can calculate \nthat the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, \n95% CI: 0.98–2.00) to have severe symptoms of \nCOVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely \nto be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation \nor die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: \n1.43–4.04).\nIn conclusion, although further research is warranted \nas the weight of the evidence increases, with the \nlimited available data, and although the above results \nare unadjusted for other factors that may impact \ndisease progression, smoking is most likely associated \nwith the negative progression and adverse outcomes \nof COVID-19. \nTable 1.

Glantz1*\nAbstract\nBackground: Smoking impairs lung immune function and damages upper airways, increasing risks of contracting\nand severity of infectious diseases. This paper quantifies the association between smoking and COVID-19 disease\nprogression.\nMethods: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published from January 1–May 25, 2020. We included\nstudies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease, including death. We used\nrandom effects meta-analysis, meta-regression and locally weighted regression and smoothing to examine\nrelationships in the data.\nResults: We identified 46 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 22,939 COVID-19 patients, 5421 (23.6%) experienced\ndisease progression and 2914 (12.7%) with a history of smoking (current and former smokers). Among those with a\nhistory of smoking, 33.5% experienced disease progression, compared with 21.9% of non-smokers. The meta-\nanalysis confirmed an association between ever smoking and COVID-19 progression (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.33–1.89, p =\n0.001). Ever smoking was associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02–1.39, p =\n0.003). We found no significant difference (p = 0.864) between the effects of ever smoking on COVID-19 disease\nprogression between adjusted and unadjusted analyses, suggesting that smoking is an independent risk factor for\nCOVID-19 disease progression. We also found the risk of having COVID-19 progression higher among younger\nadults (p = 0.001), with the effect most pronounced among younger adults under about 45 years old.\nConclusions: Smoking is an independent risk for having progression of COVID-19, including mortality. The effects\nseem to be higher among young people. Smoking prevention and cessation should remain a priority for the public,\nphysicians, and public health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKeywords: COVID-19, Coronavirus, Meta-analysis, Disease progression, Odds ratio, Death, Age effect\n© The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

As of April 2021, the virus had in-\nfected over 150 million people and caused more than 3\nmillion deaths [1]. Old people and those with pre-\nexisting medical conditions including respiratory disease,\nhypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and can-\ncer are more vulnerable to becoming critically ill when\ninfected [2].\nSmoking may enhance the risk of COVID-19 by its\nbiological effects and behaviors of smokers. Smoking im-\npairs lung function and pulmonary immune function,\ncompromising the body’s defense mechanisms against\ninfections [3]. Smoking is also a well-established risk fac-\ntor for chronic diseases that are linked to more severe\nCOVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) has\nadvised the public that smoking could increase the risk\nof contracting\nCOVID-19 because\nthe\nbehavior of\nsmokers involves contact of fingers with the lips and re-\nmoval of the protective face masks to smoke [4].\nOur recent meta-analysis of the 19 peer-reviewed pa-\npers found that smokers have double the odds of\nCOVID-19 progression risk [5]. Some people argue that\nthe association between underlying health conditions\nand risk factors such as smoking to the severity of\nCOVID-19 is still unclear due to inadequate adjustment\nof confounding factors [6]. In addition, it is unclear\nwhether the association between smoking and severity of\nCOVID-19 varies by age. This paper updates and ex-\ntends our previous meta-analysis [5] of 19 studies to add\n27 additional studies, including 6 that provided adjusted\nodds ratios and compared the association between\nsmoking and COVID-19 disease progression between\nunadjusted analyses with adjusted analyses to examine\nwhether smoking is an independent risk factor. We also\nassessed the effect of age of patients and conducted a\nsub-analysis for the risk of smoking on the mortality of\nCOVID-19.\nMethods\nThis study followed the Preferred Reporting in System-\natic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines\nand is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020186864).\nData source and search strategy\nWe conducted a systematic search using PubMed and\nEmbase on May 25, 2020, with the search term: “((smok-\ning) OR (characteristics) OR (risk factors) OR (retro-\nspective*)\nOR\n(outcomes)\nOR\n(smoker*))\nAND\n((COVID-19) OR (COVID) OR (coronavirus) OR (sars\ncov-2) OR (sars cov 2))” for studies published between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and May 25, 2020. A total of 2600\nstudies were retrieved through PubMed and 1962 studies\nthrough Embase.\nEligibility criteria\nEligible studies included published peer-reviewed obser-\nvational studies, retrospective cohort studies, prospective\ncohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case series, and\ncase reports that reported demographic characteristics,\ncomorbidities specifically smoking status, clinical mani-\nfestations, and clinical or disease outcomes of COVID-\n19 patients on disease progression of COVID-19 to more\nsevere or critical conditions or death. We included both\ninpatient and outpatient settings. We excluded studies\nthat did not report smoking status and outcomes, stud-\nies of children, studies that included other coronavirus\ninfection and not specifically to COVID-19, studies that\nthe number of smokers was zero or omitted, and studies\nin which all patients had the same outcome. There were\nno language restrictions.\nStudy selection and data extraction\nOne author (RP) extracted information for each study,\nscreened the abstract or the full text, with questions re-\nsolved through discussion among both authors (Fig. A1).\nThe exposure group for our analysis were those who\nhad a history of smoking (current smokers and former\nsmokers) and unexposed group was never smokers, non-\nsmokers, or not having a smoking history. Outcomes\nwere progression of COVID-19 to more severe or critical\nconditions or death. Definitions of smoking status and\ndisease progression for each study are shown in Table\nA1.\nQuality assessment\nWe evaluated the quality of studies using a modification\nof the ACROBAT-NRSI [7] tool on 5 domains: study\npopulation, exposure measurement, outcome assess-\nment,\nmeasurement\nof\nconfounders,\nand\nadequate\nfollow-up. Each one of these domains was scored from 0\n(low risk of bias) to 2 (high risk of bias) and the average\nscore of each study was computed and discussed among\nboth authors (Additional file and Table A2). Studies with\nthe average score higher than 1 were considered high\nrisk and excluded in a sensitivity analysis.\nStatistical analyses\nOur meta-analyses were based on unadjusted odds ratios\n(OR) that were either reported in the studies or com-\nputed unadjusted OR and 95% confidence interval (CI)\nusing the number of smokers (current and former) and\nnever smokers with and without disease progression. We\nalso did a sensitivity analysis to determine the results\nchanged when the 5 studies with high risk of bias were\nexcluded.\nPatanavanich and Glantz BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1554 \nPage 2 of 9\nWe performed subgroup analyses of (1) the studies\nthat reported association of smoking on COVID-19\nmortality and (2) the association of COVID-19 disease\nprogression between current smokers and never smokers\n(i.e., excluding former smokers), and former smokers\nand never smokers using the studies that reported\nwhether the patient was a current, former, or never\nsmoker (as separate categories).\nWe also computed the pooled adjusted OR using the\nstudies that reported adjusted OR and 95% CI and com-\npared it with the pooled unadjusted OR.\nThe results of the included studies were pooled with\nrandom-effect models using the Stata version 14.0 metan\ncommand and metabias command with Egger’s test for\nthe presence of publication bias. We used metareg com-\nmand (with dummy variables to account for the pairing\nof adjusted and unadjusted ORs) to determine whether\nthe adjustment of OR affected the results. We used lo-\ncally weighted regression and smoothing because both\nvisual inspection and analysis of residuals using a pre-\nliminary linear regression indicated a nonlinear relation-\nship between odds of disease progression and mean or\nmedian age reported in each study. The lowess com-\nmand was used to generate a nonparametric fit estimate.\nWe also tested for a trend using metareg command with\nmean age of each study as a continuous variable.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nFrom the total of 4562 studies we found from our\nsearch, 237 studies were considered retrospective co-\nhorts, prospective cohorts, or case series that provided\nclinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19\npatients. From the 237 studies, 83 studies reported\nsmoking status of the patients, but only 47 studies [8–\n54] reported smoking status and disease progression of\nCOVID-19 that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nOne study [31] was later retracted so that the final ana-\nlysis is based on 46 studies [8–30, 32–54]. (Fig. A1).\nOf the 46 studies (Table A1), 33 [11–14, 18–22, 24,\n27–30, 32, 36, 38–54] were from China, 8 [9, 10, 15, 17,\n23, 26, 34, 35] from the US, 3 [16, 33, 37] from Italy, 1\n[8] from the UK, and 1 [25] from South Korea.\nSeven studies [10, 12, 18, 27, 35, 37, 50] assessed\nwhether the patient was a current, former, or never\nsmoker (as separate categories), 15 [13, 15, 17, 21, 32,\n40–44, 46, 47, 51, 52, 54] studies assessed whether the\npatient was a “current smoker”, 24 [8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19,\n20, 22–26, 28–30, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 45, 48, 49, 53] stud-\nies assessed whether the patient had a “history of smok-\ning” (current and former). Forty-five studies [8, 9, 11–\n30, 32–54] reported the mean or median ages of\npatients.\nClinical outcome was defined as death in 7 studies [12,\n16, 26, 33, 34, 45, 54], intensive care unit (ICU) admis-\nsion or requirement of mechanical ventilation in 6 stud-\nies [8, 10, 15, 17, 21, 23], prolonged viral shredding in 2\nstudies [43, 44], severe or critical (respiratory distress\nwith respiratory rate ≥30/min, or oxygen saturation ≤\n93% at rest, or oxygenation index ≤300 mmHg, based on\nthe diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2\nissued by Chinese National Health Committee [55] or\nthe American Thoracic Society guidelines [56] for com-\nmunity acquired pneumonia) in 18 studies, the primary\ncomposite end point (ICU admission, the use of mech-\nanical ventilation, or death) in 2 studies [18, 47], abnor-\nmal chest imaging in 1 study [52], acute cardiac injury in\n1 study [19], progression of disease to more severe status\n(including increasing oxygen supplement, pneumonia\nexacerbation, transferred to ICU, and sepsis) in 10 stud-\nies [13, 20, 24, 25, 30, 32, 34, 37, 38, 48]. Forty-five stud-\nies [8–30, 32, 33, 35–54] reported the number of\nsmokers by clinical outcomes.\nThere were 5 studies [8, 13, 15, 33, 39] with high risk\nof bias scores (Table A2).\nEver smoking and COVID-19 disease progression\nA total of 22,939 COVID-19 patients are included in our\nmeta-analysis, 5421 of whom (23.6%) experienced dis-\nease progression and 2914 (12.7%) with a history of\nsmoking (current and former smokers). Among those\nwith a history of smoking, 33.5% experienced disease\nprogression, compared with 21.9% of non-smokers. The\nmeta-analysis showed an association between ever smok-\ning and COVID-19 progression (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.33–\n1.89, p = 0.001) (Fig. 1). There was statistically significant\nmoderate heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 43.9%,\np = 0.001) and no evidence of publication bias (p =\n0.387).\nSmoking prevalence (ever smoking) was significantly\nhigher among patients with disease progression than\nthose without disease progression (16.1% vs. 11.6%,; p =\n0.023 by paired t-test).\nEver smoking and COVID-19 mortality\nSeven studies [12, 16, 26, 33, 34, 45, 54] (n = 4362) re-\nported death as the outcome of COVID-19 patients. The\nmeta-analysis showed an association between ever smok-\ning and COVID-19 mortality (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02–\n1.39, p = 0.003; Fig. A3). There was no evidence of het-\nerogeneity among the studies (I2 = 0%, p = 0.548) and no\nevidence of publication bias (p = 0.662).\nStudies of current vs. never smokers and former vs. never\nsmokers\nThe 7 studies [10, 12, 18, 27, 35, 37, 50] that reported\ncurrent, former vs. never smokers yielded an elevated\nPatanavanich and Glantz BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1554 \nPage 3 of 9\npoint estimate for the effect of current smokers on\nCOVID-19 progression (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.83–2.22, p =\n0.230; Fig. A4), but it did not reach conventional statis-\ntical significance. There was statistically significant mod-\nerate\nheterogeneity\n(I2\n= 56.3%,\np = 0.033)\nand\nno\nevidence of publication bias (p = 0.368). Former smokers\nwere more likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19\ndisease progression compared with never smokers (OR =\n2.27, 95% CI = 1.34–3.85, p = 0.002). There was statisti-\ncally significant high heterogeneity (I2 = 75.6%, p =\n0.001) and no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.387).\nUnadjusted vs. adjusted analyses\nSix studies [20, 26, 30, 34, 35, 48] reported adjusted\nORs. The point estimate for the adjusted ORs (OR 1.95,\n95% CI 1.12–3.41, p = 0.018; Fig. A5, top) was higher\nthan the point estimate for unadjusted ORs (OR 1.60,\n95% CI 1.11–2.33, p = 0.013; Fig. A5, bottom), but this\ndifference was not significant (p = 0.864). For the ad-\njusted ORs, the heterogeneity among the studies was\nhigh and statistically significant (I2 = 80.2%, p = 0.001)\nwith evidence of publication bias (p = 0.003). For the un-\nadjusted ORs, the heterogeneity among the studies was\nmoderate and statistically significant (I2 = 65.7%, p =\n0.008) with evidence of publication bias (p = 0.002).\nAssociation between ever smoking and COVID-19 disease\nprogression by age\nThe odds of COVID-19 disease progression between\nsmokers and non-smokers dropped as the patients’ mean\nage increased across studies, with the drop most pro-\nnounced for studies where the mean age was less than\nabout 45 years old (Fig. 2). A meta-regression of the\nodds of COVID-19 disease progression between smokers\nand non-smokers and the patients’ mean age showed\nthat each the odds of disease progression dropped\nFig. 1 Ever (current and former) smoking and COVID-19 disease progression\nPatanavanich and Glantz BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1554 \nPage 4 of 9\nstatistically significantly by a factor of 0.78 (95% CI\n0.69–0.89, p = 0.001) per 10 years.\nSensitivity analysis\nDropping the 5 studies [8, 13, 15, 33, 39] with high risk\nof bias scores had little effect on the odds of COVID-19\ndisease progression (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.33–1.92, p =\n0.001; Fig. A2). The heterogeneity among the studies\nwas moderate and statistically significant (I2 = 49.5%,\np = 0.001) and there was no evidence of publication bias\n(p = 0.278).\nDiscussion\nWith more than twice as many studies available com-\npared to our earlier meta-analysis [5], smoking remains\na risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression, with\nsmokers having 1.59 times the odds of progression in\nCOVID-19 severity than non-smokers (Fig. 1). The risk\nof smoking on COVID-19 disease progression was not\nchanged\nsignificantly\nby\nadjusting\nfor\nconfounders,\nwhich suggests that smoking is an independent risk of\nCOVID-19 progression. We also find that smokers are\nat increased risk of death from COVID-19 (Fig. A3).\nThese findings are not surprising because the well-\nestablished evidence that smoking is associated with a\nhigher risk of viral infection [3]. In the past pandemics\nsuch as influenza [3] and Cov-MERS [57] smoking is\nalso among leading risk factors for worse outcomes.\nAlthough the studies included in our paper (published\nas of May 25, 2020) reflect the first wave of COVID-19\npandemic, our results (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.33–1.89, p =\n0.001) are consistent with a meta-analyses published\nafter our paper was submitted in September 2020 based\non 109 studies from when the pandemic started [58] to\nFebruary 2021 (1.55, 95% CI 1.41–1.71) [59]. Our finding\nof a higher OR for former than current smokers is also\nconsistent with other analyses published after our paper\nwas submitted [58, 59].\nYounger smokers appear to have a higher risk of\nCOVID-19 disease progression than older smokers (Fig.\n2). A recent study also found that younger adults are\nmore medically vulnerable to severe COVID-19 illness if\nthey are smokers [60]. The greater effect of smoking\namong young people is particularly important because in\nthe U.S., almost 40% of COVID-19 patients are aged 18–\n44 years [61], and in China, 44% of COVID-19 patients\nare adults aged 20–49 years [62]. Even so, younger adults\ntend\nto\nperceiving\nlesser\ninfection-fatality\nrisks\nof\nCOVID-19 [63] so that they are less likely to protect\nthemselves from the infection. Our finding is consistent\nwith a recent meta-analysis study [64] which concluded\nthat age was negatively significantly associated with the\neffect of smoking on COVID-19 disease severity.\nWhile there is not yet direct peer reviewed evidence of\nthe effect of e-cigarette use on COVID-19 risk, the fact\nthat e-cigarettes have similar adverse effects on pulmon-\nary immune function [65] combined with the fact that e-\ncigarette use is concentrated among younger people,\nraises concerns and points to the need to collect data on\ne-cigarette use and COVID-19 risk.\nSome have argued that smoking has a protective effect\nagainst COVID-19 because of the low smoking preva-\nlence of reported among COVID patients [66–68]. This\nis not new. There were also rumors that smoking\nFig. 2 As the mean or median age of patients in a study falls the odds of COVID-19 progression increases. Solid line fit using a locally weighted\nregession and smoothing\nPatanavanich and Glantz BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1554 \nPage 5 of 9\nprotected patients from developing Cov-SARS during\nthe 2003 pandemic [69]. However, a case-control study\nof 447 patients showed that smoking did not protect pa-\ntients from contracting Cov-SARS after adjusting for\nconfounding by age, gender, contact history, and occu-\npation [69].\nReported smoking prevalence in the 33 studies in\nChina ranged from 1.4 to 29.8% (median = 7.3%), which\nwas substantially lower than 27.7% (52.1% for men and\n2.7% for women) smoking prevalence in 2015 [70]. Four\nstudies [10, 15, 17, 35] in the U.S. that reported the\nsmoking prevalence among current smokers ranged\nfrom 1.3 to 33.3% (median = 5.2%), which was also lower\nthan 13.7% (15.6% for men and 12.0% for women) smok-\ning prevalence in 2018 [71]. The other 4 studies [9, 23,\n26, 34] in the U.S. reported the ever-smoking prevalence\nranged from 13.3–33.5%, which was also lower than\n41.9% (47.2% for men and 37.3% for women) in 2017\n[72]. One study [37] in Italy reported the smoking preva-\nlence among current smokers of 3.2%, which was also\nsubstantial lower than 21.1% (26% for men and 17.2%\nfor women) in 2016 [73]. The remaining studies that re-\nported the ever-smoking prevalence (2 studies [16, 33]\nin Italy, 1 study [8] in UK and 1 study [25] in South\nKorea) were also lower than the countries’ rates (Italy:\n16.7–30% vs.43.9% (50% for men and 38.3% for women)\nin 2010 [74]; UK: 16.7% vs. 40.2 (44.3% for men and\n36.5% for women) in 2018 [75]; South Korea: 18.5%\nvs.39.1% (81.6% for men and 6.9% for women) in 2015\n[76]). These low levels of reported smoking among\nCOVID-19 patients may reflect the difficulty of obtain-\ning accurate smoking histories among seriously ill pa-\ntients,\nespecially\nwhen\nmost\nmedical\nfacilities\nare\noperating at or above normal capacity. Despite the fact\nthat the reported levels of smoking have been below\npopulation prevalences; however, the reported smoking\nprevalence among people with worse outcomes was sig-\nnificantly higher than those with less severe outcomes\n(16.1% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.023).\nLimitations\nThe studies used a variety of clinical definitions of\ndisease progression and smoking status (Table A1).\n(This is a common practical problem when conduct-\ning meta-analyses.) The varying definitions of disease\nprogression include severity of disease based on clin-\nical manifestations, development to more severe con-\nditions,\nincreasing\noxygen\nsupplements,\nprolonged\nviral shredding, organ injuries, ICU admission, and\ndeath. These varying definitions likely introduced in-\ncreased variance in the pooled risk estimates and\nprobably accounts for at least some of the heterogen-\neity between studies that was observed.\nHowever, smoking was significantly associated with\ndeath – a clearly defined endpoint – in the 7 studies [12,\n16, 26, 33, 34, 45, 54] that used this endpoint.\nMost studies reported smoking status as having a\nsmoking history, often without clearly stating how they\ncategorized former smokers. Of the 46 studies we\nreviewed, only 7 [10, 12, 18, 27, 35, 37, 50] reported all\nthree smoking categories (current, former, and never\nsmokers). A meta-analysis of these studies found that\ncurrent smoking was associated with a similar increase\nin the point estimate for the odds of disease progression\n(OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.83–2.22; Fig. A4) as the other studies\n(OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.24–1.91), but the odds for current\nsmoking did not reach conventional statistical signifi-\ncance (p = 0.202).\nStudies that only describe patient smoking history as\n“smoking history” or “history of smoking” do not pro-\nvide enough information to analyze smoking as a risk\nfactor given the fact that time since quitting could have\nsignificant influence on the patient’s outcomes.\nWhen estimating adjusted ORs, it is important to have\nan appropriately specified model. The studies that re-\nported adjusted odds ratios accounted for a variety of\ncovariates (Table A1), which means that the resulting\nORs are not strictly comparable [77]. (This is another\ncommonly-encountered problem in conducing meta-\nanalyses.)\nAll these limitations add to misclassification errors,\nwhich tend to bias results toward the null, suggest that\nthis analysis underestimates the risk of smoking in terms\nof increasing COVID-19 severity.\nThe effects of smoking on COVID-19 disease progres-\nsion by age reported in our paper is limited to the mean\nor median age in the studies. Individual level data on\nsmoking, age, e-cigarette use, demographics and other\nrisk factors are needed to perform a more sophisticated\nanalysis. In addition, most of the studies were retro-\nspective cohorts or case series, there might be recall bias,\nand could not conclude a causal relationship. Most of\nthe meta-analyses in this study had moderate and statis-\ntically significant heterogeneity; the reliability of the\nmeta-analyses might be compromised.\nConclusions\nSmoking is an independent risk associated with severe\nprogression of COVID-19, including mortality. The ef-\nfects seem to be larger among younger adults. Smoking\nprevention and cessation should remain a priority for\nthe public, physicians, and public health professionals\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; CI: Confidence interval; OR: Odds ratio;\nICU: Intensive care unit\nPatanavanich and Glantz BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1554 \nPage 6 of 9\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12889-021-11579-x.\nAdditional file 1.

A US study conducted on \n10 April 2020 found that among smokers who \nboth smoked and vaped, 28% decreased while 30% \nincreased their smoking2. A French study conducted \nbetween 30 March and 1 April 2020 found that \n19% of smokers decreased their smoking and 27% \nincreased their smoking3. Research shows that 3.3% \nof Italian smokers quit smoking during lockdown4. \nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION Although recent research shows that smokers respond differently to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, it offers little explanation of why some have increased \ntheir smoking, while others decreased it. In this study, we examined a possible \nexplanation for these different responses: pandemic-related stress.\nMETHODS We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of Dutch \ncurrent smokers from 11–18 May 2020 (n=957). During that period, COVID-19 \nwas six weeks past the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the Netherlands. \nIncluded in the survey were measures of how the COVID-19 pandemic had \nchanged their smoking, if at all (no change, increased smoking, decreased \nsmoking), and a measure of stress due to COVID-19.\nRESULTS Overall, while 14.1% of smokers reported smoking less due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, 18.9% of smokers reported smoking more. A multinomial \nlogistic regression analysis revealed that there was a dose-response effect of stress: \nsmokers who were somewhat stressed were more likely to have either increased \n(OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.49–3.78) or reduced (OR=1.80; 95% CI: 1.07–3.05) their \nsmoking. Severely stressed smokers were even more likely to have either increased \n(OR=3.75; 95% CI: 1.84–7.64) or reduced (OR=3.97; 95% CI: 1.70–9.28) their \nsmoking. Thus, stress was associated with both increased and reduced smoking, \nindependently from perceived difficulty of quitting and level of motivation to quit. \nCONCLUSIONS Stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic appears to affect smokers \nin different ways, some smokers increase their smoking while others decrease it. \nWhile boredom and restrictions in movement might have stimulated smoking, the \nthreat of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill might have motivated \nothers to improve their health by quitting smoking. These data highlight the \nimportance of providing greater resources for cessation services and the \nimportance of creating public campaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic \ntime.\nAFFILIATION\n1 The Netherlands Expertise \nCentre for Tobacco Control, \nTrimbos Institute, Utrecht, The \nNetherlands\n2 Tobacco Research \nand Treatment Center, \nMassachusetts General \nHospital, Boston, United \nStates\n3 Department of Health \nPromotion, Maastricht \nUniversity, Maastricht, The \nNetherlands\n4 Department of Psychology, \nUniversity of Waterloo, \nWaterloo, Canada\n5 School of Public Health and \nHealth Systems, University of \nWaterloo, Waterloo, Canada\n6 Ontario Institute for Cancer \nResearch, Toronto, Canada\nCORRESPONDENCE TO\nJeroen Bommelé.

Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):63\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/125580\n2\nIn Poland, 45.2% smokers increased their smoking, \n40.0% reported no change, and 14.8 % were unsure \nif their smoking had changed5. A Spanish study \nreported a non-significant decrease in current \nsmoking prevalence after confinement measures went \nin effect6.\nAlthough these studies show that smokers \nrespond differently to the pandemic, they offer little \nexplanation of why some have increased their smoking, \nwhile others decreased it. In this study, we examined \na possible explanation for this. As past research has \nshown that stress during the pandemic might be \nassociated with increase smoking7, we investigated \nthe possible role of stress in the pandemic’s impact \non this group8.\nMETHODS \nWe conducted an online survey among a representative \nsample of Dutch current smokers from 11–18 May \n2020. During that period, COVID-19 was six weeks \npast the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the \nNetherlands. On 11 May 2020, the Dutch government \nrelaxed protection measures by allowing primary \nschools, libraries, and some small businesses, to re-\nopen9.\nParticipants were recruited via an online panel \n(I&O Research). This panel invited 5275 potential \nrespondents, of which 2233 completed the screener. \nOf those, 1067 were eligible for our study (i.e. were \ncurrent smokers or former smokers who quit smoking \nin the last year). We analyzed the data of the 975 \ncurrent smokers in SPSS 25. \nWe conducted a multinomial logistic regression \nwith change in smoking as dependent variable, using \n‘no change’ as a reference category. We included \nperceived stress due to the pandemic, perceived \ndifficulty of quitting due to the pandemic, and \nmotivation to quit due to the pandemic as predictor \nvariables. All predictors had ‘no change’ as reference \ncategory. Finally, we added sex, age, education, and \nnicotine dependence (Heaviness of Smoking Index) \nas confounding variables. The Heaviness of Smoking \nIndex (HSI) is a composite measure of nicotine \ndependence that combines cigarettes smoked per day \nand time to first cigarette of the day. Higher values of \nthe HSI reflect a greater number of cigarettes smoked \nand/or a shorter time to first cigarette smoked10.\nOur survey included items from the Coronavirus \nModule of the International Tobacco Control Policy \nEvaluation (ITC) Project surveys being conducted in \na number of countries11,12. The Central Committee \non Research Involving Human Subjects in the \nNetherlands does not require approval from an ethical \nreview committee for non-medical survey research. \nAll respondents signed an informed consent form. \nRESULTS\nThe sample of 957 current smokers had a mean age \nof 45.9 years (SD=16.4), and 43.9% were women. \nRespondents smoked an average of 10.1 cigarettes \nper day (SD=7.6) and had an average Heaviness of \nSmoking Index score of 1.5 (SD=1.5). While 11.9% \nused e-cigarettes regularly, 6.4% used them every day. \nOverall, 14.1% of smokers reported smoking less \nand 18.9% reported smoking more due to COVID-19. \nMost frequently reported reasons for smoking less \nwere: living a healthier life (32.3%), being alone \nmore (27.0%), having healthier lungs (20.7%), and \nbeing healthier to help with recovery from a potential \ncoronavirus infection (19.4%). Reasons for smoking \nmore were boredom (48.6%), feeling more stressed \n(43.2%), being alone more (36.6%), and visiting fewer \nplaces where smoking is banned (23.5%).\nFurther, 24.7% of current smokers believed \nquitting smoking had become more difficult, while \n6.4% reported it had become easier since COVID-19. \nOf current smokers, 16.1% reported being more \nmotivated to quit, while 12.1% reported being less \nmotivated. Further, 50.0% of current smokers reported \nno stress, 40.1% reported being somewhat stressed, \nand 9.9% reported being severely stressed as a result \nof COVID-19. \nA multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed \nthat stress was associated with both increased and \nreduced smoking, independently from perceived \ndifficulty of quitting and motivation to quit (Table \n1). Smokers who were somewhat stressed were more \nlikely to have either increased (OR=2.37; 95% CI: \n1.49–3.78; p<0.001) or reduced (OR=1.80; 95% \nCI: 1.07–3.05; p=0.027) their smoking. Severely \nstressed smokers were even more likely to have either \nincreased (OR=3.75; 95% CI: 1.84–7.64; p<0.001) \nor reduced (OR=3.97; 95% CI: 1.70–9.28; p<0.001) \ntheir smoking. Stress thus appears to affect smokers in \ndifferent ways; some smokers increase their smoking \nwhile others decrease it. \nShort Report\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):63\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/125580\n3\nSmokers who reported less difficulty in quitting \nwere more likely to reduce smoking (OR=10.94; \n95% CI: 2.93–24.30; p<0.001) while those reporting \ngreater difficulty were more likely to increase smoking \n(OR=3.67; 95% CI: 2.28–5.89; p<0.001). Similarly, \nthose who reported greater motivation to quit were \nmore likely to reduce smoking (OR=4.57; 95% CI: \n2.53–8.25; p<0.001), and those who reported lower \nmotivation were more likely to increase smoking \n(OR=5.03; 95% CI: 2.74–9.24; p=0.001). There was \none somewhat unexpected finding: lower motivation \nto quit was also associated with a greater likelihood \nof reducing smoking (OR=4.26; 95% CI: 1.87–9.70; \np<0.001).\nDISCUSSION\nConsistent with previous research2,3, more current \nsmokers reported having increased rather than \ndecreased their smoking due to COVID-19. Our \nresults suggest that pandemic-related stress is \nassociated with increasing and decreasing smoking. \nWhile stress generally makes quitting more difficult13, \nstress resulting from COVID-19 has a mixed effect on \nmotivation to quit. For some, boredom and restrictions \nin movement might have stimulated smoking5. For \nothers, concern about contracting COVID-19 and \nbecoming severely ill might have motivated them to \nimprove their health by stopping smoking14.\nLess difficulty in quitting and greater motivation to \nquit were significantly related to smoking reductions \ndue to COVID-19. This highlights the importance \nof providing greater resources for cessation support \nservices15, which are expected to see more smokers \nwith high levels of stress. Indeed, the mounting \nevidence that smoking is related to severity of \nCOVID-19 illness1 could provide greater motivation \nfor smokers to quit. Quitting would potentially \nhelp tackling not only smoking-related chronic \ndiseases but also the new infectious-disease threat \nof COVID-1916.\nWhile greater motivation to quit was related to \nreductions in smoking as expected, so was lower \nmotivation to quit. One possible explanation is that \nsmokers who had reduced their smoking believed \nthat they had already done enough to reduce their \nrisk, and thus had lower motivation to take that more \ndifficult step of quitting altogether. Another possible \nexplanation is that some smokers have reduced their \nsmoking due to fewer social activities, and not because \nthey are motivated to reduce or quit their smoking. \nThe coronavirus confinement measures have limited \nsocial smoking (i.e. smoking with friends, at parties, or \nwhen going out). As a result, some smokers may have \nreduced their smoking without it being a motivated \ndecision.\nLimitations\nA possible limitation of our study is that since our \nsample did not include recent quitters, we cannot \nestimate the possible impact of the pandemic on \nTable 1.

Our findings apply \nto smokers who continued smoking during the \npandemic; this limitation also applies to other recent \ncross-sectional surveys on COVID-19 and smoking2,3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSmokers appear to be affected by stress related to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic in different ways: some \nsmokers are smoking more, while others are smoking \nless. While boredom and restrictions in movement \nmight have stimulated smoking, the concern about \ncontracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill \nmight have motivated others to improve their health \nby quitting smoking. This highlights the importance \nof providing greater resources for cessation support \nservices and the importance of creating public \ncampaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic time. \nREFERENCES\n1. \t Alqahtani JS, Oyelade T, Aldhahir AM, et al.

This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/\n139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The cal-\nculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03–2.04] to\nhave severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also\nhad a higher mortality rate of 38.5%.\nConclusion\nAlthough COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infec-\ntion was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to for-\nmer and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and\nhigher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk\nin COPD patients and current smokers.\nImpact\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies including a total of 2473 confirmed\nCOVID-19 patients, COVID-19 was associated with greater severity and mortality in COPD\npatients and current smokers. Despite the low prevalence of COPD and smoking in COVID-\n19 cases, this result emphasizes attention to effective preventive measures to support reducing\nthe burden of COVID-19 in these vulnerable populations. This has the potential to improve\noutcomes for patients and lessen the burden on health services.\nIntroduction\nThe emergence in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China of a novel pneumonia of unknown\norigin on the 31st of December, 2019 was the start of an outbreak which would later be\ndeclared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. The name COVID-19\n(acronym for “coronavirus disease 2019”) was coined on the 11th of February 2020 to describe\npresentation with severe acute respiratory disease [2]. COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of\ncoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus\nbelongs to the family of single stranded RNA viruses some of which have been previously\ndescribed to be responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle\nEast Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [3, 4]. Although the symptoms and clinical presentation\nof COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS, the rate of spread is greater [5]. As of 25th of\nMarch 2020, the total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 stands at 459,419 with 20,818\ndeaths globally and the number is projected to increase [6].\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, persistent and preventable\ndysfunction of the lung associated with limitation in airflow. COPD is a complex disease asso-\nciated with abnormalities of the airway and/ or alveoli which is predominantly caused by expo-\nsure to noxious gases and particulates over a long period [7]. With a global prevalence of 251\nmillion cases in 2016, and 3.17 million (5%) deaths in 2015 alone, COPD was ranked by the\nWHO as the third leading cause of death especially with a particular burden in low- and mid-\ndle-income countries [8, 9]. This burden is predicted to grow due mainly to increased global\nexposure to tobacco, aging populations, poor awareness and inadequate access to diagnosis\n[10]. COPD exacerbations are a major event in the natural history of the disease associated\nPLOS ONE\nCOPD and Smoking in pandemic COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147\nMay 11, 2020\n2 / 13\nwith worsening of symptoms often resulting in hospitalization and poor prognosis [11]. Vari-\nous factors have been described to contribute to acute worsening of COPD, however, viral\ninfection remains the main trigger, including seasonal coronaviruses [12–14].\nSince the emergence of COVID-19, scientists around the world continue to better under-\nstand the clinical, diagnostic and prognostic characteristic of the disease. While over 150\npapers, editorials and comments have been written about COVID-19 as of 24th of March 2020,\nthere is none dedicated to the specific risk posed to patients with a previous history of COPD.\nThis review addresses this gap in knowledge with the aim of assisting clinicians to assess the\nprognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with COPD and those with smoking history.\nMethods\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting in System-\natic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [15]. We prospectively registered this\nreview to Prospero (registration number is: CRD42020175518).\nWe searched MEDLINE and Google scholar from inception date to March 16, 2020. The\nsearch was updated on March 24, 2020. We used an extensive search strategy developed by a\nspecilaised librarian for retrieving this type of evidence, which included the reference list of eli-\ngible papers and published pre-print papers (see S1 Table in S1 Appendix). All retrieved stud-\nies were exported into EndNote to remove duplicates. The remaining studies were exported to\nRayyan software for title, abstracts and full text screening by two independent reviewers.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nEligible studies were those that investigated: epidiomolgical, clinical charcterstics and features\nof COVID-19 and prevelance of chronic diseases specifically COPD in their analysis. We\nexcluded the following: studies that did not report COPD, studies that included respiratory\ndiseases but did not specifically analyze COPD, only children, editorials, correspondence let-\nters, reviews, qualitative studies, theses, non-English language and non-full text articles.\nData collection\nTwo authors (JSA and TO) independently screened titles and abstracts of potential studies and\nconflicts were resolved through discussion between the two. Full-text articles of potential stud-\nies were then independently read by two authors (JSA and TO) to identify studies meeting the\ninclusion criteria. The reference lists from all identified studies and reviews were scrutinized\nfor eligible articles. Disagreement on selected papers was resolved through discussion with a\nthird author (AA).\nQuality assessment\nTwo authers independently evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using a\nmodified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [16]. It includes seven domains, each\none of these domains was scored from 0 (high risk of bias) to 3 (low risk of bias) and we took a\nmean of the domains to result in a score between 0 and 3, where a higher score represents a\nlower risk of bias. Any disagreement in the quality assessment was resolved by discussion with\na third author.\nData synthesis\nWe completed meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence of COPD and current smokers\namong those patients with confrmed COVID-19. The output was generated using the Stata\nPLOS ONE\nCOPD and Smoking in pandemic COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147\nMay 11, 2020\n3 / 13\nprocedure Metaprop. Owing to heterogeneity within and between studies, we used the ran-\ndom-effects model in Stata/SE 15. Data were displayed using forest plots. We examined\nbetween-study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. A narrative synthesis of the results was con-\nducted considering the prevalence, disease severity and mortality among COVID-19 COPD\npatients and smoking status. We defined COVID-19 severity as those who were admitted to\nintensive care unit (ICU), had severe, oxygenation, needed mechanical ventilation or death.\nSince our meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and not assessing\ntreatment effects, the assessment for potential risk of bias that could affect the results was not\nindicated.\nPre-print\nAs this is a rapidly evolving area, we also searched pre-print literature and whilst not incorpo-\nrating such data in the formal analysis, provide narrative synthesis where such pre-print data\nare relevant to our main findings.\nResults\nAn initial search generated 123 potentially relevant papers, of which two were immediately\nexcluded due to duplication. After the first screening of title and abstracts, 61 papers were\npotentially relevant according to the inclusion criteria. An additional 46 papers were excluded\nafter full-text review, which resulted in 15 studies that satisfied all criteria. The reference list of\nthe relevant papers was also examined (see Fig 1, PRISMA flow diagram).\nDescription of included studies\nA summary of the included studies is presented in Table 1, which included a total of 2473 con-\nfirmed COVID-19 patients. Of those patients, only 58 (2.3%) had COPD as a comorbidity.\nThe sample size of the included studies ranged from 21 to 1099 patients. Most of the studies\nFig 1.

The overall crude mortality rate for COVID-19 was 7.4%\n(184/2473). There were no reports of the baseline characteristics of the 58 COPD patients that\ndescribed their age, or severity of COPD airflow limitation. Smoking status was reported in\neight studies, in which 193 confirmed COVID-19 cases were current smokers.\nPrevalence of COPD in confirmed COVID-19 cases\nThe pooled prevalence of COVID-19 patients who had COPD from all studies was 2% (95%\nCI, 1%–3%), Fig 2. The overall I2 was 41.90%, p 0.04.\nDisease severity and mortality among COVID-19 COPD patients\nSeven studies that included 35 COPD patients reported COVID severity in their analysis. With\n63% (22/35) patient reported as severe compared to 37% (13/35) non-severe, this shows that\nCOPD patients are at a higher risk of more severe COVID-2019 compared to patients without\nCOPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4–2.4)]. Data from two studies [28,\n30] including COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 demonstrate 60% (6/10) mortality\nrate compared to mortality rate in patients without COPD 55% (86/157), [calculated RR, 1.10\n(95% CI, 0.6–1.8)].\nSmoking history and risk of COVID-2019\nSmoking exposure including (current and ex-smokers) was reported in eight studies, with 221\nconfirmed COVID-19 cases. We assessed the prevalence of current smokers in all studies\nusing meta-analysis of proportions of current smokers that had confirmed COVID-19. There\nwas a pooled prevalence of 9%, (95% CI, 4%–14%), Fig 3. The overall I2 was 92.49%, p 0.00.\nIndeed, 22.30% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe com-\nplications. Calculating the RR from these two studies showed that current smokers (31/108)\nwere 1.45 times more likely [RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03–2.04] to have severe complications com-\npared to former and never smokers (147/808) patients [18, 29]. A higher mortality rate of\n38.5% (5/13) was also seen among current smokers.\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to develop\nan informed understanding of the prevalence, severity and mortality of COPD patients\nTable 1.

We provide an updated report in relation to smokers [32]. Our\nmain outcomes show that the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was low, but that\nthe risk of severity (63%) and mortality (60%) were high, which indicates COPD patients with\nconfirmed COVID-19 are at a greater risk of severe complications and death. Furthermore,\nthe prevalence of current smokers in COVID-19 patients was 9% (95% CI, 4%–14%), and this\nwas also associated with greater severity (22.30%) and mortality (38.5%).\nWe report a low prevalence of COPD patients in COVID-19 case series compared to the lat-\nest COPD prevalence rate in China, which was 13.6% (95% CI 12\u00010–15\u00012) and the global preva-\nlence of COPD (9–10%) [33, 34]. There was a low heterogeneity among the studies, which was\n41.90%, p 0.04. This is expected since clinical and methodological diversity always occur in a\nmeta-analysis. We speculate that patients may have not been diagnosed. Having a reliable esti-\nmate of the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 cases, and likely outcomes, is crucial to ensure\nspecific successful global preventive and treatment strategies for COPD patients. Bearing this\nin mind, in the included studies there was no report on COPD severity data and COPD-related\ncomorbidities, which prevents us from assessing the impact of such essential information.\nAlthough the COPD prevalence was not high in the included confirmed COVID-19 cases,\nCOVID-19 causes a substantial burden on COPD patients with increased disease severity. This\nFig 2. Pooled prevalence of COPD with confirmed COVID-19, (ES: Effect size).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147.g002\nPLOS ONE\nCOPD and Smoking in pandemic COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147\nMay 11, 2020\n7 / 13\nsummary agrees with other results currently available only in pre-print [35, 36]. Viral infec-\ntions in COPD patients increase systemic inflammation with slow recovery of reported symp-\ntoms [37, 38]. In addition to the effects of COVID-19, patients with COPD have various\ncomorbidities, some of which are associated with increased risk of hospitalization [39–41].\nAccording to recent systematic reviews, the prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients\nwas high and these comorbidities were associated with increased disease severity [42, 43].\nMost of the studies that reported COPD severity defined severe cases as those who were admit-\nted to intensive care unit (ICU), had severe oxygenation, needed mechanical ventilation or\ndeath [18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 29]. These studies did not give details about the underlying COPD. It\nwould have been interesting to know if the frequency of previous exacerbations was linked to\nincreased complications in COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In general, those with\nsevere case of COVID-19 were older and had more coexisting comorbidities than those with\nmild illness.\nData from two studies [28, 30] describing COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 show\na higher mortality rate at 60%. This concurs with pre-print studies that found similarly high\nmortality rates [35, 44–47]. Despite the small number of patients that were analyzed, this\nincreases concerns about the prognosis of this vulnerable population. However, this high\nFig 3. Pooled prevalence of current smokers with confirmed COVID-19, (ES: Effect size).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147.g003\nPLOS ONE\nCOPD and Smoking in pandemic COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147\nMay 11, 2020\n8 / 13\nmortality rate could be attributed to several factors. The majority of COPD patients have vari-\nous comorbidities that may also be associated with mortality and related conditions may have\nbeen underreported because of the difficulties finding the specific cause of mortality [48].\nMoreover, in patients with severe COPD, respiratory failure is the principal cause of mortality\nand this demands ICU intervention. It is possible that limited access to respiratory support as\npart of COVID-19 management may be contributing to this mortality, dependent on critical\ncare capacity in each hospital or region. According to a recent COVID-19 report from Italy,\nthe surge in patients requiring intensive care has been unmanageable, with 12% of positive\ncases requiring ICU admission [49], more than that reported in China [18, 28]. As a conse-\nquence, patients were dying because mechanical ventilation could not be offered, on top of\nacute shortage of clinicians who were able to manage those patients [50, 51]. Until now, the\nparticular mechanisms of how COVID-19 increases COPD severity and mortality is unknown,\nand undoubtedly more research is needed to find the possible mechanisms that linked COVD-\n19 and increased severity and mortality of COPD patients.\nConcerning smoking and COVID-19, our data showed a pooled prevalence of 9% current\nsmokers, (95% CI, 4%–14%), lower than the reported prevalence of smoking in China that was\n25.2% (25.1–25.4) [52]. The overall I2 was 92.49% among the studies, which indicates consider-\nable heterogeneity. However, this was address by using random effect model to incorporate\nbetween-study variability of effect sizes. Such heterogeneity is expected due to different study\ndesigns, regions and outcomes. Interestingly, we found that 22.30% (31/139) of current smok-\ners and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications associated and greater mortality\nreaching 38.5% in current smokers. The calculated RR from two studies showed that current\nsmokers were 1.45 times more likely [RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03–2.04] to have severe complica-\ntions compared to former and never smokers [18, 29]. The impact of smoking history on vul-\nnerability to COVID-19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of\ntobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID-19. A recent systematic review\non COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associ-\nated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more\ndetail due to limited studies [32]. Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial\nvirus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral\nrespiratory tract infections [53]. It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this preva-\nlence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-\n2) (pre-print) [54]. However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts\nbecome available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked\nto how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups [55].\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically evaluate existing literature\nwith a focus on risk of COVID-19 on COPD. For the first time, we conducted a meta-analysis\nusing a random effects model to calculate the pooled prevalence of COPD in confirmed\nCOVID-19 and examined outcomes. This increased the generalizability of our findings, as het-\nerogeneity was addressed by incorporating between-study variability of effect sizes. We\nshowed that COPD and smoking in COVID-19 is associated with greater disease severity and\nhigher mortality. This review has some limitations. Few studies were eligible for inclusion and\nmost of them come from China. Second, heterogeneity exists in location, setting, and design.\nThe reported clinical characteristics were not available in most of the studies at the time of\nanalyses. This work has a number of clinical and research implications. It highlights the global\nprevalence and the clinical effects of COVID-19 on COPD patients and smokers. As COPD\npatients are at an increased risk of severe outcomes if they became infected with COVID-19, it\nis recommended that patients and clinicians establish effective plans for ensuring prevention,\nsuch as using tele-medicine to ensure that COPD receive the best care [56, 57]. We strongly\nPLOS ONE\nCOPD and Smoking in pandemic COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233147\nMay 11, 2020\n9 / 13\nadvocate public awareness campaigns concentrating on ways to achieve smoking cessation\namong smokers, and it is possible that an improvement in cessation rates will help to reduce\nthe spread of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms between COPD,\nsmoking and COVID-19 infection.\nConclusion\nThough COPD prevalence in reported COVID-19 cases is low, COVID-19 infection is associ-\nated with significant severity and mortality in COPD. There was also increased risk of severe\ndisease and mortality in current smokers. Effective preventive measures are urgently required\nto reduce COVID-19 risk on COPD patients and current smokers.\nSupporting information\nS1 Appendix.\n(DOCX)\nS1 Checklist.

  "hpr-8-1-9124.pdf": "Abstract \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, about 60 million of Italians\nstayed at home. These circumstances may generate exceptional\nchallenges and stress for people who regularly use cigarettes, e-\ncigarettes, heated tobacco products, dual users, former smokers and\nnever smokers. Here, we present results from a study that was\naimed at surveying smoking behaviour and psychological dynamics\nduring the Italian COVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home\npolicies. Participants living in Italy were invited to complete an\nonline brief questionnaire. A questionnaire was prepared and\nuploaded in an online survey tool. They were asked to participate\nregardless of their current smoking status and were divided in seven\nsubgroups. In total, 1825 participants were included in the analysis.\nExclusive cigarette smokers; Dual users of cigarette and e-\ncigarettes; Dual users of cigarette and heated tobacco products;\nFormer smokers; Exclusive users of e-cigarette; Exclusive users of\nheated tobacco products; never smoker. Dual users of cigarette and\ne-cigarette and exclusive cigarette smokers perceived that their\ndaily consumption has slightly decreased. Exclusive cigarette\nsmokers and exclusive e-cigarette users changed the way of\npurchasing products. Most exclusive cigarette smokers have\nconsidered quitting but most exclusive e-cigarette users have not\nconsidered stopping the use of e-cigarettes. In former smokers’\ngroup, about one third of participants declared thoughts about\nstarting to smoke again and in never smokers’ group few\nparticipants declared intention to start smoking. The COVID-19 era\ncould be considered a “transition” phase and as such requires a\nsearch for a new balance. These changes in everyday habits can be\na significant moment to use established and emerging strategies to\ncreate a definitive smoke-free world.\nIntroduction\nOn March 11, 2020, WHO declared Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nto be a pandemic. Italy was soon one of the most affected countries.\nFrom the patient 0 identified on 21 February, the peninsula has\nrecorded new cases daily, which have also been followed by several\ndeaths. To try to contain and manage the spread of the\nepidemiological emergency, Italy, later followed by many other\ncountries, announced a lock-down. Domestic confinement and the\nclosure of schools, restaurants, sports and recreational activities,\nshops and many offices were ordered, as well as important\nlimitations in movements and social interactions, causing a huge\nchange in the quality of life of the entire population (Matias et al.,\n2020). Some recent studies on the psychological and behavioral\neffects of confinement highlight the emergence in the population\nof disorders ranging from panic, phobia, health anxiety, sleep\ndisturbances to dissociative symptoms (Banerjee, 2020; Lima et\nal., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The psychological effects of\nconfinement seem to increase with each passing day (García-\nÁlvarez et al., 2020) and in particular this has been found in some\ngroups of the population, such as healthcare personnel (Bai et al.,\n2004; Maunder et al., 2003), or in vulnerable people with previous\nCorrespondence: Pasquale Caponnetto, Department of Clinical and\nExperimental Medicine, University of Catania, Italy.\nTel.: +39-095-378-1583.\nE-mail: p.caponnetto@unict.it\nKey words: Smoking; vaping; electronic cigarette; vape shop; heated\ntobacco products; COVID-19.\nAcknowledgements: The authors would like to thank the Italian anti-\nsmoking League (LIAF) and Dr.ssa Valeria Nicolosi for promoting the\nsurvey and encouraging people to participate.

Furthermore, it emerges how such\nisolation measures can have a significant impact on the increased\nrisk of suicide (Reger, Stanley, & Joiner, 2020). Addicted persons\nalso represent a population at risk and mental health experts report\nthe possible effects of the pandemic on people who suffer or risk\ndeveloping an addiction (Pfefferbaum & Nord, 2020; Yao et al.,\n2020), and among these are those who experience nicotine or\ncannabinoid addiction. Despite this, individuals who are in a state\nof domestic isolation frequently continue to use the substances they\ndepend on to relieve stress and negative feelings (Volkow et al.,\n2020). The use of alcohol, tobacco and other substances can change\nnot only as a form of distraction or behavioral prevention strategy,\nbut also as a result of stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms\n(García-Álvarez et.al, 2020). For people engaged in a detoxification\nprocess, social support is essential, while social isolation is a risk\nfactor because stressful conditions may occur that exacerbate the\ndesire to consume, causing a greater risk of relapse (Kreek et al.,\n2005). Boredom and free time can also increase the risk of\nproblematic or extreme behavior, such as alcohol consumption and\ninternet addiction (Wang, 2019; Biolcati et al., 2018). A protracted\nperiod of isolation, without face-to-face contacts, and a lifestyle\nbased on the activities carried out through the use of technology,\nencourage the consolidation of negative habits that can lead to video\ngame addictions, compromising mental health, sleep-wake rhythms\nand/or physical health (King et al., 2020). \nAll these data show the importance of starting a research to find\nout how far a change in the consumption model of nicotine-\ncontaining products is taking place (new users, increase/decrease in\nfrequency, relapse, intensity of use, purchase management, intention\nto quit) as a result of emotional responses, as a moment for change,\nas an avoidance strategy or an alternative to confinement-related\nboredom and a pandemic, identifying the responses and strategies\ndeveloped as an alternative to the aforementioned factors. For these\nreasons and to better understand how nicotine and no nicotine\nconsumers coped during this crisis, the Center of Excellence for the\nacceleration of Harm Reduction (CoEHAR) carried out this research\nwith the aim of surveying smoking behaviour and psychological\ndynamics during the Italian COVID-19 social distancing and stay-\nat-home policies.\nMaterials and Methods \nA brief questionnaire was prepared by the COEHAR research\nteam and its presentation was uploaded in the Italian antismoking\nleague (LIAF) website (https://www.liaf-italia.it/sondaggio-covid-\n19/) together with informed consents in Italian. If the participant\nagreed with the informed consent, he/she was redirected to the\nquestionnaire. The informed consent presented the purpose of the\nsurvey, the names and contact details of the study investigators,\ninformation about who was eligible to take part and how survey data\nwere used, assurances of participant anonymity and confidentiality.\nSubsequently, participants were asked city of residence, age and\ngender. No financial or other incentive was offered in exchange for\nparticipation and no personal identifying details were collected. The\nquestionnaire was available online for 25 days (from 2 to 26 April\n2020). The study was approved by the IERB of the Department of\nEducation Sciences University of Catania. The study was conducted\nin agreement with the ethical norms set by the Italian National\nPsychological Association. \nThe questionnaire was communicated on internet social media\nand adults were asked to take part, regardless of current or previous\nsmoking status. The IP address of the participants was recorded in\norder to avoid double entries. Previous and contemporary smoking\nstatus was asked and, based on the latter, participants were divided\ninto seven groups for the analysis: Exclusive cigarette smokers\n(packaged or rolled); Dual users of cigarette and electronic cigarette;\nDual users of cigarette and heated tobacco products (e.g. IQOS or\nGLO); Former smokers (had smoked in the past but not now);\nExclusive users of electronic cigarette; Exclusive users of heated\ntobacco products (e.g. IQOS or GLO); Never smokers. The\nquestionnaire included questions about how had this stressful\nsituation impacted access and product use behavior among smokers,\nvapers, dual users, former smokers and never smokers. \nTo assess changes in consumption, the following questions were\nasked: “During this period of forced confinement due to the\ncoronavirus emergency, do you believe that you have increased or\ndecreased the number of cigarettes smoked per day?”; “During this\nperiod of forced confinement due to the coronavirus emergency, do\nyou believe that you have increased or decreased the number of\nliquid/cartridges?”; “During this period of forced confinement due\nto the coronavirus emergency, do you believe that you have\nincreased or decreased the number of heets/sticks?”. The answers\nwere scored as: 1, “Increased”; 2, “Decreased”; 3, “Stable”. \nTo examine the significant changes in the way of purchasing,\nthe following questions were asked: “During this period of forced\nconfinement due to the coronavirus emergency, how are you\nmanaging to purchase cigarettes?”; “During this period of forced\nconfinement due to the coronavirus emergency, how are you\nmanaging to purchase e-liquid/cartridges?”; “During this period of\nforced confinement due to the coronavirus emergency, how are you\nmanaging to purchase heets/sticks?”;. The answers were scored as:\n1, “As always 2, “It has changed (Please, describe how your way\nof buying cigarettes has changed)”.\nTo examine the thoughts about quitting, the following questions\nwere asked: “During this period of forced confinement due to the\ncoronavirus emergency, have you thought about quitting smoking\nor possible alternatives such as switching to the exclusive use of\nelectronic cigarettes or the exclusive use of heated tobacco products\n(e.g. IQOS or GLO)?; “During this period of forced confinement\ndue to the coronavirus emergency, have you thought about stopping\nusing the electronic cigarette?”; “During this period of forced\nconfinement due to the coronavirus emergency, have you thought\nabout stopping using the heated tobacco products?”; The answer\nwere scored as: 1, “No”; 2, “Yes”.\nTo examine the risk of relapse among former smokers and the\nrisk of starting smoking in those who had never smoked, the\nfollowing questions were asked: “During this period of forced\nconfinement due to the coronavirus emergency, have you thought\nabout starting to smoke again?”; “During the COVID-19 restriction\nperiod, did you think about starting to smoke?”; The answers for\nformer smokers were scored as: 1, “No”; 2, “Yes but I haven’t\nstarted smoking conventional cigarettes again”; 3, “Yes and I started\nsmoking conventional cigarettes again”; The answers for never\nsmokers were scored as: 1, “No”; 2, “Yes I thought about starting\nto smoke cigarettes”; 3, “Yes I thought about starting to smoke\nelectronic cigarettes”; 4, “Yes I thought about starting to smoke\nheated tobacco cigarettes (e.g. IQOS or GLO)”\nStatistical analysis \nParticipants were categorized according to their reported\nsmoking status at the time of participation to the survey. Results\nwere reported for the whole sample and for each of the subgroups.\n                                 [Health Psychology Research 2020; 8:9124]                                                   [page 69]\n                                                                                                                              Article\nThe sample size varied by variable because of missing data.\nKolmogorov-Smirnoff tests were performed to assess normality of\ndistribution of variables.

Former smokers were 16%\nand finally, exclusive user of heated tobacco products and exclusive\nuser of electronic cigarette were respectively 4.4% and 12.3%.\nChanges in consumption \nA chi-square test of independence showed that there was a\nsignificant association between “users group” variable and\ncategorial variable “During this period of forced confinement due\nto the coronavirus emergency, do you believe that you have\nincreased or decreased the consumption of [specific product]”, X2\n(4, N = 985) = 33.17, p = .001. Considering the standardized\nresidual values (sr), the “Dual users of combustible tobacco and\nEcig” and “Exclusive combustible tobacco users” reported a\nnegative sr value (-2.7 and -1.9) for “Stable” category; also\n“Exclusive Ecig users” reported a sr positive value of 4.9. For the\n“Down” category, we found a positive sr value of 2.9 for “Exclusive\ncombustible tobacco users” and a negative sr value (-5.7) for the\n“Exclusive Ecig users”. “Dual users of combustible tobacco and\nEcig” and “Exclusive combustible tobacco users” slightly decreased\nthe number of cigarettes or e-liquid and in comparison, to\npercentage values the “Exclusive Ecig users” had a stable level of\nconsumption (Table 2 and Figure 1).\nChanges in the way of purchasing\nA chi-square test of independence showed that there was a\nsignificant association between “users group” variable and\ncategorial variable “During this period of forced confinement due\nto the coronavirus emergency, how are you managing to purchase\n[specific product]”, X2 (4, N = 985) = 33.17, p=.001.

Significantly, exclusive combustible\ntobacco users were the ones who would mostly have liked to quit,\nbut those who smoke exclusively e-cigarettes were the ones who\ndidn’t want to quit (Table 4 and Figure 3). \nRisk of relapse for former smokers and the risk of\nstarting smoking for never smokers\nIn the “former smokers” group, we compared percentage value\nof response (Yes/No) to item “During this period of forced\nconfinement due to the coronavirus emergency, have you thought\nabout starting to smoke again?” and the participants showed a\npercentage value of “Yes, I thought of starting” of 29.7% (Figure\n4). Finally, in never smokers’ group we found that almost 2,3% of\nparticipants said they would start smoking by using cigarettes, 0.8%\ne-cigarette, 0% Heated Tobacco Product (HTP) and 97% said they\nwould not start smoking (Figure 5).\nDiscussion\nThis is the first survey that specifically focused on the\npsychological dynamics of smoking behavior during Italian\nCOVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home policies. A large\nnumber of smokers, never smokers, former smokers, vapers and\ndual users participated; This study focused on a careful observation\nof the types of tobacco-related products (cigarette, e-cigarette,\nheated tobacco and dual usage) inserted within the italian lockdown\nperiod. Within this time frame, it could be of interest to observe such\nbehaviour under a “psychological lens” that explains how and how\nmuch cigarette dependence or attachment to a low-risk product has\naffected the study participants’ behaviour (Baltes et al., 2009).

This aspect\nmay be linked to several factors including: 1) the lack of\nopportunities for smokers to live the usual habits related to the\nconsumption of cigarettes such as the cigarettes smoked during the\nItalian ritual of drinking coffee at a bar or while driving home/work\nor home/university and given that the majority of the participants\nwere young, it is likely that the perceived reduction in cigarette\nsmoking could be also attributable to the absence of daily\nsocialization in places of youth gathering (Mucci et al., 2020). If\nsuch habits that accurately marked the rhythms of the smoker’s life\nwere missed consequently an unintentional decrease in cigarette\nconsumption could be observed; 2) Another aspect to note is that of\nthe variation of the family lifestyle habits of each smoker; for\nexample, spending more time in the home with children or non-\nsmoking cohabiting partners has likely led people to slightly reduce\ntheir consumption of cigarettes in order to respect their family\nmembers (Thomer et al., 2019); 3) fear of COVID-19 development\nas coughing is common in both smoking and COVID-19 positives\n(Patanavanich & Glantz, 2020). However, if this data can only be\nlinked to traditional cigarette smokers, the same cannot be said for\nthose who use e-cigarettes, this category is not similarly linked to\ncertain “behavioral” patterns typical of cigarette smokers, so within\nthis survey there is a trend indicating a slight increase in daily\nconsumption among vapers during the lock-down period (Adriens\net al., 2018). The second data to be observed is that of how products\nare purchased. The data provided showed that there has been an\nincrease in the purchase of products such as cigarettes and e-liquids.\nThe response to this behaviour is dictated by the fact that during the\nlockdown most consumers of smoking products have likely\nexperienced states of anxiety and concern related to the possible\n“lack” of something considered “fundamental” (Lee, 2020). The\nanxieties related to the concern of being without basic necessities\nhas affected not only smokers but the entire population (Brooks et\nal., 2020). The supply of consumer goods for smokers can be\ncomparable to that of all citizens who poured outside every\nsupermarket trying in every way to stock up products such as yeast\nor flour, the “must” of quarantine. This element emerges from a\nrecent study that confirms how citizens around the world have\nbehaved in a “protective” way dictated by a sudden and most violent\nsense of frustration, sense of marked loneliness and the concern\nrelated to the fear of unavailability of essential products, each of\nthese sensations accompanied by a strong discomfort linked to the\nconstant fear of contagion (Troisi, 2020). Our sample is limited to\nthe Italian population and we observed a female and a young\npredominance in participation to this survey. Further studies are\nneeded to explore this phenomenon and define whether our study\nfindings will be confirmed or not. The survey was announced and\npromoted in popular websites. Therefore, it was expected that young\nusers able to use technology and social network with a not eradicate\ncigarette dependence would mainly participate, and the high\nproportion of young smokers and never smokers confirms this.\nHowever, it is important to consider that having information on\nsmoking behaviour of young people is important given that they\nrepresent the future of our society, since this can provide health\nofficials with information on how to disseminate health\nempowerment messages, especially during this sad period.\nTherefore, it would be realistic and valuable to create and\ndisseminate innovative and effective way of sustaining a healthy\nlifestyle by promoting smoking cessation for smokers, avoiding\nsmoking initiation for never smokers and relapse for former smokers\nand to properly inform the public that the moment of COVID-19 is\ncreating a land of psychological change where to sow seeds of\nhealth.\nConclusions \nThe COVID-19 era will be looked back into history as an era\ncharacterized by great upheaval that has upset every human rhythm\nand has not been experienced as a dive into the unknown, a feeling\nthat was replicated day after day. It can and should be considered a\n“transition” phase and as such requires a search for a new balance.\nWhat is certainly most encouraging from reading the research data\nis that those who have quit smoking before COVID-19 have not\nrelapsed thanks to their personal resilience and coping skills. The\nformer smokers interviewed found their comfort zone in the home\nduring this period, far from confrontation with others, thus not\nallowing the onset of psychological suffering related to the lack of\ncigarettes. These changes in everyday habits can be a significant\nmoment to use established and emerging strategies to create a\ndefinitive smoke-free world.\nReferences\nAdriaens, K., Van Gucht, D., Baeyens, F.

The impact of smoking on COVID‐19 severity has been previously re-\nported in several meta‐analyses limited by small sample sizes and poor methodology.\nWe aimed to rigorously and definitively quantify the effects of smoking on COVID‐19\nseverity. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched between\n1 December 2019 and 2 June 2020. Studies reporting smoking status of hospitalized\npatients with different severities of disease and/or at least one clinical endpoint of\ninterest (disease progression, intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical\nventilation, and mortality) were included. Data were pooled using a random‐effects\nmodel. This study was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42020180920. We analyzed 47\neligible studies reporting on 32 849 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients, with 8417\n(25.6%) reporting a smoking history, comprising 1501 current smokers, 5676 former\nsmokers, and 1240 unspecified smokers. Current smokers had an increased risk of\nsevere COVID‐19 (risk ratios [RR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14‐2.85;\nP = .012), and severe or critical COVID‐19 (RR: 1.98; CI: 1.16‐3.38; P = .012). Patients\nwith a smoking history had a significantly increased risk of severe COVID‐19 (RR:\n1.31; CI: 1.12‐1.54; P = .001), severe or critical COVID‐19 (RR: 1.35; CI: 1.19‐1.53;\nP < .0001), in‐hospital mortality (RR: 1.26; CI: 1.20‐1.32; P < .0001), disease progres-\nsion (RR: 2.18; CI: 1.06‐4.49; P = .035), and need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.20;\nCI: 1.01‐1.42; P = .043). Patients with any smoking history are vulnerable to severe\nCOVID‐19 and worse in‐hospital outcomes. In the absence of current targeted\ntherapies, preventative, and supportive strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality\nin current and former smokers are crucial.\nK E Y W O R D S\ncoronavirus, epidemiology, pandemics, pathogenesis, respiratory tract, virus classification,\nzoonoses\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided the original work is properly cited.\n© 2020 The Authors.

The articles ranged from critically poor to\nmoderate quality, indicating that significant methodological flaws in\ncritical domains exist with all six currently published reviews assessing\nthe impact of smoking on COVID‐19 severity. It is therefore likely that\nthe true effect of smoking on COVID‐19 severity reported in these\nanalyses is clouded by considerable bias.\nFurthermore, as a result of several nonpeer reviewed preprint ar-\nticles falsely equating the prevalence of smoking in COVID‐19 study\npopulations with population estimates for smoking prevalence, there has\nbeen widespread attention paid to recent mass media reports that\nsmoking may exert a protective effect against COVID‐19 infection.14\nThis led to the World Health Organization releasing a statement on\n11 May urging caution with regards to these claims, and emphasizing the\nlack of evidence confirming a link between smoking or nicotine in the\nprevention or treatment of COVID‐19.15 Consequently, there remains a\ndistinct lack of clarity and high‐quality evidence regarding the relation-\nship between smoking and the severity of COVID‐19. Therefore, to\naddress this important clinical question, this systematic review and meta‐\nanalysis aimed to evaluate the effect of smoking status, including current\nsmoking and a history of smoking, on the clinical severity of COVID‐19.\n2 | METHODS\n2.1 | Search strategy and selection criteria\nThis systematic review and meta‐analysis adhered to PRISMA\nguidelines16 and was AMSTAR 2 compliant (Appendix pp8‐12).13 Two\nauthors independently searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and\nWeb of Science for studies published between 1 December 2019 and\n2 June 2020. The search strategy is provided in the Appendix (p13).\nNo language restrictions were applied. COVID‐19 resource centers\nof The Lancet, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, The New England Journal\nof Medicine, and The BMJ were also hand searched up to 5 July 2020.\nReference lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews\nwere additionally screened for their relevance.\nTo capture all available relevant evidence, randomized, and ob-\nservational studies reporting the smoking status of hospitalized patients\npresenting with different severities of disease and/or at least one clinical\nendpoint of interest were deemed eligible for inclusion. Smoking history\nincluded current and former tobacco smokers or e‐cigarette users.\nDisease severity, including severe or critical cases, was defined a priori\nand based on the COVID‐19 diagnostic criteria issued by the Chinese\nNational Health Commission (Appendix p13).17 Other acceptable cri-\nteria included the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American\nThoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) criteria for severe community‐acquired\npneumonia.18 Clinical endpoints of disease progression, intensive care\nunit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation requirement, and/or mor-\ntality were used as surrogate markers for in‐hospital severity. We ex-\ncluded studies on other coronaviruses or if there was insufficient\ninformation to distinguish disease severity based on smoking status.\nCase series involving less than 20 patients, review articles, editorials,\nconference abstracts, and nonclinical studies were also excluded. Pre-\nprints were not assessed for eligibility due to their preliminary nature.\nTwo authors (WNC, AS) independently screened the titles and\nabstracts of retrieved studies, with full‐texts of all potentially eligible\npapers subsequently assessed for inclusion. Any discrepancy was\nresolved by consensus discussion with the senior author (AK).\n2.2 | Data analysis\nData from studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were extracted\nindependently by three authors (WNC, AS, and RKR). Main data‐\npoints included: study details (author, journal, date, country, study\ndesign, study period, and funding), total numbers of patients, and\ntheir clinical outcomes by smoking status.\nTwo authors (AS and AD) independently assessed the quality of\nincluded studies using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale modified for case\nseries, cohort studies, and cross‐sectional studies.19 Scores were then\nclassified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality stan-\ndards as good, fair, or poor. Any discrepancies in quality assessment\nwere resolved by a third author (WNC).\nAs per our prespecified analysis plan, random‐effects meta‐\nanalyses of pooled raw data were employed using the DerSimonian\nand Laird method for each outcome with sufficient data to account\nfor anticipated differences across countries and study design over\ntime. Current smokers were compared to former and never‐smokers,\nand patients with a smoking history were compared to never‐\nsmokers. Where available, adjusted effect estimates were combined\nand in the absence of adjustment for confounders, raw effect esti-\nmates were combined. The results are presented in forest plots as\nrisk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for\neach outcome. I2 estimates of heterogeneity, representing the\nvariability across studies, are classified as low (<30%), moderate\n(30%‐60%), or high (>60%). Sensitivity analyses included only good‐\nquality studies and, for severity outcomes, studies using the\n1046\n|\nREDDY ET AL.\n 10969071, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26389 by Cochrane Hungary, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025].

Subgroup analyses were\ncompleted by country. Funnel plots were used to check for publication\nbias and tested for asymmetry using Harbord's test,20 with studies with\nno events in either exposed or unexposed arms excluded from this\nanalysis. P values <.05 were considered significant.\nData were analyzed using Stata (version 15). The study protocol was\nprospectively registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42020180920.21\n2.3 | Role of the funding source\nThis study received no funding. All authors had full access to all of the\ndata and took responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n3 | RESULTS\nThe search identified 1038 papers, of which 339 were duplicates. After\nscreening the titles and abstracts of the remaining 699 papers, 350 full‐\ntexts were reviewed. Overall, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria, with a\nfurther 12 identified from the references of included studies or by the\nreviewer team (Figure 1). The 47 included studies4,22‐67 represented a\ntotal of 32 849 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients: 8417 (25.6%) with any\nreported smoking history, comprising 1501 current smokers, 5676 for-\nmer smokers, and 1240 unspecified smokers; 22 420 (68.3%) never‐\nsmokers; and a further 2012 (6.1%) patients who did not currently\nsmoke, though it was unclear whether they were former or never‐\nsmokers (Table 1).\nThere were 25 multicentre studies (three prospective31,49,66\nand 22 retrospective)4,22,25‐27,29,32‐34,38,39,41‐44,47,51,52,54,60,61,63\nand 22 single‐centre studies (two prospective,36,55 two with\nprospective and retrospective components,45,56 and 18 retro-\nspective23,24,28,30,35,37,40,46,48,50,53,57‐59,62,64,65,67). The majority\nof studies investigated a Chinese population (32/47, 68%), with\nthe United States contributing 10 studies. Overall, study quality\nwas good in 22 studies, fair in six and poor in 19 (Appendix p17).\nOf 38 studies disclosing funding status, 28 received funding.\nThree studies32,56,64 reported smoking index or pack‐years by\noutcome of interest. Six studies23,25,39,49,54,61 reported outcomes for\ntobacco smokers, including one25 that had pooled outcomes with those\nof e‐cigarette users. The remaining studies did not specify the substance\nof smoking.\nDisease severity was graded according to the Chinese COVID‐19‐\nspecific criteria in 14 studies,24,28,32,35,38,46,48,53,55,57,63‐66 the IDSA/ATS\ncriteria in three studies34,45,59 and a locally devised criteria in one study\n(Appendix p13).54 Two studies52,62 did not specify the criteria utilized.\nCurrent smokers, whose outcomes were evaluated in 27 studies, had\nan overall prevalence of 6.2% (specifically, China: 8.7%, United States:\n4.6%). They had a significantly increased risk of presenting with severe\ndisease (RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.14‐2.85; P = .012; I2 = 76%; Figure 2A), as\nwell as severe or critical disease (RR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.16‐3.38; P = .012;\nI2 = 87%; Figure 2B), compared to former or never‐smokers.

On sensitivity analysis, including only good‐\nquality studies resulted in these effects becoming nonsignificant. There\nwere no significant effects on in‐hospital outcomes, including disease\nprogression (RR: 1.54; 95% CI: 0.52‐4.58; P = .439; I2 = 81%; Appendix\np19), ICU admission (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.42‐1.24; P = .237; I2 = 40%;\nAppendix p20), mechanical ventilation requirement (RR: 1.13; 95% CI:\n0.75‐1.72; P = .561; I2 = 32%; Appendix p21) or mortality (RR: 1.46; 95%\nCI: 0.83‐2.60; P = .192; I2 = 81%; Figure 2C). There were no differences in\noutcomes by country of origin (Appendix p23). A meta‐analysis was not\nperformed for critical disease alone as only one study reported this\noutcome.\nThe overall prevalence of a smoking history, including current,\nformer, and/or unspecified smokers, was 26.9% (specifically, China:\n10.3%, United States: 23.6%). Their outcomes were investigated in\n35 studies. Compared to never‐smokers, a history of smoking sig-\nnificantly increased the risk of presenting with severe disease (RR:\n1.31; 95% CI: 1.12‐1.54; P = .001; I2 = 12%; Figure 3A), as well as\nsevere or critical disease (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.19‐1.53; P < .0001;\nI2 = 19%; Figure 3B). However, only the effect on severe or critical\ndisease remained significant when limiting the analysis to only stu-\ndies using the COVID‐19‐specific criteria for grading severity\n(Appendix p29). The effect on critical disease alone was not statistically\nsignificant (RR: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.95‐2.17; P = .085; I2 = 0%; Appendix\np25). However, a smoking history significantly increased mortality risk\n(RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.20‐1.32; P < .0001; I2 = 0%; Figure 3C) in addition\nto other in‐hospital outcomes, such as disease progression (RR: 2.18;\n95% CI: 1.06‐4.49; P = .035; I2 = 69%; Appendix p26) and mechanical\nventilation requirement (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01‐1.42; P = .043; I2 = 0%;\nAppendix p28). There was no statistically significant difference in ICU\nadmission (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.96‐1.31; P = .157; I2 = 0%; Appendix\np27). Sensitivity analyses excluding lower‐quality studies supported the\nprimary analyses for all outcomes of interest (Appendix p29). Only the\nmortality analysis facilitated comparison by country, in which sig-\nnificant detrimental effects were observed in publications from China,\nUnited States, and the UK, but not Italy, which contributed one study\nonly for this outcome (Appendix p29).\nOverall, there was a moderate‐to‐high degree of heterogeneity\nbetween studies evaluating the effects of current smoking and a low\ndegree of heterogeneity between studies investigating a history of\nsmoking. The potential for publication bias was only detected in the\ncomparison of disease progression in patients with a smoking history\n(Appendix p26), though heterogeneity was high for this outcome.\n4 | DISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest meta‐analysis amongst peer‐\nreviewed literature assessing the effect of smoking tobacco on the se-\nverity of COVID‐19. Principally, the present analysis found that current\nsmokers have an increased risk of presenting to hospital with severe\nCOVID‐19 and are approximately twice as likely to experience severe\nor critical COVID‐19 as former or never‐smokers. While this risk be-\ncame nonsignificant following sensitivity analysis of good‐quality studies\nonly, there were only two studies for each outcome and none graded\ndisease severity by COVID‐19‐specific criteria, thus precluding mean-\ningful interpretation. Overall, there was a high degree of heterogeneity\namongst studies evaluating current smoking, even when analyzing good‐\nquality studies only. For patients with a smoking history, there is an\nincreased risk of presentation to hospital with severe, as well as severe\nor critical, COVID‐19 and subsequent increased risk of in‐hospital\nmortality. Additionally, these patients were more likely to experience\ndisease progression and require mechanical ventilation. That all out-\ncomes remained significant on inclusion of only good‐quality studies\nsuggests these analyses represent true effects. A high level of hetero-\ngeneity was only observed in assessing the effect of smoking history on\ndisease progression, which is likely secondary to substantial inter‐study\nvariation in defining progression. This outcome also displayed potential\nfor publication bias, however, none was found in other analyses,\nindicating the low impact of publication bias on our results.\nTABLE 1\n(Continued)\nSetting\nStudy design\nNumber of\ncenters\nStudy\nperiod\nNumber of patients,\ncurrent smokers vs\nformer/never‐smokers\nNumber of patients,\nany smoking history vs\nnever‐smokers\nStudy\nquality\nYu et al60\nChina\nCohort\n24\nJan‐Mar\n13 vs 408\n⋯\nGood\nYu et al61\nChina\nCross‐sectional\n2\nJan‐Feb\n⋯\n5 vs 65\nGood\nYu et al62\nChina\nCohort\n1\nJan‐Mar\n⋯\n16 vs 76\nPoor\nYu et al63\nChina\nCohort\n1+\nDec‐Feb\n⋯\n26 vs 265\nFair\nZhang et al64\nChina\nCase series\n1\nJan‐Feb\n2 vs 138\n9 vs 131\nPoor\nZhang et al65\nChina\nCohort\n1\nJan‐Feb\n6 vs 114\n⋯\nFair\nZheng et al66\nChina\nCohort‡\n3\nJan‐Feb\n8 vs 58\n⋯\nFair\nZheng et al67\nChina\nCase series\n1\nJan‐Feb\n8 vs 65\n8 vs 65\nPoor\nZhou et al4\nChina\nCohort\n2\nDec‐Jan\n11 vs 180\n⋯\nGood\nNote: All studies are retrospective except: †ambispective (includes prospective and retrospective components) and ‡prospective.\naContains data from the United States, Canada, and Spain.\nREDDY ET AL.\n|\n1049\n 10969071, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26389 by Cochrane Hungary, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025].

Smoking to-\nbacco is the primary cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in\nthe United States, and is responsible for over 8 million deaths worldwide\nper year.68 Smoking is a major risk factor for adverse respiratory and\ncardiovascular outcomes, in addition to a wide range of malignant\nand nonmalignant disease.68 In addition, smoking increases severity and\nmortality of both bacterial and viral infections through the induction of\nmechanical and structural changes in the respiratory tract and alteration\nof cell‐ and humoral‐mediated immune responses.69,70 In the context of\nrespiratory viruses, smoking has been reported to cause increased hos-\npital and ICU admissions with influenza infection, greater severity with\nrespiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and increased mortality with viral\npneumonia.71‐73\nWith regard to coronaviruses, in particular, smoking is associated\nwith increased susceptibility and mortality in MERS‐CoV infection, po-\ntentially due to upregulation of dipeptidyl peptidase‐IV, the host receptor\nfor MERS‐CoV, in smokers.74,75 The angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2\n(ACE‐2), previously shown to be the host receptor for SARS‐CoV, has\nalso been proven to be the host receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, facilitating\ninitial intracellular entry via interactions with viral spike glycoproteins.76\nSubsequent studies have confirmed that ACE‐2 expression is upregu-\nlated in human lung tissue samples taken from both current and past\nsmokers, likely mediated by the α‐7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptor.77‐81 In a series of elegant in vitro experiments, Smith et al80\nreport a consistent correlation between smoking history and increased\nACE‐2 expression that was dose‐dependent, detectable in both bulk and\nsingle‐cell analyses, and remained significant after multivariate linear\nregression controlling for age, sex, race, and body mass index. It is,\ntherefore, plausible that smokers are exposed to higher SARS‐CoV‐2\nloads as a result of increased expression of ACE‐2, which may provide a\nmechanistic explanation for the increased risk of severe disease and\nmortality associated with smoking in COVID‐19 patients that we report.\nMoreover, the inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 progression in vitro by human\nrecombinant soluble ACE‐2, a neutralizing agent, holds therapeutic po-\ntential and is currently in phase II clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Iden-\ntifier: NCT04335136).82 However, to complicate matters, previous\nstudies also report that postentry viral‐mediated downregulation of\nACE‐2 played a major role in the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐associated\nacute lung injury.83,84 Smoking itself has been postulated as having\nvarying, organ‐specific effects on ACE‐2 levels, with specific cigarette\ncomponents, such as nicotine, potentially exerting a different effect to\nwhole smoke.80 Therefore, further studies characterizing the complex\nrelationship of smoking and ACE‐2 in COVID‐19 are warranted.\nThat smoking history is associated with a significantly increased risk\nof in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients, whilst current smoking is\nnot, is a surprising finding. Reductions in morbidity and all‐cause mor-\ntality following smoking cessation are well characterized and thus for-\nmer smokers would be expected to have better baseline health status\nand improved outcomes.68 A systematic review assessing prevalence of\ncurrent smokers who were hospitalized for COVID‐19 reported a\npooled prevalence of 6.5% and propose that in view of the lower than\nexpected prevalence of current smokers compared to population esti-\nmates, current smoking is not a predisposing factor for hospitalization\nand smoking and/or nicotine may exert a protective effect against se-\nvere COVID‐19.85 The idea that smoking and/or nicotine may be pro-\ntective against COVID‐19 is echoed by several preprint studies that\ngained widespread media attention.14 Although these hypotheses may\nexplain the nonsignificant association of current smoking and increased\nmortality that we report, since the majority of included studies did not\nstatistically adjust the effect of smoking for baseline covariates, it is not\nappropriate to compare the prevalence of smoking in hospitalized\nCOVID‐19 patients with overall population estimates, as the two po-\npulations are inherently different with regards to demographic factors.\nWe believe there are far more credible reasons for the nonsignificant\nassociation between current smoking and mortality that we report and\nthe low prevalence of smoking among patients with COVID‐19 in\npublished studies.\nPredominantly, in the context of a global pandemic, accurately re-\ncording smoking history is likely to be of low priority for frontline\nclinicians whose principal focus is stabilizing severely and critically ill\npatients. Therefore, patients may have been too acutely unwell to an-\nswer questions or clinicians may not enquired directly about smoking\nstatus, leading to misclassification of smokers as nonsmokers. Similarly,\ncollateral history collected from family members or referring clinicians is\nlikely to be less accurate than ascertainment of patient‐reported\nsmoking status. Additionally, in an example of reverse causality, hospi-\ntalized patients are more likely to have quit smoking on admission,\nresulting in additional potential misclassification of current smokers as\nformer or nonsmokers. Given the well‐known scarcity of ICU resources\nsuch as ventilators, it is also possible that social desirability bias may\nhave contributed to patients not reporting current smoking for fear of\nbeing denied access to such interventions, further exacerbating mis-\nclassification bias.14,86 Finally, given the association of smoking with\nlower socioeconomic status,87 it is possible that current smokers are\nexhibiting worse health‐seeking behaviors and either self‐treating or\ndeteriorating in the community. Thus, they would not be accounted for\nin the reported studies which assessed hospitalized patients, leading to\nsurvivorship bias and lower event rates for in‐hospital mortality. Due to\nthese factors, the summary estimate for in‐hospital mortality we report\nhas likely been biased towards a null result for current smokers. Simi-\nlarly, the twofold increase in risk of severe or critical disease for current\nsmokers is likely an underestimate of the effect size.\nWith no targeted therapies against COVID‐19 currently available,\nas a scientific community, we must focus on prevention, particularly\nfor those at risk of severe or critical disease. Frontline clinicians must\nconscientiously record accurate smoking histories in all confirmed\nCOVID‐19 patients, both for triage of vulnerable patients and to\nsupport future research efforts. During the current pandemic,\n1052\n|\nREDDY ET AL.\n 10969071, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26389 by Cochrane Hungary, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nindependent surveys have reported increased smoking frequency in\ncurrent smokers and high rates of relapse in former smokers,88‐90\nwhich is unsurprising given the stress, isolation, and other adverse\npsychosocial repercussions of life during a global pandemic.91,92 Con-\nsidering our finding that current smoking and smoking history are\nassociated with increased COVID‐19 severity, urgent public health\nmeasures emphasizing smoking cessation advice, support and phar-\nmacotherapy must be provided to reduce overall disease burden, de-\nspite a currently altered social landscape. Good‐quality studies have\nproven the benefits of mobile phone‐based interventions,93 high-\nlighting that even during periods of social distancing and self‐isolation,\nremote methods of smoking cessation may be feasible and efficacious.\nFurthermore, as countries begin easing lockdown restrictions, it is\nimperative that governments and policymakers protect vulnerable\npopulations, such as current and former smokers, through adequate\nshielding measures and appropriate legislation.\nThe present analysis has several limitations, principally the use of\naggregate data for our meta‐analysis, which precludes adjustment for\ncertain covariates reported to be predictive of disease severity, such\nas age, gender, and comorbidities,3‐5 and prevents examination of\nheterogeneity and subgroup analysis at the patient level. The use of\nindividual patient data may have addressed this, however, considering\nthe urgency of our research question and direct applicability to patient\ncare, the considerable time burden associated with conducting an in-\ndividual patient data meta‐analysis was deemed inappropriate. Also,\nwith most studies reporting on Chinese populations, we cannot ex-\nclude the possibility of ethnic differences in smoking and susceptibility\nto severe COVID‐19 caused by smoking, which may have confounded\nour analysis. However, this reflects the current landscape of peer‐\nreviewed literature, which at the present time consists mainly of data\nfrom China. We were also unable to assess the effect of e‐cigarettes\non COVID‐19 as no studies collected separate data on their usage,\nwhich would have been informative considering rises in popularity of\nthese products. Finally, as discussed, the high likelihood of mis-\nclassification bias concerning current smoking status across included\nstudies suggests that our analysis potentially underestimates the im-\npact of current smoking on both disease severity and mortality,\ncreating an even more compelling argument for urgent public health\nmeasures to support smoking cessation during the present time.\nIn conclusion, in the largest meta‐analysis available amongst peer‐\nreviewed literature, we report that both current smoking and a smoking\nhistory significantly increased COVID‐19 severity, whilst smoking history\nalso significantly increased mortality risk. Due to problems with potential\nmisclassification of current smokers among included studies, the analysis\nlikely underestimates the likelihood of severity in this patient population.\nAs the COVID‐19 pandemic continues to burden societies worldwide, our\nanalysis suggests that smoking represents one of the most immediately\nmodifiable risk factors to reduce the substantial morbidity associated\nwith the disease. In light of this finding, governments, policymakers, and\nother key stakeholders must ensure that appropriate measures are taken\nto support and maintain smoking cessation to protect vulnerable popu-\nlations and reduce the strain placed on healthcare systems working at full\ncapacity during this global crisis.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPTS is partly funded by King's Health Partners Institute of Women and\nChildren's Health, Tommy's (Registered charity no. 1060508), and by\nARC South London (NIHR).

This indicates that the pandemic is the best \ntime to reduce its frequency or stop the habit, but misinformation that smoking prevents infection \nhas an effect on smokers’ behavior. Therefore, this study aims to assess the beliefs about the effects \nof smoking on COVID‑19 as well as to determine their relationship with smoking habits among \nuniversity student smokers in Jakarta, Indonesia. Methods: This study was carried out in three \nUniversities in Jakarta with a total of 198 respondents, who were selected conveniently. Furthermore, \nindependent variables were derived from the Health Belief Model theory, while the dependent \nvariables include quit intention and smoking frequency. Chi‑square and ordinal regression analyses \nwere carried out to determine the association between the variables. Results: The belief that smoking \nincreases the severity of COVID‑19 as well as having the determination to stop the habit, had an effect \non the respondents’ quit intention. Moreover, perceived barriers, such as feeling anxious  (adjusted \nodds ratio [AOR]: 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19–0.60) and being exposed to information \nthat the habit prevents COVID‑19 severity (AOR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.01–0.71) were protective factors \nagainst the decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked daily. Conclusion: Improving digital health \nliteracy, campaigns to clarify the risk of cigarettes, and self‑efficacy related to cessation are important \nefforts to prevent smoking behavior during a pandemic.\nKeywords: Health belief model, misinformation, quit intentions, smoking behavior, students\nBeliefs about the Effects of Smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 and \nits Impact on the Intention to Quit and Smoking Frequencies among \nUniversity Students Smokers in Jakarta, Indonesia\nOriginal Article\nMochamad Iqbal \nNurmansyah1,  \nIzza Suraya2, \nRidhwan Fauzi3, \nBadra Al‑Aufa4\n1Department of Public Health, \nFaculty of Health Sciences, \nUniversitas Islam Negeri \nSyarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, \n2Department of Public Health, \nFaculty of Health Sciences, \nUniversitas Muhammadiyah \nProf Dr. Hamka, Jakarta, \n3Department of Health Policy \nand Administration, Faculty \nof Public Health, Universitas \nMuhammadiyah Jakarta, \nTangerang, 4Department \nof Applied Health Science, \nVocational Education Program, \nUniversitas Indonesia, \nDepok, Indonesia\nHow to cite this article: Nurmansyah MI, Suraya I, \nFauzi R, Al-Aufa B.

As of early October 2021, \nmore than 250 million people had been \ninfected, with a total of 5.1 million death \ncases globally.[1] Furthermore, a previous \nstudy reported that smoking increased the \nangiotensin‑converting \nenzyme \n2 \nlung \ngene expression, which is the receptor \nof severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus 2.[2] Other studies showed \nthat smoking history was associated with \nCOVID‑19 \nhospitalization, \nincreased \ndisease progression, severe or critical \ncondition, need for a mechanical ventilator, \nand mortality.[3‑6] A meta‑analysis revealed \nthat it was also related to the increased risk \nof COVID‑19 progression and mortality, \nspecifically among young adults.[4] This \nindicates that the best period to quit or \navoid smoking for nonsmokers was during \nthe COVID‑19 pandemic.\nIndonesia is a smoking‑friendly country, \nwhere one‑third of adults were active \nsmokers in 2018, and they accounted for \n33.8% of the total population.[7] Previous \nreports revealed that the number of young \nsmokers is increasing annually. Furthermore, \nthe prevalence of smoking among children \naged 10–18 increased from 7.2% in \n2013 to 9.1% in 2018, while the average \nage of initiation decreased from 17.2 to \n16.8 years.[7] Young smokers are more at risk \nof experiencing severe levels of addiction \nand noncommunicable diseases.[8] However, \nthe majority of smokers did not stop \nsmoking during the COVID‑19 pandemic. \nThis was indicated by a survey in Indonesia, \nwhere there was an increase in the number \nof cigarettes consumed by 20.1% of them, \nwhile 47.6% still had the same amount they \nhad before the pandemic.[9]\nReceived: 26 September, 2022.\nRevised: 21 November, 2022.\nAccepted: 13 January, 2023.\nPublished: 10 February, 2023\nORCID:\nMochamad Iqbal Nurmansyah: \n0000-0001-5609-6038\nIzza Suraya:  \n0000-0001-9035-0407\nRidhwan Fauzi:  \n0000-0002-2475-9631\nBadra Al-Aufa:  \n0000-0001-7449-6799\nNurmansyah, et al.: Belief about the effects of smoking on smoking behavior during the COVID‑19 pandemic\n8\b\nAsian Journal of Social Health and Behavior | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | January-March 2023\nMisinformation that smoking has a protective effect against \nCOVID‑19 is a major factor preventing decrease in the \nprevalence of the habit. A  previous study in Hongkong \nshowed that exposure to this misinformation was associated \nwith a significant increase in tobacco users.[10] However, the \nbelief that smoking can increase the severity of COVID‑19 \ninfection was associated with increased quit intentions.[11] \nIndonesia was ranked among the top three countries with \nthe highest number of smokers,[12] and similar false \ninformation was also spread in the country.[13]\nBased on previous reports, there are no studies on the \nassociation of misinformation and smoking beliefs with \nquit intention and frequencies in Indonesia. Therefore, this \nstudy aims to determine beliefs about the effects of smoking \non COVID‑19 as well as its relationship with the intention \nto quit and smoking behavior among university student \nsmokers in Jakarta, Indonesia. The results are expected to \nbe useful for guiding the designation of health promotion \nand education programs, particularly in addressing the \nissue of how smokers’ beliefs about the effects of smoking \non COVID‑19 failed to decrease the number of daily \ncigarettes smoked during the pandemic.\nMethods\nThis study used a cross‑sectional design method, and the \nsample population consists of registered students from three \ndifferent Universities in Jakarta, Indonesia. Furthermore, \nJakarta was selected as the study location because it \nwas considered the epicenter of the virus in the country. \nPrevious reports showed that it had the highest number of \ncases among other provinces, namely 800 thousand, as of \nJanuary 1, 2022.[14] Universities were selected because the \nmajority of smokers were within the age range of 15–19 \nand 20–24 years, thereby accounting for 48.2% and 26.5% \nof the total population, respectively.[7] At this age, they have \nnot become lifetime smokers, which indicates that there \nis still a high possibility for them to have quit intentions. \nThis is consistent with the Global Adult Tobacco Survey \ncarried out in Indonesia, where the 15–24 years age group \nhad higher intentions to quit smoking than others, and they \naccounted for 36.5% of the total population.[15]\nA total of 198 students were selected using a nonprobability \nmethod with a convenience sampling technique. The \ninclusion criteria were:  (1) Active university students,  (2) \nactive cigarette smokers who had started smoking before \nthe pandemic or ex‑smokers who resumed smoking before \nthe pandemic and stopped during the outbreak. The smokers \nused in this study were people who smoked hand‑rolled and \nclove (kretek) cigarettes within the past 30 days.[15,16] A total \nof 406 students previously participated in this study, but this \nwas reduced to 198 after 208 respondents  (2 respondents \nwere not willing to participate, 37 were not active \nstudents, 131 never smoked, and 38 quit smoking before \nthe pandemic started) were excluded. Data collection was \ncarried out from August to September 2021 by filling out \nonline questionnaires, which were distributed by four trained \nstudy assistants. The data were collected through an online \nmethod due to the mobility restriction policy, which was \nimplemented in several regions of Indonesia. The assistants \nexplained the information about the study procedure to the \nrespondents before data collection and those who agreed \nto participate approved a consent form. There was neither \nforced consent nor sanctions against those who declined \nto participate during the data collection. Phone credit or \nelectronic money in the amount of IDR 15,000/USD 1.05 \nwas given to the respondents as an appreciation for their \nparticipation in this study. Anonymity and confidentiality \nwere ensured during the study process. Ethical clearance \nwas obtained before data collection from the Ethics \nCommittee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Universitas \nIslam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta, Indonesia, with \nthe number Un. 01/F.10/KP. 01.1/KE.SP/08.08.087/2021.\nThis study was designed with the health belief model (HBM) \ntheory, which is one of the most common frameworks used to \nassess prevention behaviors.[17] The HBM theory shows that \nhealth‑related behavior is influenced by people’s perception \nof the threat of health problems (susceptibility and severity), \nthe benefits of preventing the threat, and factors determining \nthe choice to act (barriers, cues to action, and self‑efficacy).[18] \nThe respondents were asked to fill in a self‑administered \nquestionnaire containing 26 questions, which was developed \nfrom a rigorous literature review. Furthermore, the items in the \nHBM models were measured on a 1–6 scales  (1  –  strongly \nagree, 6 – strongly disagree), while the negative items were \nscored in reverse. The respondents were asked about the \naverage number of cigarettes smoked daily, and this was \ncompared to the number before the pandemic to determine \nthe smoking frequency. The quit intention was measured by \nasking whether they have an intention to stop smoking during \nthe pandemic or not.\nStatistical analysis\nThe SPSS 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA)  software \nwas used for data analysis, while the reliability of \nHBM items was measured using Cronbach’s alpha test. \nDescriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages, \nwere used for describing the variables in this study. The \ndependent variables include having an intention to quit \nsmoking and not having an intention, as well as smoking \nfrequency, which was categorized as decreased, increased, \nand not changed. The association between the independent \nand dependent variables was determined using Chi‑square \nand ordinal regression tests. A  bivariate test was also \ncarried out to determine the inclusion of both of them in \nthe multivariate analysis, where independent variables with \na P  <  0.25 were included.[19] In the multivariate analysis, \nlogistic and ordinal binary regressions were used for \nthe quit intention and smoking frequency, respectively. \nFurthermore, this analysis was carried out to determine \nthe potential factors associated with the two variables. \nBackward elimination in the multivariable binary logistic \nNurmansyah, et al.: Belief about the effects of smoking on smoking behavior during the COVID‑19 pandemic\nAsian Journal of Social Health and Behavior | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | January-March 2023\b\n9\nregression was performed to reveal the best predictors of \nquitting smoking intention. Adjusted odds ratios  (AORs) \nand 95% Confidence interval  (CI) were calculated to \nmeasure the strength of the statistical association. In binary \nlogistic regression analysis, the odds ratio  (OR) was set \nfrom the exponential value of beta. In the ordinal logistic \nregression analysis, the AOR was obtained by calculating \nthe exponential value of the estimate. P  < 0.05 were \nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nTable 1 shows that 95.5% of respondents in this study were \nmale, while 80.3% were above 20 years. Furthermore, 42.9% \nstated that the number of cigarettes they smoked before and \nduring the pandemic has not changed, while 30.3% observed \nan increase. Respondents who did not live with their families \nexperienced an increase in smoking during the pandemic \ncompared to those who lived with their families, namely \n35.3% and 29.4%, respectively. A total of 42.0% who were \ninfected with COVID‑19 decreased the daily number of \ncigarettes they smoked during the pandemic.\nTable  2 shows that for those who believing that smoking \nincreased COVID‑19 infection, severity, detriments to \nhealth, and dangerous during the pandemic, did not \nget information that smoking can prevent COVID‑19, \nconfident to terminate cigarette smoking had significantly \nhigher ORs for having the intention to quit smoking during \nthe pandemic.   The results of the multivariate logistic \nregression analysis are presented in Table 3. The Hosmer–\nLemeshow test was higher than the significance value of \n0.05  (0.71), and this indicates that the model established \nis fit. The Nagelkerke R2 obtained in this study was 0.207, \nwhich was considerably low. This was due to various \nfactors that affect the intention to quit smoking, such as \nexternal factors were not examined. Believing that smoking \ndetriments health were 4.0  times to have an intention \nto quit smoking, while those who were confident to quit \nduring the pandemic had 4.9 times more prone to have an \nintention to quit.\nSmokers who believed that smoking during the pandemic \ncan increase the severity of COVID‑19 were likely to \nreduce the number of cigarettes consumed.

Several perceived \nbarriers, such as feeling anxious, difficulty to concentrate, \nfeeling uncomfortable when not smoking, and receiving \ninformation that smoking can prevent COVID‑19, were \nprotective factors against the decrease in the number of \ndaily smoked cigarettes. Moreover, having self‑confidence \nin quitting the habit during the pandemic had significantly \nhigher ORs, as shown in Table  4. Table  5 shows the \nmultivariate ordinal regression analysis results, where the \nwidely spread of COVID‑19 in the living area and being \nreminded by lecturers not to smoke decreased the daily \nnumber of cigarettes smoked during the pandemic with AOR \nof 1.92 and 2.36, respectively. The results also showed that \nfeeling anxious when not smoking and obtaining information \nthat it prevents COVID‑19 severity were protective factors \nagainst the decrease in the daily number of cigarettes.\nDiscussion\nThis study revealed that approximately 68% of respondents \nhad the intention to quit smoking, but this number is higher \nthan studies in the USA,[11] Jordan,[20] and India,[21] namely \n41%, 44%, and 64.6%, respectively. However, it was lower \ncompared to a study in the US during the early stages of \nCOVID‑19.[22] The number of smokers who had intention \nto quit smoking was higher than the number before the \npandemic. Data from the Indonesian Global Adult Tobacco \nSurvey and study at KSA University students revealed that \nonly approximately 38% and 65% of smokers have the \nintention to stop the habit, respectively.[15,23]\nA previous study revealed that the most proximate predictor \nof behavior is the intention or perceived likelihood to \nchange an attitude.[24] Furthermore, another study reported \nthat the goal of abstinence from tobacco is to develop \na mindset to stop its usage.[25] The result showed that \nTable 2: Bivariate analysis of determinants of intention to quit smoking among respondents\nVariables\nFrequency\nIntention to quit\nOR\nP\nIntent to quit\nNot intent to quit\nPerceived susceptibility (I believe that…)\nSmoking increased the chances to get COVID‑19\n83 (41.9)\n66 (79.5)\n17 (20.5)\n2.50 (1.30‑4.89)\n0.008\nCOVID‑19 spreads widely in my living area\n151 (76.3)\n108 (71.5)\n43 (28.5)\n1.70 (0.86‑3.37)\n0.173\nPerceived severity (I believe that …)\nSmoking detriments health\n161 (81.3)\n120 (74.5)\n41 (25.5)\n3.84 (1.83‑8.06)\n<0.001\nSmoking is dangerous during the pandemic\n163 (82.3)\n122 (74.8)\n41 (25.2)\n4.46 (2.08‑9.58)\n<.001\nCigarette smoking increases the severity of \nCOVID‑19 when infected\n138 (69.7)\n103 (74.6)\n35 (25.4)\n2.41 (1.27‑4.55)\n0.010\nPerceived benefits (I believe that…)\nSmoking cigarette could prevent COVID‑19\n154 (77.8)\n108 (70.1)\n46 (29.9)\n0.75 (0.37‑1.67)\n0.526\nSmoking cigarette could prevent severity when \ninfected with COVID‑19\n145 (73.2)\n101 (69.7)\n44 (30.3)\n0.85 (0.43‑1.67)\n0.754\nPerceived barrier (I feel … if do not smoke)\nAnxious\n104 (52.5)\n69 (66.3)\n35 (33.7)\n0.79 (0.43‑1.45)\n0.553\nHard to concentrate\n113 (57.1)\n72 (63.7)\n41 (36.3)\n0.58 (0.31‑1.08)\n0.113\nUncomfortable\n116 (58.6)\n76 (65.5)\n40 (34.5)\n0.79 (0.38‑1.30)\n0.323\nCues to action\nDid not obtain information that smoking can \nprevent COVID‑19\n150 (76.1)\n109 (72.7)\n41 (27.3)\n2.15 (1.09‑4.23)\n0.040\nDid not obtain information that smoking prevent \nseverity during COVID‑19 infection\n154 (78.2)\n109 (70.8)\n45 (29.2)\n1.58 (0.78‑3.2)\n0.270\nMy friend did not promote me to smoke\n158 (79.8)\n110 (69.6)\n48 (30.4)\n1.23 (0.59‑2.57)\n0.710\nMy family did not let me smoke\n120 (60.6)\n86 (71.7)\n34 (28.3)\n1.42 (0.77‑2.61)\n0.335\nMy family sanctioned me when I smoked\n43 (21.7)\n30 (69.8)\n13 (30.2)\n1.07 (0.51‑2.22)\n0.863\nMy lecturer reminded me not to smoke\n86 (43.4)\n64 (74.4)\n22 (25.6)\n1.62 (0.87‑3.00)\n0.171\nSelf‑efficacy\nI am confident to terminate cigarette smoking\n154 (77.8)\n118 (76.6)\n36 (23.4)\n4.74 (2.33‑9.61)\n<0.001\nOR: Odds ratio\nTable 3: Multivariate analysis of determinants of intention to quit smoking among respondents\nVariables\nEstimate\nSE\nWald\nP\nAOR (95% CI)\nI believe that smoking detriments health\n1.40\n0.40\n12.23\n0.000\n4.06 (1.85‑8.90)\nI am confident to terminate cigarette smoking during the pandemic\n2.60\n0.38\n18.06\n0.000\n4.94 (2.37‑10.32)\nOR: Odds ratio, SE: Standard error, AOR: Adjusted OR, CI: Confidence interval\nNurmansyah, et al.: Belief about the effects of smoking on smoking behavior during the COVID‑19 pandemic\nAsian Journal of Social Health and Behavior | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | January-March 2023\b\n11\nsmokers’ quit intention was influenced by the belief that \nsmoking has a harmful effect during the pandemic.\nThis study revealed that feeling confident to stop the habit \nwas significantly associated with quit intentions among the \nrespondents. Previous reports stated that more than 80% of \nsmokers in Indonesia express a desire to stop, but many \nof them do not know how to quit smoking. Global Youth \nTobacco Survey data showed that approximately 23.3% had \nreceived advice or programs to stop the habit.[26] A previous \nstudy also reported that improving self‑regulation strategy \nand emotional intelligence play a pivotal role in increasing \nthe intention and ability to quit smoking.[27]\nThe number of smokers who reduced the intensity during \nthe pandemic was lower than the rates reported in the \ngeneral population of Indonesia, namely 32.3%, yet it \nwas higher than those obtained reported in other different \ncountries, such as Australia, Canada, England, and the \nUnited States with an average of 15.3%.[9,28] This finding \nis consistent with a previous report that COVID‑19 was \nmore severe among smokers, and it was associated with a \nreduction in smoking.[28] The respondents also stated that \nthey experienced a decrease in smoking frequency during \nthe pandemic due to a reduction in their pocket money, \nwhich reduced the number of cigarettes purchased. The \nmajority of them do not have a job; hence, they receive \nmoney from their parents to buy cigarettes. The upkeep \nreceived by the students was also lower because due to \nthe study‑from‑home policies implemented during the \npandemic. A  previous study in Indonesia showed that \nhaving more pocket money increased the likelihood to \nsmoke.[29]\nThe respondents also revealed that there was a decrease in \nthe time spent with their friends due to the lockdown policy, \nTable 5: Multivariate analysis of determinants of smoking behavior among respondents\nVariables\nβ\nAOR 95% CI\nP\nCOVID‑19 spreads widely in my living area\n0.654\n1.92 (1.01‑3.67)\n0.047\nI feel anxious when do not smoke\n1.076\n0.34 (0.19‑0.60)\n0.000\nObtain information that smoking prevents COVID‑19 severity\n0.799\n0.45 (0.01‑0.71)\n0.020\nMy lecturer reminded me not to smoke\n0.858\n2.36 (1.34‑4.15)\n0.003\nOR: Odds ratio, AOR: Adjusted OR, CI: Confidence interval\nTable 4: Bivariate analysis of determinants of smoking behavior among respondents\nVariables\nCigarette smoking number\nOR\nP\nDecrease\nNot changed\nIncrease\nPerceived susceptibility (I believe that…)\nSmoking increased the chances to get COVID‑19\n29 (34.9)\n30 (36.1)\n24 (28.9)\n1.50 (0.89‑2.54)\n0.131\nCOVID‑19 spreads widely in my living area\n48 (31.8)\n58 (38.4)\n45 (29.8)\n1.69 (0.92‑3.12)\n0.092\nPerceived severity (I believe that …)\nSmoking detriments health\n51 (31.7)\n65 (40.4)\n45 (28.0)\n2.45 (1.24‑4.85)\n0.010\nSmoking is dangerous during the pandemic\n51 (31.3)\n66 (40.5)\n46 (28.2)\n2.36 (1.18‑4.74)\n0.015\nCigarette smoking increases the severity of COVID‑19 \nwhen infected\n48 (34.8)\n50 (36.2)\n40 (29.0)\n2.04 (1.15‑3.61)\n0.015\nPerceived benefits (I believe that…)\nSmoking cigarette could prevent COVID‑19\n47 (30.5)\n66 (42.9)\n41 (26.6)\n0.44 (0.23‑0.83)\n0.011\nSmoking cigarette could prevent COVID‑19 severity\n43 (29.7)\n65 (44.8)\n37 (25.5)\n0.48 (0.27‑0.87)\n0.016\nPerceived barrier (I feel … if do not smoke)\nAnxious\n16 (15.4)\n44 (42.3)\n44 (42.3)\n0.28 (0.16‑0.49)\n<0.001\nHard to concentrate\n19 (16.8)\n50 (44.2)\n44 (38.9)\n0.33 (0.19‑0.57)\n<0.001\nUncomfortable\n21 (18.1)\n52 (44.8)\n43 (37.1)\n0.39 (0.23‑0.67)\n<0.001\nCues to action\nObtain information that smoking can prevent COVID‑19\n8 (17.0)\n20 (42.6)\n19 (40.4)\n0.53 (0.28‑0.98)\n0.041\nObtain information that smoking prevent the severity \nduring COVID‑19 infection\n8 (18.6)\n17 (39.5)\n18 (41.9)\n0.53 (0.28‑1.01)\n0.052\nMy friend encourages me to smoke\n11 (27.5)\n12 (30)\n17 (42.5)\n0.55 (0.29‑1.05)\n0.068\nMy family let me smoke\n19 (24.4)\n28 (35.9)\n31 (39.7)\n1.65 (0.97‑2.81)\n0.067\nMy family sanctioned me when I smoked\n17 (39.5)\n15 (34.9)\n11 (25.6)\n1.77 (0.94‑3.32)\n0.078\nMy lecturer reminded me not to smoke\n36 (41.9)\n29 (33.7)\n21 (24.4)\n2.57 (1.50‑4.40)\n0.001\nSelf‑efficacy\nI am confident to terminate cigarette smoking\n51 (33.1)\n58 (37.7)\n45 (29.2)\n2.11 (1.12‑3.98)\n0.021\nOR: Odds ratio\nNurmansyah, et al.: Belief about the effects of smoking on smoking behavior during the COVID‑19 pandemic\n12\b\nAsian Journal of Social Health and Behavior | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | January-March 2023\nwhich led to a decline in smoking frequency. A  previous \nstudy in Indonesia showed that smoking was a tool to making \nfriends.[30] During the pandemic, the Indonesian government \nimplemented various policies to limit communities’ mobility, \nsuch as large‑scale social restrictions  pembatasan sosial \nberskala besar (PSBB) and community restriction activities \npolicy pemberlakuan pembatasan kegiatan masyarakat (PPKM); \nhence, several nonessential activities were restricted.[31]\nThis study also showed that having received information that \nsmoking can prevent COVID‑19 severity was a protective \nfactor for respondents to reduce the frequency during the \npandemic. A  different study in Hong Kong also reported a \nsimilar pattern, where exposure to health misinformation \nwas related to the increase in tobacco use during the \noutbreak.[10] In the pandemic situation, there was several \nfalse and misleading information in the digital and physical \nenvironments.[32] This condition was referred to as infodemic \nby the World Health Organization, and it is characterized by \nan overabundance of information, where some are false. This \nmakes it difficult for people to find trustworthy sources and \nreliable guidance when they need it.[33]\nA systematic review featured tobacco products in the \ntop five categories for health misinformation on social \nmedia.[34] However, misinformation is dangerous during \nthe pandemic, and it is often amplified by social media \nin this technological era.[35] Low literacy level is one \nof the factors driving the massive spread of fake news \nor hoaxes.[36] A previous study showed that a lack of \nknowledge is associated with reduced adoption of \nprotective behaviors, such as nonsmoking behavior.[37] This \nshows that improving health literacy, including digitally, is \nvery important to enable healthy decisions for COVID‑19 \npreventive measures.[38,39]\nLimitations\nDuring the data collection, the Indonesian government \nimplemented a policy called Community Restrictions, \nwhere the mobility of people was very restricted. Hence, \nan online survey was used instead of a face‑to‑face survey. \nConsequently, there was a tendency that only people who \nhad access to the Internet participated.  This study was also \nonly carried out at three universities in South Jakarta, which \nmight not represent all students in Indonesia. This indicates \nthat further studies are needed to determine the effect of \nsmoking on COVID‑19 in a wider youth population.\nConclusion\nThe evidence showed that smokers were still exposed \nto misinformation regarding the effects of smoking on \nCOVID-19. Respondents who believed that smoking \ncigarettes was dangerous during the pandemic and the \ndetermination to terminate the cigarette smoking habit \nsignificantly associated with the intention to quit smoking \nduring the pandemic. While perceived barrier and exposure \nto misinformation about smoking were protective factors \nagainst the decrease of the daily cigarette smoking \nnumbers. Health Literacy, including digital health literacy \nof the students should be improved to increase the ability in \ncountermeasures against misinformation and disinformation \nduring the pandemic. Furthermore, increasing Campaigns \nto clarify the risks of tobacco use during the pandemic, \nand the benefits of reducing or quit smoking during the \npandemic should be intensified. Moreover, helping smokers \nin overcoming barriers to reducing and quitting smoking \nand strengthening self-efficacy could be performed by \nhealth facilities; by optimizing hotlines for smoking \ncessation, performing training and disseminating the \nguidance to quitting the smoking habit.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nThis study was funded by the Research and Development \nCentre of Universitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah \nJakarta.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n1.\t\nWorld \nHealth \nOrganization. \nWHO \nCoronavirus \nDisease \n(COVID-19) Dashboard; 2022.

We performed this study to explore the association between \nsmoking and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients utilizing a quantitative \nmeta-analysis on the basis of adjusted effect estimates.\nAims and Methods:  We conducted a systematic search of the online databases including PubMed, \nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Embase. Only articles reporting adjusted effect estimates on the \nassociation between smoking and the risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients in English were \nincluded.

The au-\nthors concluded that smoking was not significantly associated \nwith increased mortality of COVID-19 on the basis of five studies \nwith 838 cases (odds ratio  =  1.45, 95% confidence interval \n[CI]  =  0.78–2.72). However, the pooled effect in this meta-\nanalysis was synthesized on the basis of unadjusted effect esti-\nmates. It has been reported that several risk factors including \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/23/11/1947/6287961 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1948\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2021, Vol. 23, No. 11\ngender, age, and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, \netc.) have significant influences on clinical progression of COVID-\n19 patients,2–5 suggesting that these risk factors might modulate \nthe association between smoking and the risk of COVID-19 mor-\ntality. Moreover, multiple studies have reported that the effect es-\ntimates on the association of smoking with COVID-19 mortality \nwere markedly reduced in multivariable analyses compared with \nunivariate analyses.6–8 Therefore, this present meta-analysis aimed \nto clarify whether smoking (current/former) increased the risk of \ndeath in patients with confirmed COVID-19 compared with never \nsmoking using a quantitative meta-analysis based on adjusted ef-\nfect estimates.\nMethods\nThis meta-analysis rigorously adhered to Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guide-\nlines (http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/). We \nconducted a systematic search of the online databases including \nPubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase from January 15, \n2020 to April 12, 2021. The search terms and key words we \nused were as follows: “coronavirus disease 2019” or “COVID-\n19” or “SARS-CoV-2” or “2019-nCoV” or “novel coronavirus” \nand “smoking” or “smoker” or “tobacco” or “cigarette” or “clin-\nical characteristics” and “mortality” or “fatality” or “death” or \n“non-survivor” or “deceased.” The detailed search strategies of \nvarious databases are available in Supplementary Table S1. The \neligibility criteria were as follows: (1) articles published in English \nas of April 12, 2021; (2) studies that examined inpatients and \n(or) outpatients diagnosed COVID-19 according to World Health \nOrganization (WHO) criteria; (3) articles reporting adjusted ef-\nfect estimates on the association between smoking and the risk of \nmortality among COVID-19 patients; (4) observational studies, \nretrospective studies, prospective studies, cross-sectional studies, \nand case series. The exclusion criteria were the following: (1) non-\nEnglish-language studies; (2) studies reporting only unadjusted \neffect estimates on the association between smoking and COVID-\n19 mortality; (3) review articles, errata, comments, or repeated \narticles (for studies based on the same data sources, we included \nonly the articles with the most complete data); (4) studies without \nthe adjusted effect sizes for the impact of smoking on COVID-\n19 mortality. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was fitted to assess the risk \nof bias.\nData from the included studies were extracted independ-\nently by two authors (Hongjie Hou and Yang Li). Disagreements \nwere resolved by consensus. The main information included: first \nauthor’s name, country, study design, sample size, adjusted risk \nfactors, smoking status, age, percentage of male, and effect esti-\nmates. The definitions of the extracted variables are reported in \nSupplementary Table S2. Our study defined the exposed group as \nthose with a history of smoking (former or current smokers) and \nthe control group as never smokers. The study outcome was death \n(deceased, died, dead, death, mortality, non-survival, and fatal) \nin patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Stata 11.2 (StataCorp LP, \nCollege Station, TX) was applied to calculate the pooled effect \nand 95% CI on the association between smoking and COVID-19 \nmortality using a random (inverse-variance heterogeneity) model. \nHeterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic. We performed sub-\ngroup analyses based on age, country, study design, and effect es-\ntimate to detect the major sources of heterogeneity for the reason \nthat differences in the age distributions and regional distributions \nof study subjects are often an important source of clinical hetero-\ngeneity. Similarly, methodological heterogeneity is often induced \nby the differences in study designs and effect estimates of the in-\ncluded studies. Sensitivity analysis by omitting studies one by one \nwas conducted to examine the stability of our results using R soft-\nware (version 3.6.3, The R Foundation). We evaluated publication \nbias with Begg’s rank correlation test and Egger’s linear regression \ntest to draw more robust conclusions (we regarded publication \nbias existence if the two tests do not provide a similar result). p ≤ \n.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 25  117 studies were retrieved through initial search. \nAfter removing duplications and screening titles and abstracts, 138 \nrecords remained for full-text evaluation. Sixty-five articles were \nsubsequently excluded due to lack of adjusted effect estimates on \nthe association of smoking with the risk of mortality in COVID-\n19 patients. Finally, 73 studies with 863  313 COVID-19 patients \nwere included in this meta-analysis. The flow diagram of study se-\nlection is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The primary character-\nistics of the included studies are presented in Supplementary Table \nS3. And the results of the risk of bias assessment are displayed in \nSupplementary Table S4.\nOverall, smoking was significantly linked to an increased risk of \nmortality in patients with COVID-19 (pooled relative risk = 1.19, \n95% CI = 1.12–1.27, random-effects model) (Figure 1). When we \nrestricted analysis in studies presenting data on former smoking ex-\nplicitly, there was a significant association between former smoking \nand the increased risk for mortality (18 studies, pooled relative \nrisk  =  1.15, 95% CI  =  1.05–1.26) (Supplementary Figure S2A), \nwhereas in studies reporting current smokers explicitly, there was \nno significant association between current smoking and the risk for \nmortality (17 studies, pooled relative risk = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.90–\n1.26) (Supplementary Figure S2B). This significant association \nwas also observed in subgroup analyses based on age (23 studies, \npooled relative risk = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05–1.35 for ≤60 years old \nand 42 studies, pooled relative risk = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.17–1.48 for \n>60 years old) (Supplementary Figure S3) and effect estimates (27 \nstudies, pooled hazard ratio = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.17–1.42; 44 studies, \npooled odds ratio =1.16, 95% CI  =  1.05–1.29) (Supplementary \nFigure S4). Subgroup analysis by study design revealed that there \nwas a significant association between smoking and the increased \nrisk for mortality of COVID-19 patients among retrospective study \n(49 studies, pooled relative risk  =  1.30, 95% CI  =  1.18–1.43), \nbut not among prospective study (22 studies, pooled relative \nrisk = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.93–1.25) (Supplementary Figure S5). As \nwe implemented subgroup analysis by countries, the association \nwas still significant in the subgroups of China (6 studies, pooled \nrelative risk = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.44–2.19), Spain (4 studies, pooled \nrelative risk = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.01–2.21), and United States (30 \nstudies, pooled relative risk = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05–1.34), while \nno significant association was found in the subgroups of Italy (6 \nstudies, pooled relative risk = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.94–2.35), England \n(7 studies, pooled relative risk = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.96–1.29), and \nMexico (6 studies, pooled relative risk  =  0.96, 95% CI  =  0.93–\n0.99) (Supplementary Figure S6). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated \nthat our results were robust and reliable (Supplementary Figure \nS7). Publication bias existed in Begg’s test (p = .025, Supplementary \nFigure S8A) and Egger’s test (p < .001, Supplementary Figure S8B).\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/23/11/1947/6287961 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1949\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2021, Vol. 23, No. 11\nDiscussion\nThere have been four meta-analyses investigating the association be-\ntween smoking and the mortality of COVID-19 patients.1,9–11 But \nthe findings from all these previous meta-analyses were based on \nunadjusted effect estimates.

Firstly, smoking can cause mucociliary clearing dys-\nfunction and poor pulmonary immunity, leading to more severe \ninfection.12,13 Secondly, smoking can impair redox balance and in-\ncrease the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines, such \nas tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8. And \nthis process might promote cytokine storm marked by overpro-\nduction of similar inflammatory mediators, which is closely linked \nto adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.14,15 Additionally, \nrecent studies have reported that smoking may upregulate the ex-\npression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which serves as a re-\nceptor when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enters \ncells.16–18 Although the relationship between angiotensin-converting \nenzyme 2 expression and disease severity in COVID-19 patients re-\nmains unclear, it can be assumed that the upregulated expression of \nangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 might play a role in poor prog-\nnoses of smokers through vascular dysfunction or proinflammatory \nresponse.\nIn further subgroup analysis by smoking status, the significant \nassociation was observed in former smoking, but not in current \nsmoking. The inconsistent results between former smoking and cur-\nrent smoking might be partly explained by longer exposure times \nand higher prevalence of smoking-related conditions such as cardio-\nvascular and respiratory illness in former smokers. Our finding that \ncurrent smoking was not significantly associated with the increased \nmortality of COVID-19 patients agreed with previous finding by \nReddy et  al.10 This insignificant association might be due to the \ninaccurate records of smoking status during the global pandemic, \nwhich resulted in the misclassification of smokers as nonsmokers \nand biased the pooled effect of current smoking toward a null re-\nsult. Furthermore, self-isolation and lockdown restrictions during \nthe pandemic, combined with increased unemployment and exces-\nsive fear caused by the pandemic, might increase relapse of former \nsmokers and initiation of smoking in nonsmokers, which could po-\ntentially dilute the smokers with healthy individuals with less cumu-\nlative exposure to tobacco. These speculations need to be validated \nby the further prospective studies which report the duration of ex-\nposure precisely.\nIn our study, subgroup analysis by effect estimate indicated that \nthe significant association between smoking and COVID-19 mor-\ntality was found in odds ratio-reported studies and hazard ratio-\nreported studies, but not in risk ratio-reported studies. Our study \nfinally included 73 articles, of which 44 reported odds ratios and \n27 reported hazard ratios. In particular, the only two risk ratio-\nreported articles presented that there was no significant association \nbetween smoking and COVID-19 mortality. Likewise, there were 49 \nretrospective studies, 22 prospective studies, and 2 retrospective–\nprospective studies according to the stratification by study design. \nResults indicated that there was a significant association between \nsmoking and the increased risk for mortality of COVID-19 patients \namong retrospective study, but not among prospective study and \nretrospective–prospective study. Similar pictures emerged in the ana-\nlysis of subgroup based on country. Thus, our results need to be veri-\nfied by further studies based on large sample sizes.\nSeveral limitations should be acknowledged in this current \nmeta-analysis. Firstly, smoking status varied among studies in-\ncluded in our analysis. Some studies reported smoking status as \n“current” or “former” separately, while other studies reported as a \nhistory of smoking generally. And most of studies included in our \nanalysis didn’t present the data on either duration of smoking or \nany special smoking habits such as electronic cigarette, water pipe, \nand passive smoking. Secondly, although we searched as much \nliterature as possible, there was publication bias in this study. \nThirdly, there was obvious heterogeneity assessed through I2. To \ndetect the major source of heterogeneity, we performed subgroup \nanalyses of age, countries, study design, and effect estimates, re-\nspectively. Whereas, no clear heterogeneity source was identified. \nFourthly, although the included studies reported adjusted effect \nestimates, the adjusted confounding factors varied across studies. \nFifthly, the included studies were mainly retrospective, further \nprospective studies with large sample sizes are needed to verify \nthe findings.\nIn conclusion, this present meta-analysis based on adjusted ef-\nfect estimates showed that smoking was independently associated \nwith an increased risk for mortality in COVID-19 patients. These \npreliminary findings might contribute to the risk stratification of \npatients with COVID-19. Policymakers, physicians, and public \nhealth professionals should take effective measures to promote \nsmoking cessation in order to reduce the mortality in patients \nwith COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic should serve as an \nincentive for patients and at-risk populations to quit smoking. \nMore detailed and complete data on smoking status should be \ncollected to more accurately estimate the effect of smoking on \nCOVID-19 mortality. The mechanisms by which smoking in-\ncreases the risk of poor prognoses in COVID-19 patients are not \nfully understood yet, especially regarding angiotensin-converting \nenzyme 2, which warrants further study. Smoking cessation is \none of the most immediately modifiable factors for reducing the \nheavy burden associated with the disease, especially in countries \nwith higher tobacco burdens and higher numbers of vulnerable \npopulations.\nSupplementary Material\nA Contributorship Form detailing each author’s specific involvement with this \ncontent, as well as any supplementary data, are available online at https://\nacademic.oup.com/ntr.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \n(81973105), Key Scientific Research Project of Henan Institution of Higher \nEducation (21A330008), and Joint Construction Project of Henan Medical \nScience and Technology Research Plan (LHGJ20190679).

  "ERJ-01290-2020.pdf": "Current smoking is not associated with\nCOVID-19\nTo the Editor:\nWe have read with interest the paper by LEUNG et al. [1] recently published in the European Respiratory\nJournal, reporting a higher expression of the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) in the\nsmall airway epithelia of smokers and COPD patients with putatively important implications for\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, since ACE-2 has been shown to be the receptor utilised by\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter the host cell [2]. Furthermore, the\nauthors reported that current smokers showed a higher expression of ACE-2 gene expression than\nnon-smokers, concluding that the increased ACE-2 expression in smokers might predispose to increased\nrisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [1].\nTo this regard, all epidemiological data published so far reported that COVID-19 patients show a very low\nprevalence of smokers, with no significant association between current smoking and severe disease in\nCOVID-19 patients [3–6].\nAt the University-Hospital of Padova, located in the Veneto Region, one of the areas in Italy most affected\nby COVID-19, between 15 March and 10 April, 2020, 132 patients were assessed in our clinic for\nSARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia. The analysis of patients’ smoking history showed that no-one was a\ncurrent smoker, with 112 patients (84.8%) who had never smoked and 20 (15.2%) who were former\nsmokers. These data are in agreement with those from China [3–6]. Furthermore, there was no difference\nin the disease severity between patients who never smoked and former smokers. These data are even more\nstriking if we consider that the percentage of current smokers in Italy and in the Veneto Region is 25.7%\nand 22.7%, respectively (www.epicentro.iss.it/passi/dati/fumo).\nThus, the conclusions of LEUNG et al. [1] to consider cigarette smoking as a severe risk factor for\nCOVID-19 pneumonia are in contrast with the strong and consolidated epidemiological data coming from\nChina [3–6] that have been confirmed also in our patients.\nMarco Rossato\n, Lucia Russo, Sara Mazzocut, Angelo Di Vincenzo, Paola Fioretto and Roberto Vettor\nClinica Medica 3, Dept of Medicine – DIMED, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.\nCorrespondence: Marco Rossato, Clinica Medica 3, Dept of Medicine – DIMED, University-Hospital of Padova, Via\nGiustiniani, 2, 35128 Padova, Italy.

Rossato and co-workers, we too have been struck by the relative underrepresentation of current\nsmokers in cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, particularly in light of our recent\nfindings\nthat\nthe\nsevere\nacute\nrespiratory\nsyndrome\ncoronavirus\n2\n(SARS-CoV-2)\nreceptor\nangiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) is upregulated in the airway epithelium of this population [1].\nChina [2], Italy (as reported by M. Rossato and co-workers), and now New York City [3] have all reported\ncurrent smoking rates below those of their respective general populations. The reason for this is a mystery.\nOne possible explanation is misclassification of smoking status owing to under-reporting of smoking in these\ncohorts. Another is that smokers may be taking medications that may offer some protection against\nCOVID-19 (e.g. certain inhalers). It should be noted that severe COVID-19 preferentially targets the older\npopulation (>65 years) with comorbidities, in whom smoking rates are approximately 3–5 fold lower than that\nin the general population. Thus, the background smoking rates in the severe COVID-19 susceptible subgroups\nmay be much lower than the general smoking rates of the population. Notwithstanding these issues, we\nshould be extraordinarily cautious about the messaging surrounding smoking and COVID-19, especially in\nthese fraught times where misinformation is commonly amplified in a vacuum of rigorous evidence [4, 5]. We\nare unaware of any evidence to date that demonstrates that smoking is protective against COVID-19. In fact,\nalthough current smoking has not been found to be a major risk factor for COVID-19, COPD patients appear\nto have worse outcomes upon contracting the virus with an almost threefold odds ratio of dying, needing\nmechanical ventilation, or being admitted to an intensive care unit [6]. As many of our COPD patients in this\npandemic fit an unfavourable demographic profile – elderly, male, and with cardiovascular comorbidities – we\nwould continue to recommend exercising caution in protecting them from COVID-19.\nJanice M.

Design\nCross‐sectional household surveys. Setting and participants\nA\nrepresentative sample of the population in England from April to May 2020. The sample included 3179 adults aged\n≥18 years. Measurements\nParticipants who reported that they deﬁnitely or thought they had coronavirus were\nclassiﬁed as having self‐reported COVID‐19. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning\nhome, before preparing foods, before eating or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to\nCOVID‐19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke\ninside the home. Findings\nOdds of self‐reported COVID‐19 were signiﬁcantly greater among current smokers [20.9%,\nadjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 1.04–1.73] and long‐term (> 1‐year) ex‐smokers\n(16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05–1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1‐year) ex‐smokers had\nnon‐signiﬁcantly greater odds of self‐reported COVID‐19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85–2.53). Bayes factors\nindicated there was sufﬁcient evidence to rule out large differences in self‐reported COVID‐19 by NRT use and medium\ndifferences by e‐cigarette use. With the exception of hand‐washing before face‐touching, engagement in hand‐washing\nbehaviours was high (> 85%), regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of quit attempts in the past 3 months were\nreportedly triggered by COVID‐19, and approximately one in 10 current e‐cigarette users reported attempting to quit\nvaping because of COVID‐19. Conclusions\nIn England, current smokers and long‐term ex‐smokers appear to have\nhigher odds of self‐reported COVID‐19 compared with never smokers in adjusted analyses, but there were no large differ-\nences between people who used nicotine replacement therapy or e‐cigarettes. Engagement in hand‐washing appears to be\nhigh, regardless of nicotine or tobacco use.

Tobacco smoking was considered an a\npriori risk factor for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and poor\nCOVID‐19 disease outcomes: current and former smoking\nis known to increase the risk of respiratory viral and bacte-\nrial infection and adverse disease outcomes compared with\nnever smoking [2,3]. Behavioural factors involved in both\nsmoking and vaping, such as regular hand‐to‐mouth\nmovements, may increase viral infection and transmission\nif performed without accompanying protective behaviours\nsuch as hand‐washing [4]. However, early descriptive epi-\ndemiology from the ongoing pandemic produced surprising\nresults. Limited, mixed‐quality evidence suggests lower\nthan expected smoking rates among those testing positive\nfor SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and those hospitalized with\nCOVID‐19 [5,6]. This has led to the hypothesis that nico-\ntine may protect against a hyperinﬂammatory response\nto SARS‐CoV‐2 infection [7,8], thus preventing adverse\n© 2020 The Authors.

Our aim is to use a large,\nrepresentative population survey with reliable assessment\nof smoking status to estimate rates of self‐reported\nSARS‐CoV‐2 infection in relation to smoking status.\nThe early literature has focused on smoking and\nCOVID‐19 disease. However, comparisons of rates of\nCOVID‐19\nbetween\nsmokers,\nex‐smokers\nand\nnon‐smokers are a poor test of the nicotine hypothesis.\nOther components in tobacco smoke could lead to greater\nsymptom severity, which could obscure the hypothesized\nprotective\neffect\nof\nnicotine.\nElectronic\ncigarettes\n(e‐cigarettes) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)\nhave lower toxicity than cigarettes [9,10]. Therefore, an\nassessment of the use of these products provides a better\ntest of a potential protective effect of nicotine. Despite this,\nfew studies so far in the pandemic have measured the use of\ne‐cigarettes or NRT [11]. In addition, most studies have not\nbeen able to rely upon representative sampling, and have\nfailed to distinguish between current smokers, recent\nex‐smokers, long‐term ex‐smokers and never smokers [5].\nOur secondary aim is therefore to estimate rates of\nCOVID‐19 by use of alternative nicotine products in a\nrepresentative population survey.\nHand‐washing is an important behaviour in reducing\nthe transmission of infectious diseases throughout the pop-\nulation, especially for those that are primarily spread\nthrough respiratory droplets [12]. Because of the repeated\nhand‐to‐mouth\nmovements\ninvolved\nin\nsmoking\nand vaping, current smokers and e‐cigarette users may\nbe less likely to wash their hands regularly before touching\ntheir face. Additionally, personality factors, such as lower\nrisk aversion [13], could lead to reduced hand‐washing\namong tobacco and nicotine users. These behavioural\nfactors could explain differences in rates of COVID‐19 by\nsmoking status, e‐cigarette use or NRT use. Therefore,\nin\nthis\nstudy\nwe\nmeasured\nassociations\nbetween\nself‐reported engagement in hand‐washing behaviours\nand use of these products.\nIn the absence of clear evidence as to whether smoking\nis a risk factor for COVID‐19 or hospitalization, public\nhealth messaging has focused upon general beneﬁts of\nquitting tobacco smoking [14,15]. Some organizations,\nsuch as the American Lung Association [16], have also\nurged people to stop using e‐cigarettes (‘vaping’), claiming\nthat doing so may reduce their risk of developing severe\nCOVID‐19 symptoms—despite little evidence to support\nthis. The COVID‐19 pandemic\nmay therefore\nhave\nprompted smokers and e‐cigarette users to attempt to stop\nin greater numbers.\nSocial distancing measures, introduced in England in\nMarch 2020, limited people to leave their home only for\nfood, health care, exercise and essential work [17]. These\nmeasures may have increased the amount people smoke\ninside their home, which would be especially damaging be-\ncause school closures meant that children were house-\nbound and at risk of exposure to second‐hand smoke.\nThe COVID‐19 pandemic has exacerbated heath in-\nequalities in England, with the highest mortality rates\nfound among people working in manual, routine and ser-\nvice occupations [18] and in black and ethnic minority\ngroups [19]. In addition, those living in deprived areas\nare the most likely to be diagnosed with COVID‐19 and\nhave worse outcomes when hospitalized [20]. Because\nsmoking and vaping prevalence is highest among people\nfrom disadvantaged groups [21], the impact these behav-\niours have on COVID‐19 may be more pronounced in these\ngroups. In this study, we will use a representative\npopulation sample of adults in England to estimate:\n1 associations\nbetween\nself‐reported\nCOVID‐19\nand\nsmoking status, e‐cigarette use and NRT use;\n2 associations between handwashing and smoking status,\ne‐cigarette use and NRT use;\n3 the proportion of smokers and e‐cigarette users who\nhave attempted to quit product use because they are\nmotivated by the pandemic;\n4 the proportion of smokers, with or without children in\ntheir household, who are smoking more, less, or the\nsame amount inside their home; and\n5 whether the above associations vary by socio‐economic\nstatus (SES).\nMETHODS\nDesign\nThis study is part of the ongoing Smoking Toolkit Study\n(STS), a monthly cross‐sectional survey in England. It pro-\nvides detailed information on smoking, vaping and NRT\nuse. It recruits approximately 1700 participants per month\nusing a combination of random location and quota sam-\npling [22]. Interviews are performed with one household\nmember until quotas based on factors inﬂuencing the prob-\nability of being at home (e.g. gender, age, working status)\nare fulﬁlled. Comparisons with sales data and other na-\ntional surveys show that the STS recruits a representative\nsample of the population in England with regard to key de-\nmographic variables, smoking prevalence and cigarette\nconsumption [22,23]. Data are usually collected through\nface‐to‐face computer‐assisted interviews. However, social\ndistancing restrictions under the COVID‐19 pandemic\nmean that data from April and May 2020 were collected\nvia telephone, but relied upon the same combination of\nrandom location and quota sampling and weighting\nCOVID‐19, smoking, vaping and quitting\n1187\n© 2020 The Authors.

Those who\nreported having stopped smoking within the last year were\nconsidered recent ex‐smokers. Those who reported having\nstopped smoking more than a year ago were considered\nlong‐term ex‐smokers. All others were considered never\nsmokers. Never smokers were used as the reference\ncategory when calculating odds ratios (ORs). The term\n‘past‐year smoker’ was be used to refer to the group of both\ncurrent and recent ex‐smokers.\nE‐cigarette and NRT use\nParticipants were asked which products they are currently\nusing to cut down the amount they smoke, in situations\nwhen they are not allowed to smoke, to help them stop\nsmoking, or for anyother reason at all. Those who reported\ncurrently using e‐cigarettes were considered current\ne‐cigarette users and those who reported currently using\nNRT (e.g. gum, patches, lozenges) were considered current\nNRT users.\nSelf‐reported COVID‐19\nParticipants were told that the symptoms of coronavirus\nare high temperature/fever or a new, continuous cough.\nThey were then asked which of the following statements\nbest applies to them: (1) ‘I deﬁnitely have coronavirus’,\n(2) ‘I think I have coronavirus’, (3) ‘I deﬁnitely had corona-\nvirus’, (4) ‘I think I had coronavirus’, (5) ‘I do not have or\nthink I have had coronavirus’, (6) ‘don’t know’ and (7)\n‘prefer not to say’. Those who responded that they\n‘deﬁnitely’ or ‘think they’ have/had coronavirus (1–4)\nwere labelled as having a self‐reported COVID‐19.\nHand‐washing\nParticipants were asked how frequently, during the last\nweek, they (i) washed their hands when they got home\nafter being out, (ii) washed their hands before they ate,\n(iii) washed their hands before they prepared food and\n(iv) touched their eyes, nose or mouth without washing\ntheir hands ﬁrst. For all questions, participants could\nrespond ‘always’, ‘most of the time’, ‘about half the time’,\n‘less than half the time’, ‘never’ or ‘don’t know’. Responses\nwere grouped into two categories: engaging in the behav-\niour the majority (most/always) of the time, coded 1, and\nall others, coded 0. For question (i), participants could re-\nspond that they have not left the house, and for question\n(ii), that they have not prepared food in the last week. Indi-\nviduals who gave these responses were considered\nprotected against infection, with responses coded as 1. Re-\nsponses from question (iv) were reverse‐coded to reﬂect the\nprotective behaviour of washing hands before touching\neyes, nose or mouth.\nSmoking quit attempt\nPast‐year smokers who reported that they had made a quit\nattempt in the last 3 months were asked if their attempt\nwas triggered by (i) the COVID‐19 outbreak or (ii) concern\nabout future health problems.\nVaping quit attempt\nCurrent e‐cigarette users were asked if they were trying to\nquit vaping completely because of the COVID‐19 outbreak.\nSmoking inside the home\nSmokers were asked whether, in the past month, they had\nbeen smoking more, the same amount or fewer cigarettes\ninside their home.\nChildren in household\nSmokers were asked the number of children they had in\ntheir household. Responses were dichotomized as ≥1 and\n0.\nSES\nOccupation‐based social grade [24] was used as our\nmeasure of SES, with responses dichotomized into ABC1\n(managerial, professional and clerical workers) and C2DE\n(manual and casual workers, state pensioners and\nunemployed).\nPotential confounders\nIn addition to SES, we included information on sex, age and\nregion (London, North, Central, South)—variables proba-\nbly associated with smoking status, e‐cigarette use, NRT\nuse and COVID‐19 [18,20,25].\nAnalysis\nAll analyses were conducted in R version 3.5 [26]. The\npre‐registered analysis plan is available on the Open\nScience Framework (https://osf.io/vb9fm/). We made one\namendment, which was to include data from May 2020\nwhen these became available.

Large effects in either direction were\ndeﬁned as having an OR = 4 or for lower estimates ¼,\nbased on evidence that current smoking rates among\npatients hospitalized for COVID‐19 in China were four\ntimes lower than would be expected from the smoking\nprevalence in the country [6]. We deﬁned a medium\neffect size as OR = 2 or ½ and a small effect size as\nOR = 1.5 or ⅔.\nA1: Logistic regression was used to estimate the associa-\ntion between self‐reported COVID‐19 and (i) smoking\nstatus, (ii) e‐cigarette use and (iii) NRT use, with and\nwithout adjustment for potential confounders.

For\nsmokers, we also compared this to the proportion\nwho attempted to quit because they were concerned\nabout their future health.\nA4: We also report the proportion of smokers, with or\nwithout children in their household, who were\nsmoking more, less or the same amount inside their\nhome. Logistic regression was used to estimate the as-\nsociation of smoking more (versus less/about the\nsame amount) inside the home with children in\nhousehold, SES and the interaction between SES\nand children in the household.\nRESULTS\nOf the 3285 participants interviewed, 3179 (96.8%)\nprovided complete data on all questions required for the\ncurrent analyses.

Participants reported high engage-\nment in other hand‐washing behaviours, regardless of\nsmoking status, e‐cigarette use or NRT use. Of past‐year\nsmokers who made a recent quit attempt, 12.2% were\nmotivated to do so by COVID‐19 and a similar proportion\n(11.2%) of current e‐cigarette users attempted to quit\nvaping due to COVID‐19.

In this study we found that,\ncompared with never smokers, current smokers and\nlong‐term ex‐smokers had greater odds of self‐reported\nCOVID‐19. Recent ex‐smokers also had greater odds of\nself‐reported COVID‐19, but not signiﬁcantly so. These\nﬁndings suggest that one of the two explanations other\nthan infection are likely to account for the lower than\nexpected smoking rates among those hospitalized for\nCOVID‐19.\nHowever,\nsee\nbelow\nfor\nan\nalternative\ninterpretation.\nIn terms of infection, the most parsimonious interpreta-\ntion of the current ﬁndings is that current smokers and\nlong‐term ex‐smokers are at increased risk of SARS‐CoV‐2\ninfection, independent of a variety of socio‐demographic\nfactors. This increased risk could be the result of behaviour\nor biology. A relevant behaviour is that smoking requires\nrepeated hand‐to‐mouth actions, although we found no\nequivalent association with e‐cigarette use, which involves\nsimilar behaviours. In terms of biology, smoking has been\nassociated with upregulation of ACE2, the receptor for the\nvirus in the lung, which would provide a mechanism for\nincreased risk. However, other studies argue the relation-\nship between smoking and ACE2 is more complicated,\nand may vary between epithelial or alveolar cells [29,30].\nThe alternative explanation is that smokers are more likely\nto self‐report COVID‐19, but that this does not reﬂect an\nincreased infection risk. Instead, these differences could\nresult from smokers and long‐term ex‐smokers having\ngreater susceptibility to other infections with similar symp-\ntoms to COVID‐19 [3]. Consistent with this explanation is\nthat current compared with never smoking is associated\nwith reduced risk of testing positive among people tested\nin the community [5,31]. In order to resolve these compet-\ning explanations for our observation that smokers had\ngreater odds of reporting suspected COVID‐19, future\nstudies need to assess the seroprevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2\ninfection by smoking status in large, representative,\nrandomly selected samples of the population.\nBeyond smoking, the current ﬁndings are also difﬁcult\nto reconcile with nicotine being substantially protective\nagainst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Bayes factors indicated that\nthere was sufﬁcient evidence to rule out large differences in\nself‐reported COVID‐19 by NRT use and medium differ-\nences by e‐cigarette use. However, the current study was\nnot able to address the possibility that nicotine may protect\nagainst the development of more severe COVID‐19 disease\namong people who become infected.\nProtective behaviours, such as hand‐washing, are im-\nportant in slowing the transmission of infections like\nSARS‐CoV‐2. Here we found that, regardless of smoking\nstatus or nicotine use, the majority of respondents\n(> 85%) reported that they wash their hands most of the\ntime after coming home, before preparing food and before\neating. Fewer people reported washing their hands most\nof the time before touching their face, and recent\nex‐smokers had signiﬁcantly lower odds than never\nsmokers of reporting doing so.

Avoiding face‐touching with-\nout ﬁrst washing one’s hands could therefore be an\nimportant\nand\nunderstudied\nbehaviour\nto\nreduce\ntransmission [12].\nPublic health bodies have advised smokers that quitting\nmay reduce their risk of severe COVID‐19 outcomes [15].\nThis advice is based on the observation that despite being\nhospitalized at lower than expected rates, current smoking\nis associated with greater disease severity among those\nwho are hospitalized [5]. This advice has been shared\nthrough the news and in social media campaigns, such\nas ‘#QuitForCovid’ in the United Kingdom [14,33]. Here,\nwe found that, while COVID‐19 triggered quit attempts\namong some smokers in England, far more attempts were\ntriggered by other reasons such as future health concerns.\nThis is consistent with recently published results showing\nno increase in (i) internet searches for quitting smoking\n[34] or (ii) downloads of a popular smoking cessation appli-\ncation in the United Kingdom [35] following COVID‐19. It\nis possible that conﬂicting news stories, reporting the possi-\nbility that smoking is protective against COVID‐19 [36,37],\nmay have partially undermined attempts to encourage\npeople to quit smoking. Some organizations have also ad-\nvised people to stop vaping, arguing that e‐cigarette use\nmakes one susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection—despite\nlittle evidence to support this [5,16]. In our sample, one\nin 10 current e‐cigarette users attempted to quit vaping\ndue to concerns about COVID‐19. These attempts to quit\nvaping might stem from the deteriorating perceptions\nabout the harms associated with e‐cigarette use among\nsmokers in England [38,39].\nThere was a concern that social distancing measures\nmight increase the amount people smoke inside their\nhome, especially for disadvantaged individuals who may\nlive in housing without easy access to outdoor smoking\nareas. Reassuringly, we found that the majority of partici-\npants reported smoking the same number of cigarettes in-\nside the home, and equal numbers reported smoking\nmore or fewer cigarettes. There was no signiﬁcant associa-\ntion between smoking more inside the home and SES or\nchildren in the household. However, given our small sam-\nple and the wide conﬁdence intervals, we may have lacked\nsufﬁcient data to detect differences.\nThis study beneﬁts from using a representative sample\nof the population in England, including questions about\ncurrent e‐cigarette and NRT use, and distinguishing be-\ntween never, current, recent ex‐smokers and long‐term\nex‐smokers. However, there were a number of limitations.\nFirst, for some comparisons, sample sizes were small, which\nmeant that there was substantial uncertainly in estimates.\nSecondly, our measure of COVID‐19 was self‐reported, and\nnot conﬁrmed with a viral or antibody test. Given that\nmany other infections share symptoms with COVID‐19,\nsome participants may have misdiagnosed themselves. In\naddition, it is likely that most participants with asymptom-\natic cases did not report being infected. Thirdly, individuals\nwith the most severe cases of COVID‐19 were probably\nmissing from our analysis, because they may have died or\nbeen hospitalized. Thus, if nicotine reduces the risk of se-\nvere symptoms, fewer infected nicotine users would be\nmissing from the analysis than non‐users, leading to an up-\nward bias in the OR between these groups. However, at its\npeak, only 0.02% of the UK population were in hospital\nwith COVID‐19 [40]. This means that this sampling bias\nprobably had a negligible effect on the estimated propor-\ntion of participants with self‐reported COVID‐19, which\nranged from 14.5% of never smokers to 22.2% of recent\nex‐smokers. Fourthly, social desirability bias may have led\nparticipants\nto\nover‐report\ntheir\nengagement\nin\nhand‐washing in order to be viewed favourably by their in-\nterviewer.\nFifthly,\nbecause\nreported\nengagement\nin\nhand‐washing was so high, there may have been a ceiling\neffect whereby we were unable to detect differences by\nsmoking status, e‐cigarette use or NRT use. Sixthly, only\ncurrent e‐cigarette users were asked whether they had\nattempted to quit vaping because of concerns about\nCOVID‐19, which meant that we did not capture those\nwho had already quit vaping. Finally, there was no a priori\nsample size calculation, but we mitigated against this by\ncalculating Bayes factors for nonsigniﬁcant results.\nIn conclusion, these results do not support the\nhypothesis that smoking or nicotine is protective against\nCOVID‐19, with current smokers and long‐term ex‐\nsmokers having signiﬁcantly greater odds of self‐reported\nCOVID‐19 than never smokers in adjusted analyses and\nno signiﬁcant difference in odds of self‐reported COVID‐19\nby use of e‐cigarettes or NRT. With the exception of wash-\ning hands before touching one’s face, there was high\nengagement in hand‐washing irrespective of nicotine prod-\nuct use. Approximately one in 10 current e‐cigarette users\nreported attempting to quit vaping due to COVID‐19.

It is phylo-\ngenetically similar to SARS-CoV, with approxi-\nmately 80% of the genome consistency (1). SARS-\nCoV-2 enters the human body mainly through the \nrespiratory system. Clinical symptoms mainly in-\nclude fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Some patients \nare accompanied by nasal congestion, runny nose, \nsore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. The vast majori-\nty of cases are mild, but some patients have severe \ndisease outcomes by COVID-19 infection. The \npneumonia in these cases progresses rapidly and \nmay evolution into severe or critical forms of \nCOVID-19. They began to show symptoms of \nrespiratory failure requiring ventilator-assisted \nventilation. If the condition continues to deterio-\nrate, the patient may experience shock or even \ndeath (2). \nCurrently, known risk factors related to the \nprogression of COVID-19 to critical illness \ninclude: over 65 yr old; frequent hospitaliza-\ntions; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; \nmoderate to severe asthma; severe or decom-\npensated cardiac insufficiency; severe hyper-\ntension; using immunosuppressive drugs; \nuremia; high-risk pregnancy; severe obesity \n(BMI> 40); chronic liver disease, etc. (3). In \naddition, COVID-19 may also cause vascular \nendothelial dysfunction, leading to severe co-\nagulation abnormalities and thrombosis (4).  \nAbstract \nAt present, COVID-19 continues to spread around the world. People are generally susceptible to SARS-\nCoV-2. The elderly, serious chronic underlying diseases, high-risk pregnancy, severe obesity and other factors \nare related to the progression of COVID-19 to severe, critical illness, and even death caused by deterioration \nof the disease. The relationship between smoking and COVID-19 seems to be controversial. The smoking \nrate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is significantly lower than that of the general population. Therefore, \nsmoking can reduce COVID-19 infection and protect the respiratory tract. Subsequently, many scholars have \ncarried out research on this, thinking that this is a wrong and misleading conclusion. According to WHO, \nsmoking is significantly related to the severity of COVID-19, which is one of the important risk factors for \nthe deterioration and poor prognosis of COVID-19. This article reviews the mechanism of smoking increas-\ning the risk of COVID-19 infection. \n \nKeywords: COVID-19; Virus; Smoking \nHe et al.: Mechanisms in Which Smoking Increases the Risk … \n \nAvailable at:    http://ijph.tums.ac.ir                                                                                                        432 \nHowever, until now, in the global guidelines for \ncontrol of COVID-19, smoking has not been \nlisted as one of the important risk factors. Since \nthe outbreak of COVID-19, the relationship \nbetween smoking and COVID-19 seems to be \nvery controversial. The cause of the controversy \nis that there are clinical data from multiple stud-\nies suggesting that the proportion of smokers \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients is sig-\nnificantly lower than that of the general popula-\ntion. From the initial data from China (5,6), to \nlater data from many countries including Italy, \nSpain, and the United States, all indicate that the \nsmoking rate of COVID-19 hospitalized pa-\ntients is significantly lower than that of the gen-\neral population (7-9). Smoking can reduce the \nrisk of contracting COVID-19 and has a protec-\ntive effect on the respiratory tract. In a meta-\nanalysis of 5 clinical data from China, the com-\nbined odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 progres-\nsion between smokers and non-smokers was \n1.69 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.41-6.92) \n(10). Based on this, \"Active smoking is not asso-\nciated with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 \n(COVID-19)\". In addition, the authors hold that \nsmoking is a double-edged sword for COVID-\n19, while smokers are susceptible to COVID-19, \nsmoking may also have a protective effect on \nthe respiratory tract (11).  \nThis study has been widely disseminated in sci-\nentific literature, the lay press and various online \nsocial networks, especially cited, posted or \ntweeted by researchers or subjects funded by the \ntobacco industry. This conclusion may make the \npublic mistakenly believe that smoking can pre-\nvent COVID-19, and may mislead researchers \nand lead to research bias. Because in the two \nsubsequent meta-analysis on the impact of \nsmoking on COVID-19, researchers have cited \nthese conclusions as the basis for the negative \n(12, 13). Nicotine may be used as a new therapy \nfor COVID-19 and began to study its mecha-\nnism of protect the respiratory tract from infec-\ntion (7). \nSmoking is the main risk factor for respiratory \ninfection and disease progression. Smokers are \nmore susceptible to influenza than non-smokers \nare, especially severe influenza are. The rate of \ninfluenza/bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis \nin smokers has doubled compared with non-\nsmokers (14). According to research reports on \nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus \n(MERS), smoking is an important risk factor for \nMERS-CoV infection and is associated with the \nhigh mortality rate of MERS (15). Therefore, \nlong-term smoking destroys the defense mecha-\nnism of the respiratory system and easily leads to \nrespiratory infections, which is the consensus of \neveryone. COVID-19 is now the only respirato-\nry tract infectious disease that is not affected by \nsmoking. This phenomenon is difficult to ex-\nplain, because COVID-19 does show obvious \ninvasiveness to the respiratory tract. \nFirstly, how to explain that the rate of smoking \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients is sig-\nnificantly lower than that of the general popula-\ntion. A meta-analysis of 28 published studies by \nresearchers (16) found that 25 of them did not \nrecord the smoking history of patients. There-\nfore, it is questionable whether the non-smokers \nin the study have never smoked. Secondly, in \nsome surveys, smoking status was divided into \n\"smokers\", \"ex-smokers\" and \"non-smokers and \nthose with missing information on smoking”. It \nis misleading to classify \"non-smokers\" and \n\"smokers with missing information\" into the \nsame category, which will lead the author to \nwrong conclusions. In addition, these 28 studies \nare all retrospective analysis. The clinical data \nused in these studies were obtained in an epide-\nmiological context. Most of the data did not \nhighlight smoking history. Therefore, the con-\nsistency and accuracy of the smoker status in \nmost research records cannot be guaranteed. \nDue to the emergency of COVID-19, the smok-\ning status of patients may not be accurately rec-\norded. For example, some patients may already \nbe in a critical state when they are hospitalized \nand cannot report their smoking status (17), this \nmay lead to an underestimation of the number \nof smokers. Besides, smokers with severe \nCOVID-19 symptoms may have quit smoking \nbefore being hospitalized and therefore are not \nrecorded as smokers. However, the WHO defi-\nIran J Public Health, Vol. 50, No.3, Mar 2021, pp.431-437  \n433                                                                                                        Available at:    http://ijph.tums.ac.ir \nnition of \"ex-smoker\" means quitting smoking \nfor at least 6 months. Therefore, incomplete or \nincorrect information on the smoking history of \nhospitalized patients with COVID-19 may be \nthe main reason for the low rate of smokers \namong hospitalized patients in some researches.  \nMany researchers have questioned Lippi's re-\nsearch conclusions. Guo FR (17) pointed out \nthat four of the five clinical data used by Lippi et \nal. had defects in data collection, and the num-\nber of cases was wrong, which directly led to \nincorrect meta-analysis results. The statistical \nmethod used by Lippi et al. is wrong, and it is \ninappropriate to use the null hypothesis signifi-\ncance test method to conclude that there is no \ncorrelation (18). Moreover, Lippi et al. made a \ncommon statistical error in their conclusions. \nThat there is no statistically significant correla-\ntion between smoking and the severity of \nCOVID-19 does not mean that smoking is clini-\ncally unrelated to the severity of COVID-19 \n(19). Therefore, the incorrect meta-analysis \nmade by Lippi and Henry (10) led to misleading \nconclusions (20). This is the only research re-\nport, which concluded that there is no relation-\nship between smoking and the severity of \nCOVID-19. Since then, at least 17 meta-analyses \nhave been made for further research (12), \nproviding clear evidence of the direct relation-\nship between smoking and the severity and pro-\ngression of COVID-19. Compared with non-\nsmokers, smokers infected with COVID-19 are \n3.25 times more likely to develop severe and \ncritical illness (12). Smoking is clearly related to \nthe severity of COVID-19, and is one of the \nimportant risk factors for the worsening of \nCOVID-19 and poor prognosis. \nThe mechanisms by which smokers are suscep-\ntible to COVID-19 and the disease tends to de-\nteriorate include the following aspects (Fig.1).\n  \n \n \nFig. 1: Factors responsible for higher susceptibility of smokers against COVID-19 (Original) \nIn normal individuals, the first line of defense against exogenous pathogens is the mucociliary epithelium and mu-\ncous layers (in this review, COVID-19). When smoking, the clearance of this barrier is dysfunctional, which makes \nthem more susceptible to infection. ACE2 receptors (binding sites for COVID-19) allow pathogens to enter host \ncells and protects the virus from host surveillance, highly expressed on the surface of smokers. In normal individuals, \nthe virus infection could be detected in the following ways: (a) cytokines released from the type II pneumocytes, \ngoblet cells, nasal epithelial / ciliated and oral mucosal cells, and (b) immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils and \nlymphocytes) infiltrating the infection site in order to curb further transmission. Smoking can make it easier to enter \nthe host cells by weakening the immune system, and the virus multiplies rapidly followed by a hyperinflammatory \nresponse triggered by \"cytokine storm\" in the host body, resulting in damage to lung tissue eventually \nHe et al.: Mechanisms in Which Smoking Increases the Risk … \n \nAvailable at:    http://ijph.tums.ac.ir                                                                                                        434 \n1. Smoking increases the chance of viruses \nentering the body \nWhen a smoker is smoking, his hands repeatedly \ntouch his face, which increases the number of \nhand-to-mouth contacts and increases the \nchance of virus invading the human body. When \nsmoking or exercising, the breathing rate and \nrespiratory flow increases significantly. This \nleads to a change in the breathing state from the \nnose to the mouth, the mucosa of the respirato-\nry tract gradually cools and dries, the movement \nof ciliated cells decreases, and the viscosity of \nthe mucosa increases, resulting in a decrease in \nthe filtering function of the upper respiratory \ntract for microorganisms. Viruses are more likely \nto bypass the natural defense barriers of the oral \ncavity and upper respiratory tract and penetrate \ninto the lower respiratory tract and alveoli (21). \n \n2. Smoking affects the mucosal epithelial \nbarrier of the lung, leading to an increase in \nthe permeability of epithelial cells \nThe changes in lung structure caused by smok-\ning include increased mucosal permeability, wid-\nening of mucociliary spaces, peribronchial in-\nflammation and fibrosis (airway remodeling). \nThese pathological changes significantly reduce \nthe resistance of smokers to virus invasion. \nSmoking can cause serious effects on the respir-\natory tract of smokers, such as causing oxidative \nstress and inflammation in the lungs, leading to \ndysfunction of the epithelial barrier and signifi-\ncantly increasing the permeability of epithelial \ncells. ROS produced by oxidative stress can di-\nrectly affect the ACE2/angiotensin/adrenaline \naxis, increase the sensitivity of the respiratory \ntract to viral/bacterial infections, and make \nsmokers more susceptible to bacterial/viral in-\nfections (22). \n \n3. The role of epithelial cells and inflamma-\ntion: ACE2 and TMPSSR2 \nSARS-CoV 2 belongs to the coronavirus family. \nIt is named for its appearance similar to a \ncrown. This appearance is due to two functional \ndomains - S1 and S2 glycosylation of the spike \nprotein on the cell surface. ACE 2 has been \nproved the receptor for SARS-Cov-2 virus to \nenter the host cell (23). The S2 domain of the \nviral spike envelope has a high affinity for the \nACE 2 receptor of the lung epithelium. It has \nbeen found that smokers and patients taking \nACE antagonists (high blood pressure and dia-\nbetes) have higher expression of ACE 2 and are \ntherefore more susceptible to COVID-19 (24). \nIn addition, ACE 2 may be highly expressed in \ngerm cells, that is, males express more than fe-\nmales. Males have more circulating ACE 2 than \nfemales, which may provide evidence for gender \ndifferences in the severity of COVID-19. ACE 2 \nreceptors are widely distributed in lung epithelial \ncells, especially type II lung epithelial cells, gob-\nlet cells, nasal epithelial/ciliary cells, and oral \nmucosal cells (25). The SARS-CoV-2 response \nstimulated by interferon enters the cell through \nACE2 and TMPSSR 2 proteases (26). ACE 2 \nexpression is up-regulated in the small airway \nepithelium of smokers and patients with smok-\ning-related diseases such as COPD and IPF (26, \n27), so smokers are more likely to be infected \nwith COVID-19. Although the virus enters the \nhost cell mainly through ACE 2, the virus parti-\ncles need the activation of cell protease to pro-\nmote the phagocytosis of the virus. TMPRSS 2 \nprotease, which is highly expressed in nasal cili-\nated cells and goblet cells, plays an important \nrole in SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells. ACE2 \nuses cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 to act on \nS protein to invade host cells (26). In addition, \nthrough single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of \nmultiple tissues, it was found that only a small \npart of ACE2+ cells expresses TMPRSS2, which \nindicates that there may be other proteases that \nplay similar roles. Cathepsin B/L plays an equal-\nly important role when viruses invade cells (25). \nSmoking can increase the expression of cathep-\nsin B, which may be one of the reasons why \nsmokers are susceptible to COVID-19 (27). An-\nother cell protease is Furin, which can cleave the \nS1/S2 site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, \nwhich is essential for the spread of the virus be-\ntween cells. There is evidence that the lack of \nFurin increases the possibility of mice being in-\nfected with the virus (influenza A) (28). Serpin \nIran J Public Health, Vol. 50, No.3, Mar 2021, pp.431-437  \n435                                                                                                        Available at:    http://ijph.tums.ac.ir \nprotease inhibitor (Serpin) can regulate and con-\ntrol the activity of Furin protease. The activity of \nSerpin in smokers is reduced, which affects the \nactivity of Furin, so smokers are more suscepti-\nble to COVID-19 (29).  \n \n4. Smoking suppresses the body's immune \nsystem \nThe effects of smoking on the immune system \ninclude the following aspects: Firstly, smoking \ncan reduce the number of CD4 + T cells (helper \nT cells), which can promote B cells to produce \nantibodies and activate killer T cells to attack \npathogens. Secondly, nicotine, the main ingredi-\nent in tobacco products, can promote the secre-\ntion of catecholamines and corticosteroids, \nwhich will reduce the function of the immune \nsystem and inhibit the body’s ability to resist \nbacterial/viral infections. Thirdly, studies have \nshown that nicotine can inhibit the production \nof interleukin-22, which helps to inhibit lung \ninflammation and repair damaged cells (30). \n \n5. Smoking and \"cytokine storm\" \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is \none of the most common serious complications \nof SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is the result of a \n\"cytokine storm\" caused by the release of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines/chemokines from im-\nmune cells. The pro-inflammatory mediators \nreleased by immune cells include IP-10, MCP-3, \nHGF, MIG, MIP-1α, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, \nIL-7 and GM-CSF, etc. (31). In long-term \nsmokers, the expression of IL-6, TNF-α and \nother pro-inflammatory factors are increased, \nand the expression of two main effector pro-\nteins of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 T \nlymphocytes: perforin and granzyme B are re-\nduced. In addition, autopsy reports of COVID-\n19 patients showed that pulmonary capillaries \nwere infiltrated with neutrophils, accompanied \nby fibrin deposition, and neutrophils had extrav-\nasated into the alveolar cavity (32). This indi-\ncates that the formation of neutrophil extracellu-\nlar bactericidal networks (NETs) may be the \ncause of organ damage and lung structural re-\nmodeling in COVID-19 patients. Studies have \nshown that smoking can affect the transport of \nneutrophils, the formation of NETs, inhibit \nbody fluids and cell-mediated immune respons-\nes, and make the disease more likely to progress \nto ARDS, leading to worsening of the disease \n(32). \n \nConclusion \n \nSmoking increases the possibility of COVID-19 \ninfection and causes the disease to progress and \nworsen more easily. Nicotine seems to have the \npharmacological effect of inhibiting the growth \nof SARS-CoV-2. However, common basic dis-\neases that are susceptible to COVID-19, includ-\ning hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, \nCOPD, tumors, and chronic kidney disease, are \nall tobacco-related diseases. Therefore, smoking \nto prevent COVID-19 is tantamount to “drinking \npoison to quench thirst.” At present, COVID-19 \nis still spreading all over the world. How to effec-\ntively prevent and control it is an urgent problem. \nSmoking is probably the most important and \navoidable risk factor. Apart from preventing to-\nbacco-related diseases, smoking cessation can \nalso reduce the chance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \n \nEthical considerations  \n \nEthical issues (Including plagiarism, informed \nconsent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or fal-\nsification, double publication and/or submission, \nredundancy, etc.) have been completely observed \nby the authors.  \n \nConflict of interest \n \nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of \ninterest. \n \nReferences  \n  \n1.

While its disease course is incom-\npletely understood, its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, is thought to enter respiratory epithelial\ncells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in the lungs, resulting in a vari-\nety of clinical symptoms. Given the high infection rates worldwide, the identification of mark-\ners predicting increased disease severity may enable more effective triaging of patients and\nprocurement of resources.\nDue to its novelty and heterogeneity in presentation, the underlying mechanism for the\nsevere hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure sometimes seen in COVID-19 has been the\nsubject of controversy. The common features of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in combination\nwith low PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratios are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome\n(ARDS). However, other potential etiologies for COVID-19-related respiratory failure have\nbeen proposed, including an atypical, “high compliance” form of ARDS, high-altitude pulmo-\nnary edema, and other non-pulmonary causes of hypoxia, such as those caused by cardiomy-\nopathy [2–5]. The presence of various hypotheses for disease mechanism may be playing a role\nin the management and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure.\nWe present our cohort of the first 112 unique, consecutively admitted patients to our hospi-\ntal system with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our aim was to describe characteristics, man-\nagement, and trajectory of respiratory failure and mortality in our cohort, and to explore the\nfactors associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.\nMethods\nSetting, patient population, and study design\nThis is a retrospective observational cohort study conducted from March 12 2020 and April 16\n2020 approved by the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) institutional review board\nwith waiver of informed consent. We evaluated the first 113 unique admissions to our health-\ncare system. We originally accessed patient charts between March 12 and June 16th 2020. We\nreturned to the charts in October 2020 to extract elements requested during the review process.\nThe UCLA hospital system is an academic center in Los Angeles County comprised of Ronald\nReagan-UCLA Medical Center (RR-UCLA) and Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center (SM-U-\nCLA). RR-UCLA has 520 beds, of which 109 are critical care beds, while SM-UCLA has 281\nbeds, of which 22 are ICU beds. Hospitalized patients at RR-UCLA and SM-UCLA \u0015 18 years\nold with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from either nasal swab or mini-bronchoalveolar\nlavage (BAL) testing were included. Data for patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was\nmanually extracted from the electronic health record and included in a database.\nClinical protocols\nThis was an observational study, and all clinical management was left to the discretion of the\nprimary treatment team. A pandemic response team comprised of intensivists and infectious\ndisease specialists generated COVID-19 treatment guidance documents; recommendations\nemphasized established best critical care practices. Guidelines recommended intubation for\npatients who had PCR confirmed COVID-19 and who demonstrated rapid escalation of oxy-\ngen requirements. It was at the discretion of the clinician to decide whether a patient would\ntolerate a trial of non-invasive oxygen delivery via non-rebreather mask or high flow nasal\ncanula (HFNC). If the clinician decided that trial of these non-invasive therapies would place\nthe patient and/or staff at greater risk, the patient would proceed to intubation.\nPLOS ONE\nRespiratory failure in COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552\nDecember 22, 2020\n2 / 13\nFunding: ACM is funded by the National Institutes\nof Health (NIH) training grant T32 5T32HL072752-\n1 The funders had no role in study design, data\ncollection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting interests: I have read the journal’s\npolicy and the authors of this manuscript have the\nfollowing competing interests: SYC consults for\nPureTech on their deupirfenidone in COVID study.\nThis does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE\npolicies on sharing data and materials.\nRecommendations for patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nincluded low tidal volume ventilation with tidal volumes \u0014 6 mL/kg predicted body weight\n(PBW), goal plateau pressures under 30 cm H20 when possible, early consideration of prone\nventilation for patients with P/F ratios < 150, daily awakening trials or light sedation, and con-\nservative fluid management. Titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was recom-\nmended to reflect ARDS network PEEP tables [6–9].\nAll admitted patients with COVID-19 were considered for enrollment in interventional\nclinical trials. Clinical trials available at our centers from March 12, 2020 to April 16, 2020\nincluded those testing the therapeutic benefit of sarilumab (NCT04315298), remdesivir (NCT\n04280705), leronlimab (NCT04347239) and hydroxychloroquine (NCT04332991). In addition,\nduring this time, several patients received open-label remdesivir, leronlimab, hydroxychloro-\nquine and tocilizumab (S1 and S2 Tables in S1 File).\nPatient and public involvement\nThis was a de-identified chart review and as such no patients were directly involved.\nData collection\nBaseline demographic variables, smoking history, comorbidities, and body mass index (BMI)\nwere collected. Inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin,\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and highly-sensitive Interleukin-6 (IL-6); and other labs such as\nhemoglobin A1c, troponin, procalcitonin and a white blood cell count with differential were\nobtained on admission, or on day of COVID-19 diagnosis if the cause of the original admis-\nsion was unrelated to confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Treatment-level variables collected\nincluded use of anticoagulation, enrollment in clinical trials, as well as the use of open-label\ndirected therapies for COVID-19, which included hydroxychloroquine, tocilizimab, leronli-\nmab, and remdesivir. For those patients on mechanical ventilation, ventilator and respiratory\nparameters were collected, as were the use of adjunctive ARDS therapies, including prone\npositioning, neuromuscular blockade, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal support.\nOutcomes data that were collected included 60 day in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, rate\nof endotracheal intubation, ICU length of say, hospital length of stay, and duration of mechan-\nical ventilation. We defined adherence to lung protective ventilation as the use of tidal volume\n(VT) < 8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW).\nDefinitions\nWe identified patients who had ARDS as defined by the Berlin Criteria—P/F ratio < 300 with\nchest imaging revealing bilateral opacities that could not be exclusively explained by cardio-\ngenic causes [10]. We extracted smoking status from the admission note. Patients were inter-\nviewed about smoking history on admission. Never smokers, prior smokers and current\nsmokers were self-identified as such by the patients during the interview. Those patients who\nself-identified as prior smokers were then asked when they last smoked and number of packs a\nday. Those who identified as current smokers were asked the number of packs smoked a day.\nPatients who smoked less than a pack-year were considered never smokers. Diagnosis of\nvenous thromboembolism (VTE) was considered present if there was documented radio-\ngraphic evidence of either pulmonary embolism (via computerized tomography) or deep\nvenous thrombosis (via ultrasound). We defined mortality as death during the first 60 days of\ninpatient hospitalization. Any admission to the ICU or any intubation for respiratory failure,\nregardless of duration, was included in the rate of ICU admissions and intubations,\nrespectively.\nPLOS ONE\nRespiratory failure in COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552\nDecember 22, 2020\n3 / 13\nStatistical methods\nWe combined key categorical variables so that smoking history was evaluated as present, for-\nmer, or never-smoker, and comorbidities as no known medical history versus any past medical\nhistory. We also evaluated these categorical variables in all their individual categories when\nproviding descriptive statistics. Race/ethnicity was defined as White, Black, Latinx, Asian, or\nother. Descriptive statistics employing simple mean, median and interquartile range were used\nfor the baseline characteristics of the whole cohort and by intubation status. Two-by-two tables\nwere used to describe outcomes of selected subgroups. Chi-squared analysis was used to assess\nstatistical significance between categorical variables, two sample t-test and two sample Wil-\ncoxon Rank-Sum tests were used to assess statistical significance between continuous variables.\nWilcoxon Rank-Sum test was used when the total number was low and the assumption of a\nnormal distribution was not met.\nMultivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the contribution of selected baseline\ncharacteristics of the cohort to the odds of the binary outcome of requiring mechanical ventila-\ntion. Past medical history with cohort prevalence of >15% were used in the multivariable\nmodel. We also explored association between selected pro-inflammatory markers and odds of\nrequiring mechanical ventilation by using univariate logistic regression models for each bio-\nmarker. Multivariable analysis was not used for biomarkers because of significant co-linearity\nbetween the inflammatory markers. We established a threshold of 15% missingness for key\nvariables of interest a priori to trigger multiple imputation, which was not met for any variable\nin our analyses.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nWe evaluated the first 113 unique admissions to our healthcare system with confirmed\nCOVID-19 infection, as diagnosed between March 12, 2020 and April 16, 2020. We excluded\none patient who incidentally tested positive for COVID-19 but died from complications from\na motor vehicle collision before COVID-directed inpatient management was initiated.\nAmong the remaining 112 patients, the median age was 61 years old (IQR 45–74) and sub-\njects were predominantly male (66%). The cohort was 44% White, 29% Latinx, 8% Asian, 6%\nBlack, and 13% other. The majority (84%) had a known comorbidity on admission, with the\nmost frequent comorbidities being diabetes (65%), hypertension (50%), obesity (36%), chronic\nkidney disease (17%), and coronary artery disease (15%) (Table 1). Of our cohort, 27% were\ntaking either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as an outpatient, and\n7% were health care workers. Four patients were admitted as a transfer from an outside hospi-\ntal for higher level of care. Out of the 47 ICU admissions, the median APACHE II score on\narrival to the ICU was 12 (IQR 7–16, mean 12.7, SD 7.11).\nRate of admissions\nAs of April 17, the day after the last COVID diagnosis for this cohort, there were 11,391 con-\nfirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Los Angeles County. During this period, there were 113\nunique COVID related admissions in our hospital system at a rate of 1–8 patients per day. The\npeak number of new COVID-related admissions was 8 on April 3rd (S1 Fig in S1 File).\nInflammatory markers on admission\nOur cohort had a notable elevation of pro-inflammatory markers on presentation without an\nelevated white blood count (median 6.25 x 103/μL IQR 4.75–8.55 x 103/μL). Median\nPLOS ONE\nRespiratory failure in COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552\nDecember 22, 2020\n4 / 13\ninterleukin-6 level was 9 pg/ml on admission (upper limit of normal for assay <5 pg/mL)\n(IQR 2–23 pg/ml), median D-dimer was 1140 ng/ml (IQR 677–2073 ng/ml), and median ferri-\ntin level was 696 ng/ml (IQR = 357–1616 ng/ml). The median absolute lymphocyte count was\n0.9 x 103/μL, (IQR 0.58–1.18 x 103/μL), median CRP was 7.8 mg/dl (IQR 3.2–12.65 mg/dl),\nmedian LDH was 324 U/L (IQR 239–423), and median procalcitonin was 0.12 ug/L (IQR\n0–0.385 ug/L) (Table 2).\nTable 1.

Of\nthe 112 patients, all had completed disposition at the time of this report. The rate of in-hospital\n60-day mortality for our total cohort was 6% (7/112) with an ICU mortality of 12.8% (6/47),\nand a mortality of 18% (5/28) for those who required endotracheal intubation. Two patients\nreceived CPR, neither of whom achieved return of spontaneous circulation. Of the 7 patients\nwho died, 2 had a do not resuscitate (DNR) order documented in the chart at the time of\nadmission. Median ICU length of stay (LOS) was 7 days (IQR 3–15 days).\nCourse of respiratory failure\nWe evaluated individual patients’ trajectories of respiratory failure. High-flow nasal cannula\n(HFNC) was required for 11 patients, of whom 45% progressed to intubation. Conversely, of\nthose who were intubated, only 18% were previously on HFNC. Baseline factors associated with\nneed for intubation were obesity (OR 5.82, p = 0.004), former smoker status (OR 8.06, p = 0.02),\nand current smoking status (OR 10.33, p = 0.02), as per multivariable logistic regression analysis\nadjusting for age, sex, and high prevalence comorbidities (Table 3 and Fig 1). Additionally, the\nproinflammatory markers IL-6, ferritin, LDH and CRP, drawn on admission or on day of\nCOVID-19 diagnosis for patients already hospitalized at the time of positive PCR, were associ-\nated with higher odds of intubation by univariate analysis (Table 3). The absolute lymphocyte\ncount was also associated with need for mechanical ventilation (OR of 0.33, CI 0.11–0.96).\nOut of the 28 patients intubated, 24 patients were diagnosed with ARDS (21% of our total\ncohort), and 21 patients had a P/F ratio < 150 (19% of our total cohort). An additional three\npatients had bilateral opacities and required HFNC. The ICU LOS was significantly greater\namongst patients with ARDS. Those with ARDS had an ICU LOS of 15 days (IQR 9–24 days)\nwhile those without ARDS had an ICU LOS of 5 days (IQR 2–5 days; difference with p< 0.01).\nTable 3.

In our cohort, 54% of patients were either enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial or\nreceived open label use of one or more of the following therapies: anti-IL-6 therapy (sarilumab\nor tocilizumab), CCR5 antagonist (leronlimab), hydroxychloroquine, or remdesivir (S1 and S2\nTables in S1 File). Mortality between the patients who received at least one of these interven-\ntions/studies was statistically similar to those who were not subject to open label interventions\nor trial enrollment, with 2 deaths in the group of 60 patients enrolled in a trial or receiving\nopen label therapy versus 5 deaths out of the 52 who did not (p = 0.171 by chi squared, unad-\njusted analysis). The correlation of any individual therapy with mortality could not be deter-\nmined due to the overall low mortality rate of our cohort.\nTreatment guidance at our institution recommended the use of pharmacologic VTE prophy-\nlaxis on all patients unless contraindicated. Therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE was recom-\nmended only in the case of confirmed or highly suspected VTE. In our cohort, 26/112 received\ntherapeutic dose anticoagulation; 25 of these patients (96%) had a known indication for therapeu-\ntic anticoagulation, with only 1 patient receiving anticoagulation empirically. Indications for\nFig 1. Forest plot of multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities with cohort prevalence of \u001515%.

Eleven patients had suspected or confirmed acute thromboembolic events during\ntheir hospitalization, including deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus (6 patients), fre-\nquent clotting of dialysis catheters (2 patients), acute coronary syndrome (1 patients), ischemic\ndigit (1 patient), or left ventricular thrombus (1 patient) (S3 Table in S1 File). Of the 6 patients\n(5.4%) who developed radiographically-confirmed VTE, 2 were diagnosed at the time of admis-\nsion. Of the 4 who later developed VTE, all were on VTE prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis.\nThree of the patients with radiographically-confirmed VTE had ARDS. None of the patients with\nnew VTE died during their hospitalization. Mortality was not significantly different amongst\nthose receiving and not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (4% v. 7%, χ2 p = 0.563).\nWhile there has been debate about the use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 at the\ntime of data collection, our institutional treatment guidance did not recommend routine ste-\nroids for COVID-19 related ARDS in the absence of another indication during this time\nperiod. From our cohort, 11/112 received steroid doses that exceeded 20 mg of prednisone\nequivalents daily. Of those, 10/11 had an indication based on past medical history (e.g., chronic\nsteroid use), new adrenal insufficiency, or refractory shock.\nARDS management\nIn patients who developed ARDS, we examined the rate of adherence to lung protective venti-\nlation and the frequency of adjunctive therapy use. Patients with ARDS had a median tidal vol-\nume of 6.1 cc/kg PBW on day 1. The pooled median tidal volumes per PBW in days 2–7 varied\nfrom 5.9 to 6.1 (Fig 2). Outliers with larger tidal volumes tended to be those patients placed on\npressure support. Adherence to LPV (<8cc/kg PBW) was 90.2% for ventilator days 1–7. We\nalso evaluated the use of PEEP in our cohort. For patients with mild to moderate ARDS (P/\nF > 150, n = 3), median PEEP was between 5–10 cmH2O depending on the day for the first 7\ndays of mechanical ventilation. For moderate to severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 150, n = 21),\nmedian daily PEEP was 10–12 cmH2O for the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation.\nOut of 21 patients with ARDS and P/F ratio < 150, 12 patients (57%) underwent prone\npositioning at least once. Among those with available data (n = 9), the P/F ratio improved by\nan average of 63 points (SD 84) after the first proning event. In addition, out of the 28 intu-\nbated patients, 14/28 (50%) received neuromuscular blockade outside of rapid sequence intu-\nbation. For the intubated patients, compliance on day of intubation (day 1) had a median\nvalue of 34.1 ml/cm H2O (IQR = 24.6–41.8, mean 34.0, SD 10.4), for day 3 the median was\n30.3 (IQR 23.9–40.1, mean 32.7, SD 10.4), for day 5 the median was 34.6 (IQR 26.9–39.9, mean\n35.4, SD 12.4) and for day 7 the median was 34.7 (IQR 30.7–52.5, mean 38.8, SD 11.7). Only a\nminority (2/28) of intubated patients received inhaled nitric oxide at any point, and only one\npatient received veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO).\nDiscussion\nIn this retrospective, observational study, we report lower hospital mortality in both critically\nand non-critically ill patients at our center in comparison with prior published cohorts.\nPatient-level characteristics associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation included\nobesity, past and present smoking history, and elevation of pro-inflammatory markers. Further\nunderstanding of the factors associated with clinical deterioration may help identify therapeu-\ntic targets for early intervention.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study identifying obesity and smoking history as risk fac-\ntors for the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19. While obesity has been\nPLOS ONE\nRespiratory failure in COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552\nDecember 22, 2020\n8 / 13\nassociated with increased risk for a positive COVID-19 test [11], and an association between\nobesity and mortality in COVID-19 has been speculated [12,13], its association with respiratory\noutcomes in COVID-19 has not been directly evaluated. On the other hand, the impact of\nsmoking in COVID-19 disease severity may be explained by the observation that smokers have\nupregulation of ACE2 receptors on lung biopsy [14,15]. Indeed, a large observational cohort\nfrom Wuhan reported a higher rate of smoking among patients with more severe forms of\nCOVID-19 [16]. In addition, a smaller study revealed a higher adjusted risk for disease progres-\nsion in patients with a history of smoking compared to never smokers [17]. Metanalyses evalu-\nating the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 disease severity have had mixed results.\nA smaller evaluation of five published cohorts from China did not find a statistically significant\nassociation between active smoking and disease severity; however the analysis was unadjusted\n[18]. A larger metanalysis found that current or former smoking was associated higher unad-\njusted risk for the composite outcome of ICU admission, intubation or death in COVID-19\n[19]. None of the included studies examined adjusted risk for IMV [19,20].\nOverall mortality in our patient population was low. While the factors associated with mor-\ntality remain unclear, this finding is encouraging. This cohort shared some similarities to oth-\ners, including a majority of male patients (66%) [16,21–24], a median age of 61 [21,23,24], and\nan admission rate of 56% non-white minorities [24]. We also report comparable rates of\nFig 2. Box and whisker plot of pooled cohort mechanical ventilation tidal volume for first 7 days post-intubation.

Box represents IQR and whiskers represent minimum and maximum, with outliers represented as dots.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552.g002\nPLOS ONE\nRespiratory failure in COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552\nDecember 22, 2020\n9 / 13\ninvasive mechanical ventilation to other cohorts [21,24]. However, the role of baseline severity\nof illness was not fully assessed, and has not been extensively detailed in prior studies. As such,\nit is possible that our patient population was less ill than others.\nIn our ventilated patients, the in-hospital mortality rate was 18%, which was similar to the\nrate seen in a recently published study, but lower than that seen in earlier cohorts [23–25]. The\nvast majority of mechanically ventilated patients in our cohort had ARDS, suggesting that opti-\nmizing ARDS care may improve the outcomes of these patients. ARDS is traditionally under-\ndiagnosed worldwide, and prior studies demonstrate the underutilization of therapies known\nto reduce mortality in this syndrome [26,27].\nBoth lung protective ventilation and prone positioning have been associated with improved\noutcomes in ARDS and are recommended by multiple professional society guidelines\n[6,7,28,29]. Our adherence to lung protective ventilation strategies (90.2% for ventilator days\n1–7) was higher than that reported in previous large multicenter ARDS cohorts [27,30]. Prone\npositioning was also used almost 60% of the time compared with 8–11% in prior reports\n[26,27]. While we were unable to definitively correlate any individual therapeutic measure\nwith mortality given the small size of our cohort, adherence to established ARDS best practices\nmay have played a role. It is also likely that the lower per capita incidence of COVID-19 in our\nstate [31] and the lack of strain in our system enabled adherence to these labor-intensive inter-\nventions for ARDS. Indeed, as of the time of this writing, there was no change to usual staffing\nratios, or need for non-ICU clinicians to take care of ICU level patients. Although this finding\nwarrants further investigation, it may suggest that efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19\nas a means to avoid straining healthcare systems may indeed be an effective strategy for con-\ntrolling mortality from this disease.\nRegarding features that may be specific to COVID-19, there have been several reports of\nhigh rates of coagulopathy and VTE in these patients [32–34]. Post-mortem studies revealed a\nhigh rate of microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients [35]. Microvas-\ncular damage and thrombi formation are in fact well documented in ARDS [36,37]. We found a\nlow rate of VTE (5%) in our patient population. While VTE was not a focus of our study, some\nmitigating factors associated with its seemingly low incidence in our cohort may include a high\nuse of VTE prophylaxis, as well as recommendations by our pandemic response team for daily\nawakenings, light sedation, and regular consultation with physical and occupational therapy.\nRecent reports have also suggested that COVID-19 produces an excessive inflammatory\nresponse by the host. Indeed, IL-6 and serum ferritin, traditionally elevated in proinflamma-\ntory conditions, have been associated with higher mortality in patients infected with COVID-\n19 [16]. In this cohort, ferritin and IL-6 also correlated with increased rates of endotracheal\nintubation, but no definitive correlation with mortality could be made. Given the concern that\nexcessive inflammatory response may play a role in mortality, multiple clinical trials have been\ninitiated to inhibit a number of targets including interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and granulocyte-\nmacrophage-colony stimulating factor. While a large portion of our patients were enrolled in\nclinical trials, the impact of these agents remains to be seen.\nThe strengths of this study included manual extraction of all data points, which allowed for\nhigher accuracy and granularity of findings. In addition, the in-hospital mortality was known for\nall of our patients. Study weaknesses included the single center nature and small sample size,\nwhich precluded more robust evaluation of risk factors associated with mortality. In addition,\nshort follow up times precluded the assessment of disease sequela in our cohort. We also did not\ncollect information on social determinants of health such as education level, insurance status or\neconomic factors, all of which could have influenced observed outcomes. Finally, given its retro-\nspective nature, we also cannot ascertain that any of our interventions directly affected patient\noutcomes. Nevertheless, our data identified potential risk factors for disease progression.\nPLOS ONE\nRespiratory failure in COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238552\nDecember 22, 2020\n10 / 13\nConclusion\nEarly experience with COVID-19 at UCLA has revealed a lower mortality than previously\nreported. Baseline factors associated with increased odds for the need for mechanical ventilation\ninclude obesity and smoking history; further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger,\nmulticenter cohorts. Finally, the incidence of ARDS among intubated patients with COVID-19 is\nhigh, suggesting that optimizing ARDS care may improve the outcomes of these patients.\nSupporting information\nS1 File.\n(PDF)\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Ana C.

Both groups received brief cessation advice at baseline. The intervention \ngroup received messaging on smoking-related COVID-19 risk and cessation support \nvia instant messaging for three months (16 messages in total), which highlighted \nthe increased risk of severe COVID-19 and deaths, and potentially higher risk of \nviral exposure (e.g. due to mask removal) for smokers. The control group received \ngeneric text messaging support for three months (16 messages). The primary \noutcomes were biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) \nat 3 and 6 months. Intention to treat analyses was used.\nRESULTS Between 13 June and 30 October 2020, 1166 participants were randomly \nassigned to an intervention (n=583) or control (n=583) group. By intention-to-\ntreat, validated 7-day PPA did not significantly differ between the intervention \nand control groups at three months (9.6% and 11.8%, relative risk, RR=0.81; \n95% CI: 0.58–1.13, p=0.22) or six months (9.3% and 11.7%, RR=0.79; 95% CI: \n0.57–1.11, p=0.18). A higher perceived severity of COVID-19 in smokers at \nbaseline was associated with a greater validated 7-day PPA at six months, and a \nmarginally significant intervention effect on changes in perceived severity from \nbaseline through 6 months was found (p for group × time interaction = 0.08).\nCONCLUSIONS Communicating smoking-related COVID-19 risk via instant messaging \nwas not more effective in increasing smoking abstinence than generic cessation \nsupport.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04399967\nTob.

Mask removal and the hand-to-\nmouth action of smoking may also predispose smokers \nto viral exposure6. The World Health Organization \nhas recommended smoking cessation to reduce the \nburden of COVID-197.\nMessages regarding the risk of smoking on \nCOVID-19 susceptibility and severity may influence \nsmoking and quitting behaviors. Unverified claims \nthat smoking can protect against COVID-19 have \nbeen widely disseminated, especially during the \nearly phase of the pandemic8. Our population-based \nsurvey in Hong Kong found that exposure to such \nmisinformation was associated with increased tobacco \nuse9. On the other hand, observational studies in the \nUS and UK showed that a higher perceived risk of \nCOVID-19 related to smoking was associated with \nincreased cessation-related behaviors (e.g. smoking \nreduction, quit attempts, and intentions)10,11, also \nshown in our study in Hong Kong12. Several online \nexperiments have found that exposure to messaging \non smoking-related COVID-19 risk can increase \nsmokers’ motivations to quit13,14, which may be \nmediated by fear arousal15. Nevertheless, our PubMed \nsearch (until March 2023) using the keywords ‘risk \ncommunication’, ‘health communication’, ‘health \nwarning’, ‘messaging’, ‘COVID-19’, and ‘smoking’ \ndid not identify any randomized clinical trial (RCT) \ntesting the effectiveness of such messaging on \nsmoking abstinence in a real-world setting.\nOur previous trial showed the effectiveness of \ninstant mobile messaging in promoting smoking \ncessation16. Our subsequent trial showed the \nfeasibility of using instant mobile messaging to deliver \ncessation support amid the COVID-19 pandemic17, in \nwhich access to in-person cessation services might \nbe constrained. The current study compared the \neffectiveness of communicating smoking-related \nCOVID-19 risk using instant mobile messaging \nwith generic cessation support via text messaging to \nincrease abstinence in community smokers.\nMETHODS\nTrial design\nThis parallel, 2-arm, pragmatic RCT was conducted \nunder the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and \nHealth Quit-to-Win Contest16,18-21 in Hong Kong, \nChina. Recruitment took place amid the 3rd wave of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, with approximately 4200 \nconfirmed cases and 100 deaths in a population \nof approximately 7.5 million during the period \nof the recruitment (13 June to 30 October 2020, \nSupplementary file Figure S1)22. Stringent preventive \nmeasures were implemented, including mandatory \nmasking and the restriction of public gatherings to \ntwo people, but without a city-wide lockdown23. The \ncompliance rate of mask-wearing was nearly 100%. \nThe Institutional Review Board of the University of \nHong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West \nCluster approved the protocol. The trial has been \nregistered with ClinicalTrials.gov. The results are \nreported according to the Consolidated Standards of \nReporting Trials (CONSORT-EHEALTH) reporting \nguidelines.\nRecruitment and participants\nParticipants were recruited from smoking hotspots \nin all 18 districts of Hong Kong or using online \nplatforms. A total of 55 recruitment activities \n(booths in shopping malls and public areas) were \norganized at 47 community sites. University students \nand volunteers (n=110) from nongovernmental \norganizations attended a full-day online workshop \nand were trained as smoking cessation advisors. \nSimilar to previous trials16,18-21, trained smoking \ncessation advisors proactively approached, screened \nand recruited smokers at smoking hotspots using \nthe ‘foot-in-the-door’ approach24. Compared with \nthe pre-pandemic period, fewer smokers were \nobserved in outdoor smoking hotspots amid the \npandemic6. Therefore, online advertisements were \nalso used to recruit smokers, who were screened by \na cessation advisor through video calls (eMethods in \nSupplementary file).\nEligible participants were Hong Kong residents \nwho were aged ≥18 years, smoked at least 1 tobacco \nstick [cigarette or heated tobacco product (HTP)] per \nday or used e-cigarettes daily in the past 3 months, \nwhich was verified by a salivary cotinine level of \n≥30 ng/mL, who was fluent in Cantonese, owned a \nsmartphone with an instant messaging application \ninstalled, and had the intention to quit or reduce \nsmoking. The exclusion criteria were participating \nin other smoking cessation programs or having \nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2023;21(June):77\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/163176\n3\nphysical or cognitive difficulties in communication. \nAll eligible smokers willing to participate signed a \nwritten informed consent form.\nInterventions\nAll participants received brief cessation advice at \nbaseline guided by the AWARD (Ask, Warn, Advise, \nRefer and Do-it-again) model, which was modified \nfrom the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) \nmodel for use in the community settings, as in our \nprevious trials conducted under the Quit-to-Win \nContests16,18-21. Smoking cessation advisors asked the \nsmokers about their smoking history (Ask), warned \nthem about the hazards of smoking using a health \nwarning leaflet (Warn), advised them to quit or reduce \nsmoking as soon as possible (Advice), encouraged \nthem to use a cessation service (Refer), and repeated \nthe above steps if they continued to smoke or had \nrelapsed at telephone follow-up sessions (Do-it-\nagain).\nParticipants in the control group received a generic \nhealth warning leaflet that included shocking pictures \nof diseases caused by smoking, such as coronary heart \ndisease, stroke, and lung cancer (Supplementary file \nFigure S2). They also received regular text messages \n(i.e. participants not able to respond to the messages) \nwith generic cessation advice for three months from \nbaseline, with a tapering schedule from twice a week \nin the first month to once a week in the following two \nmonths (16 messages in total). The messages included \nadvice on smoking hazards and quitting benefits, \nstrategies for quitting and coping, psychosocial \nsupport, and encouragement to initiate a quit attempt.\nParticipants in the intervention group received \na health warning leaflet that highlighted the \nsmoking-related COVID-19 risk (Supplementary \nfile Figure S3). This included emphasizing the risk \nof respiratory infection, impaired immunity and \nCOVID-19 complications in smokers (1.4-fold to 2.4-\nfold increased risk of requiring intensive care, using \nventilators, and death)25, as well as the higher risk \nof viral exposure because of mask removal, hand-to-\nmouth action of smoking, clustering of smokers, and \nsecondhand smoke. They also received a combination \nof regular messages and chat-based cessation support \nfor three months via WhatsApp, an instant messaging \napplication. The schedule of regular messages was \nthe same as that in the control group (16 messages \nin total). The contents were similar to those of the \ncontrol group, except the messages on smoking \nhazards focused on smoking-related COVID-19 \nrisk. These messages were adopted from tweets and \nFacebook posts from the WHO, Centre for Health \nProtection of the Hong Kong Government, and the \nUniversity of Hong Kong (Supplementary file Figure \nS4). Similar to our previous trials on mobile instant \nmessaging support16,17,26, the participants could \nrespond to the messages and initiate conversations \nwith a research nurse to receive cessation coaching \nin real-time during office hours (9 a.m. to 6 p.m., \nMonday to Friday). Behavioral change techniques \n(e.g. eliciting and answering questions, providing \nfeedback on current behaviors, boosting motivation \nand self-efficacy)27 were used based on the needs \nof the participants. An experienced doctoral-level \nresearcher monitored the coaching process and \ndiscussed it with the research nurse when necessary.\nRandomization and blinding\nA computer-generated randomization list was \nproduced by an independent statistician using a \nrandomized blocking schema (2, 4, or 6). Participants \nwere individually assigned at random to groups with a \n1:1 allocation ratio. Blinding the interventionists and \nparticipants was not possible because of the nature \nof the intervention. Outcome assessors and statistical \nanalysts remained masked until the prespecified \nanalyses were completed.\nOutcomes\nData were collected by questionnaire at baseline and \ntelephone interviews at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after \nintervention initiation. The primary outcome was \nbiochemically verified 7-day PPA at three months (end \nof treatment) and six months after treatment initiation, \nverified by salivary cotinine concentrations of <30 \nng/mL or exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations \nof <4 ppm. Research staff visited or video-called \nparticipants who reported having abstained from \nsmoking for at least 7 days at 3 and 6 months for a \nbiochemical validation (eMethods in Supplementary \nfile)28. Secondary outcomes included self-reported \n7-day point-prevalence abstinence (PPA), smoking \nreduction defined by a reduction of at least 50% in \ndaily cigarette consumption compared with that at \nbaseline, and intervention engagement defined as \nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob.

We also \nassessed participants’ COVID-19-related information \nexposure (‘Have you ever received information on \nthe link between smoking and COVID-19?’, yes vs \nno). Process evaluations were conducted by assessing \nthe perceived appropriateness of the messages (yes vs \nno) and their usefulness in increasing the motivation \nto quit and quit attempt, each on a scale of 0 (not \nhelpful at all) to 4 (very useful). Participants in the \nintervention group were asked if they had engaged \nin online conversations with the research nurse and \nthe reasons for not doing so. Those who did engage \nin online conversations rated their satisfaction on a \nscale of 0 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (very satisfied).\nStatistical analysis\nA meta-analysis of mobile health interventions showed \nan effect size [risk ratio (RR)] of 1.83 on biochemically \nverified 7-day PPA at six months29. Based on our prior \nstudies12,19, we conservatively assumed an additional \n10% relative increase in the intervention effect due \nto messaging on smoking-related COVID-19 risk; the \nanticipated biochemically verified PPA was 10.1% in \nthe intervention group and 5.0% in the control group. \nWith a type I error of 0.05, a power of 80% and an \nallocation ratio of 1:1, 421 participants were needed \nper group. Accounting for a retention rate of 75%, a \ntotal of 1122 participants was needed.\nWe used intent-to-treat analyses, and participants \nwith missing outcomes were imputed as smokers \nwith no change in tobacco consumption. Poisson \nregression models with robust variance estimators \nwere used to calculate the RRs of the intervention \neffect on the primary and secondary outcomes. The \nassociations of baseline perceived susceptibility/\nseverity with 6-month biochemically verified PPA \nwere examined, adjusting for sociodemographic \nand known determinants of quitting30. Sensitivity \nanalyses were conducted for the abstinence outcomes. \nFirst, we used complete case analyses by excluding \nparticipants with missing outcomes. Second, we used \nmultiple imputation by chained equations to impute \nmissing abstinence outcomes, including study group, \nsex, age, education level, household income, previous \nquit attempts, cigarette dependence, and intention to \nquit. Rubin’s rule was used to pool the estimates from \n50 imputed datasets31. Mixed-effect models were used \nto examine the differences in changes in the perceived \nsusceptibility and severity of COVID-19 due to \nsmoking from baseline through 6 months. All analyses \nwere conducted using Stata V.15.1 (StataCorp, Texas, \nUSA), with p<0.05 indicating statistical significance.\nRESULTS \nParticipant characteristics\nFigure 1 shows that 1166 participants were \nrandomized to the intervention (n=583) or control \ngroup (n=583). The participants were mostly male \n(79.1%), aged 30–59 years (64.2%), married or \ncohabiting (51.4%), and had completed secondary \neducation (62.4%); 76.4% of the participants were \nrecruited in smoking hotspots and 23.6% via online \nplatforms. Participants smoked an average of 13.5 \ncigarettes per day, 71.5% had previous quit attempts, \nand 50.3% were ready to quit within the next 30 days. \nTable 1 shows that the baseline characteristics and \nsmoking profiles were similar between the groups. \nThe retention rates were 71–78% at the follow-up \nsessions and did not differ by group (p=0.21–84).\nSmoking cessation outcomes\nTable 2 shows that the primary outcome of \nbiochemically verified PPA was not significantly \ndifferent between the intervention and control groups \nat 3 months (9.6% vs 11.8%, RR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.58–\n1.13, p=0.22) or 6 months (9.3% vs 11.7%, RR=0.79; \n95% CI: 0.57–1.11, p=0.18). For secondary outcomes, \nself-reported 7-day PPA was significantly lower in \nthe intervention group than in the control group at \n3 months (14.8% vs 21.8%, RR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.53–\n0.87, p=0.002) but not at 6 months (15.6% vs 19.4%, \nRR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.63–1.04, p=0.09). Both groups \nreported similar smoking reduction rates. Sensitivity \nanalyses based on the complete case and multiple \nimputations showed similar results (Supplementary \nfile Table S1). Multivariable regression showed \nthat a higher perceived severity (RR=1.07; 95% CI: \nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc.

Exploratory \nanalyses using mixed-effect models showed no \nsignificant intervention effect on the changes \nFigure 1. Study flow diagram\nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc.

Biochemically verified 7-day PPA at 6 \nmonths was higher in engaged subgroups (e.g. read \nmessages, had conversations with research nurse, \nand read messages and had conversations) than non-\nengaged participants (Supplementary file Table S3). \nThe perceived appropriateness of the messages was \nhigh overall, although it was significantly lower in the \nintervention group than in the control group (86.5% \nvs 90.6%, p=0.04). Similarly, the perceived usefulness \nof the messages in increasing motivation to quit (2.3 vs \n2.4, p=0.02) and quit attempts (2.2 vs 2.4, p=0.02) was \nsignificantly lower in the intervention group.\nIn the intervention group, 49.4% (n=288) of the \nparticipants had conversations with the research \nnurse, with a mean satisfaction score of 8.5 (SD=1.9) \non a scale of 0 to 10. Being ‘too busy’ (49.5%) was \nthe most common reason for not conversing with \nthe research nurse, followed by ‘don't want to talk \nabout cessation-related topics online’ (32.9%), ‘not \ninterested’ (19.7%), and ‘not useful’ (5.4%). \nTable 1.

Contrary to our expectations, communicating \nsmoking-related COVID-19 risk via instant mobile \nmessaging did not increase biochemically verified \n7-day PPA at 3 and 6 months when compared with \ngeneric cessation support via text messaging amid the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. However, the 6-month verified \nPPA (approximately 10%) in both groups was much \nhigher than that of the intervention groups in our \nprevious RCTs conducted under the Quit-to-Win \ncontests before the COVID-19 pandemic (ranging \nfrom 5.6% to 9.0%)16,18-21. A 2019 Cochrane review of \n13 RCTs showed that text messaging-based behavioral \nsupport was effective in promoting abstinence29. Our \nfindings indicate that communicating messages on \nsmoking-related COVID-19 risk with a research \nnurse via instant messaging did not confer additional \nbenefits.\nThe intervention was designed to promote cessation \nby increasing the perceived smoking-related risk of \nCOVID-19, which has been found to be associated \nwith intermediate cessation outcomes such as the \nmotivation to quit in observational and experimental \nstudies10-14. Our secondary analyses also showed \nthat greater perceived severity of COVID-19 due \nto smoking was associated with 6-month verified \nPPA, adjusting for known determinants of successful \ncessation. However, we did not find a significant \ndifference in changes in perceptions between the \ntwo groups, which may explain the null effect on \nabstinence. Subgroup analyses between online \nand face-to-face recruitment found no significant \ndifference in abstinence, suggesting the similar null \neffects of interventions in both groups.\nSeveral reasons may underlie the failure of the \nintervention to change smoking-related COVID-19 \nrisk perception. Our survey conducted prior to the \ntrial showed that most smokers did not think smoking \nincreased COVID-19 susceptibility (72%) or severity \n(58%)12. However, our trial participants showed \nrelatively high levels of perceived susceptibility \nand severity (mean scores = 7.7 and 6.2 out of \n10, respectively) at baseline. This ‘ceiling effect’ \nmight have constrained the room for increasing \nthe risk perception level. Second, over 80% of the \nparticipants in both groups reported exposure to \ninformation on COVID-19 and smoking from any \nsources during the study period. The control group \nlikely was exposed to such information from other \nsources, such as publicity by the local health authority \nand cessation services. Such contamination might \nhave biased the intervention effect toward the null. \nFinally, participants’ ratings for the messages were \nsignificantly lower in the intervention group than in \nthe control group, which suggests that messaging on \nsmoking-related COVID-19 risk was less preferred \ncompared to generic messages and cessation support. \nTable 4.

Induc. Dis. 2023;21(June):77\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/163176\n9\nPrior qualitative studies on mobile messaging showed \nthat smokers might not be receptive to messages that \nrepeatedly emphasize the hazards of smoking (loss-\nframed messages)32,33. Further research is warranted \nto determine the optimal ‘dose’ to communicate \nsmoking-related COVID-19 risk without demotivating \nsmokers.\nStudies on smokers’ affective responses to messages \non smoking and COVID-19 also provide some insights \ninto our null findings. An experiment showed that \nmessages on smoking-related COVID-19 risk (vs \ntraditional risk) elicited similar levels of reactions \n(e.g. attention, negative affect) and were perceived \nto be similarly effective in discouraging smoking14. \nLikewise, another experiment showed no difference in \nvalence or arousal elicited by COVID-19 or traditional \ngraphic health warnings on cigarette packaging34. The \nexperiment also showed that smokers with lower delay \ndiscounting (i.e. the preference for smaller immediate \nrewards over larger but delayed rewards) were more \nlikely to be aroused by COVID-19 warnings34. The \nmuch milder impact of COVID-19 in Hong Kong \nthan in most other places worldwide might have led \nto a lower perceived benefit of cessation in reducing \nCOVID-19 risk and, thus, the abstinence rate.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe strengths of the study include the randomized \ntrial design conducted with a large cohort of smokers \n(n=1166) in a real-world setting with the use of an \nactive comparison group. Another strength is the use \nof biochemically verified PPA as the outcome with a \nsatisfactory participation rate (64%; 144/226) despite \nthe difficulties of conducting in-person validation \namid the pandemic.\nThis trial also had several limitations. First, despite \na satisfactory retention rate of 71% at 6 months, \ngiven the minimal contact between the participants \nand researchers, non-response bias could not be \nexcluded. However, our sensitivity analyses based \non multiple imputations and complete cases yielded \nsimilar results to those of the main analyses. Second, \nas discussed, most participants in the control group \nwere exposed to information on COVID-19-related \nsmoking risks, which might reduce the intervention \neffect size, if any. However, given the real-world trial \ndesign, such contamination is difficult to control35. \nThird, the secondary outcome of intervention \nengagement (i.e. having read the instant messages \nor text messages) was based on self-report. Finally, \nour trial was conducted in Hong Kong, where the \nprevalence of smoking is low (9.5%), and smokers \nare predominantly male36. The generalizability of the \nfindings to other places is unclear.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCommunicating smoking-related COVID-19 risk via \ninstant messaging was not more effective in increasing \nsmoking abstinence than generic cessation support \nvia text messaging.\nREFERENCES\n1.\t Hou H, Li Y, Zhang P, et al.

THE\n EDITOR\nCigarette\n smoking\n and\n COVID-19\nIn\n a  recent\n editorial\n published\n on\n tobacco\n and\n COVID-19,\nthe\n Sociedade\n Portuguesa\n de\n Pneumologia\n raises\n doubts\n and\ncaution\n about\n the\n data\n coming\n from\n the\n medical\n and\n sci-\nentiﬁc\n community\n regarding\n the\n hypothesis\n that\n cigarette\nsmoking\n or\n nicotine\n could\n be\n ‘‘protective’’\n against\n COVID-\n19,\n recommending\n that\n this\n information\n should\n not\n be\n taken\nas\n an\n invitation\n to\n start\n smoking\n or\n to\n delay\n giving\n it\n up\n to\navoid\n SARS-CoV-2\n infection\n or\n its\n complications.1\nThe\n role\n of\n cigarette\n smoking/nicotine\n (or\n whatever\nelse\n is\n contained\n within\n cigarette\n smoke)\n in\n the\n scientiﬁc\ndiscussion\n on\n COVID-19\n ignores\n the\n fact\n that\n smoke\n cessa-\ntion\n has\n to\n be\n discouraged\n to\n avoid\n COVID-19\n pulmonary\ncomplications\n (this\n seems\n obvious\n for\n scientists\n and\n physi-\ncians)\n but\n references\n the\n scientiﬁc\n importance\n of\n the\n strong\nepidemiological\n data\n coming\n from\n all\n the\n countries\n that\n hos-\npitalized\n patients\n with\n SARS-CoV-2\n related\n pneumonia\n show\nquite\n low\n percentages\n of\n active\n smokers.2,3\nBased\n on\n this\n we\n have\n to\n strongly\n support\n the\n importance\nof\n understanding\n of\n the\n possible\n mechanisms\n character-\nizing\n these\n aspects,\n i.e.\n how\n cigarette\n smoking\n dampens\nthe\n inﬂammatory\n response\n during\n infection\n by\n SARS-CoV-2\nstrongly\n reducing\n the\n severe\n complications\n of\n SARS-CoV-\n2\n infection,\n mainly\n nterstitial\n pneumonia\n and\n ARDS.\n The\nreported\n evidence\n that\n among\n COVID-19\n patients,\n those\n who\nare\n (and/or\n were)\n smokers\n show\n worse\n clinical\n progression\nwith\n respect\n to\n never\n smokers\n is  not\n in\n contradiction\n with\nthe\n huge\n number\n of\n studies\n showing\n that\n there\n are\n few\nactive\n smokers\n among\n hospitalized\n patients\n with\n SARS-CoV-\n2\n related\n pneumonia.4---6 However\n it\n is  quite\n strange\n that\n a\nscientiﬁc\n society\n does\n not\n seem\n to\n understand\n the\n important\nscientiﬁc\n implications\n of\n such\n observations,\n bearing\n in\n mind\nthat\n of\n course\n cigarette\n smoking\n has\n to\n be\n discouraged\n due\nto\n its\n well\n known\n dangerous\n effects.\nThus\n we\n have\n to\n consider,\n without\n any\n preconceived\n posi-\ntion,\n on\n the\n one\n hand\n the\n notorious\n unhealthy\n effects\n of\ncigarette\n smoking,\n and\n on\n the\n other\n the\n possible\n impor-\ntant\n scientiﬁc\n information\n coming\n from\n different\n countries\nin\n the\n world\n showing\n that\n active\n smokers\n are\n somehow\n‘protected’\n from\n the\n severe\n complications\n of\n SARS-CoV-2\ninfection,\n namely\n interstitial\n pneumonia\n and\n ARDS.\nIn\n this\n context\n a\n very\n recent\n paper\n reported\n decreased\nlevels\n of\n the\n SARS-CoV-2\n receptor\n ACE2\n in\n both\n bronchial\nand\n alveolar\n epithelial\n cells\n from\n cigarette\n smoking-exposed\nversus\n air-exposed\n mice.7 Furthermore\n and\n more\n impor-\ntantly,\n cigarette\n smoking\n treatment\n did\n not\n affect\n ACE2\nlevels\n but\n potently\n inhibited\n SARS-CoV-2\n replication\n in\n Calu3\ncells\n in\n vitro.7 On\n the\n other\n hand\n previous\n studies\n have\nreported\n the\n opposite\n effects\n of\n cigarette\n smoking\n on\n ACE2\nexpression\n in\n the\n lung,8 thus\n underlying\n the\n urge\n for\n fur-\nther\n investigations\n to\n ﬁnally\n clarify\n the\n role\n of\n cigarette\nsmoking\n on\n SARS-CoV-2\n infection\n and\n its\n severe\n respiratory\ncomplications.\nScience\n proceeds\n by\n criticism\n and\n by\n analyzing\n objective\ndata\n coming\n from\n scientists.\n In\n 1939\n Winston\n Churchill\n said\n‘‘Criticism\n may\n not\n be\n agreeable,\n but\n it\n is\n necessary.\n It  fulﬁls\nthe\n same\n function\n as\n pain\n in  the\n human\n body;\n it  calls\n atten-\ntion\n to\n the\n development\n of\n an\n unhealthy\n state\n of\n things.\n If  it\nis\n heeded\n in  time,\n danger\n may\n be\n averted;\n if\n it\n is  suppressed,\na\n fatal\n distemper\n may\n develop’’.9\nIn\n the\n case\n of\n active\n smoking\n and\n COVID-19,\n to\n hide\n ones\nhead\n in\n the\n sand\n will\n not\n help\n rapid\n scientiﬁc\n progress\n in\n the\ndiscovery\n of\n the\n pathophysiology\n

Sociedade\n Portuguesa\n de\n Pneu-\nmologia’’\n published\n in\n Pulmonology\n in\n December\n 2020.2 We\nwould\n like\n to\n thank\n the\n authors\n for\n the\n challenging\n discussion\npoints\n and\n we\n acknowledge\n that,\n as\n in  all\n ﬁelds\n of\n science,\nnew\n data\n are\n continuously\n being\n collected\n and\n interpreted\nand\n we\n are\n still\n far\n from\n deﬁnitive\n conclusions\n about\n how\nsmoking\n really\n impacts\n COVID-19.\nThe\n observations\n that\n report\n a  low\n rate\n of\n smokers\n among\nCOVID-19\n patients\n are\n pertinent\n but\n have\n yet\n to\n be\n con-\nﬁrmed\n by\n good\n quality\n epidemiological\n studies\n designed\n to\naddress\n this\n question.\n As\n we\n mentioned,\n a\n high\n number\n of\nstudies\n does\n not\n report\n smoking\n status\n or\n does\n not\n distin-\nguish\n never-smokers\n from\n missing\n data\n and\n this\n may\n pose\nconsiderable\n bias.2 At\n the\n present\n time,\n we\n cannot\n rule\n out\nthe\n hypothesis\n that\n smoking\n may\n not\n constitute\n a  strong\nrisk\n factor\n for\n COVID-19,\n but\n we\n have\n to\n further\n specify\nwhat\n questions\n we\n are\n posing:\n what\n is\n the\n difference\n in\nrisk\n between\n present\n smokers\n and\n having\n a  past\n history?\nAre\n smokers\n more\n prone\n to\n contract\n SARS-Cov-2\n infection\nin\n general?\n We\n do\n not\n have\n enough\n information\n concerning\nasymptomatic\n infection\n and\n smoking,\n and\n we\n know\n there\nmay\n be\n a  bias\n toward\n higher\n testing\n rates\n in\n smokers,3 due\nto\n higher\n rates\n of\n respiratory\n symptoms.\n An\n interesting\n study\nin\n Nature4 shows\n that\n there\n are\n difﬁculties\n in\n correctly\nadjusting\n for\n other\n covariates\n ----\n depending\n on\n the\n covari-\nates\n included,\n a  smoking\n history\n could\n either\n be\n associated\nwith\n a  higher\n risk\n of\n COVID-19\n (age\n and\n sex\n adjusted\n only)\nor\n lower\n risk\n (fully\n adjusted\n model).\n After\n adjusting\n only\n for\ndemographic\n factors\n (age,\n sex,\n deprivation\n and\n ethnicity),\nthe\n authors\n found\n a  non-signiﬁcant\n positive\n hazard\n ratio\n for\ncurrent\n smoking\n (HR\n 1.07\n (0.98---1.18)),\n excluding\n any\n pro-\ntective\n effect\n of\n nicotine\n and\n suggesting\n that\n any\n increased\nrisk\n with\n current\n smoking\n is\n likely\n to\n be\n small.\nRossato\n and\n Di\n Vincenzo\n also\n quote\n the\n new\n paper\n by\n Tom-\nchaney\n et\n al.,5 reporting\n conﬂicting\n new\n results\n that\n show\ndecreased\n expression\n of\n ACE2\n receptors\n in  both\n bronchial\nand\n alveolar\n epithelial\n cells\n exposed\n to\n cigarette\n smoke.\nThese\n are\n puzzling\n data\n that\n still\n wait\n peer-review\n and\n pub-\nlication.\n Animal\n studies\n are\n undoubtedly\n important\n to\n open\nnew\n pathophysiologic\n hypothesis;\n however,\n we\n still\n face\nuncertainties\n as\n to\n the\n real\n role\n of\n ACE-2\n receptor\n modula-\ntion\n and\n the\n risk\n of\n infection.\n One\n of  the\n problems\n concerns\ntobacco\n smoke,\n a  mixture\n of  thousands\n of\n chemicals\n inter-\nacting\n together,\n and\n the\n presumptive\n role\n of\n nicotine.\n The\nstudies\n by  Russo\n et\n al.6 have\n thrown\n some\n light\n on\n how\nisolated\n nicotine\n may\n facilitate\n SARS-Cov-2\n infection:\n nico-\ntine,\n even\n at\n low\n concentrations,\n increases\n ACE-2\n levels\n in\nbronchial\n cells.\n Besides,\n they\n showed\n that\n ACE-2\n increase\nis\n speciﬁcally\n mediated\n by\n \u00027-nAChR,\n suggesting\n that\n smok-\ning\n may\n promote\n cellular\n uptake\n mechanisms\n of\n SARS-CoV-2\nthrough\n \u00027-nAChR\n signaling.\n The\n presence\n of\n this\n receptor\nin\n neuronal\n tissues\n also\n raises\n questions\n about\n the\n impact\nof\n smoking\n in\n COVID-19\n pathophysiology\n in\n several\n organs,\nincluding\n the\n brain.\nIn\n the\n absence\n of\n well-designed\n studies,\n with\n large\n popu-\nlations,\n any\n hypothesis\n on\n the\n effect\n of\n smoking\n or\n nicotine\nin\n the\n risk\n of\n COVID-19\n remains\n unproven.\n More\n than\n ﬁve\ndecades\n of\n research\n in\n vast\n population-based\n studies\n were\nneeded\n to\n establish\n the\n causative\n effect\n of\n tobacco\n in\n sev-\neral\n deadly\n diseases.\n Our\n minds\n should\n be\n open\n to\n change,\nbut\n in\n the\n present\n state\n of\n knowledge,\n we\n stand\n with\n the\nWHO\n and\n adopt\n a  cautious\n recommendation\n

Psychologically, this era is considered as a “transition” \nphase and seems to require a search for a new balance. While \nboredom and confinement might have stimulated smoking \namong some, the threat of contracting COVID-19 and becom-\ning severely ill might have motivated others to improve their \nhealth by quitting smoking; this is particularly true for indi-\nviduals with moderate to severe stress.1\nStudies have reported mixed findings regarding changes in \ntobacco use during the pandemic. Indeed, in the United States, \nfar more participants reported increasing their tobacco use \nsince COVID-19 started (40.9%) versus decreasing their \ntobacco use (17.8%).2 In Italy, most exclusive cigarette smokers \nhave considered quitting, but most exclusive e-cigarette users \nhave not considered stopping the use of e-cigarettes. In the \ngroup of former smokers, about one-third of participants \nreported having thoughts about smoking again, and in the \ngroup of never smokers, few participants declared the intention \nto start smoking.3 In China, relapses from smoking abstinence \nwere relatively common during the pandemic (25%). Similarly, \n20% of regular smokers increased their usage amount.4 In \nEngland, a study have found that increased smoking among \nsmokers and relapsed smoking among former smokers were a \nresult of social isolation and potential stress.5 A study done by \nChertok6 among 810 adults from Ohio have found a change in \nsmoking behavior among current smokers since COVID-19 \nwere 36.7% having attempted to quit since the outbreak.\nDebates are still ongoing as to the effect of cigarette smok-\ning on vulnerability to COVID-19. Although it is well estab-\nlished that smoking is associated with morbidity and mortality \nin several respiratory infections, some studies, where active \nsmokers were underrepresented among patients with COVID-\n19, claimed that a “smoker’s paradox” may exist in COVID-19 \nand that smokers are protected from infection and severe \nSmoking and COVID-19: A Scoping Review\nChadia Haddad1,2*\n, Sandrella Bou Malhab3*, Hala Sacre4\n  \nand Pascale Salameh4,5,6 \n1Research Department, Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross, Jal Eddib, Lebanon. 2INSERM, Univ. \nLimoges, CH Esquirol, IRD, U1094 Tropical Neuroepidemiology, Institute of Epidemiology and \nTropical Neurology, GEIST, Limoges, France. 3Ecole Doctorale des Sciences et Technologie, \nLebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon. 4INSPECT-LB: Institut National de Santé Publique, \nÉpidémiologie Clinique et Toxicologie-Liban, Beirut, Lebanon. 5Faculty of Pharmacy, \nLebanese University, Hadat, Lebanon. 6School of Medicine, University of Nicosia, Cyprus.\nABSTRACT: Smoking affects a person’s overall health and damages nearly every organ of the body. Since smoking tobacco affects and dam-\nages the lungs, it increases the risk of respiratory infections and makes it easier for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to invade the lung \ntissue, causing more severe symptoms and increasing the risk of death. However, debates are still ongoing as to the effect of cigarette smok-\ning on vulnerability to COVID-19. Some studies, where active smokers were underrepresented among patients with COVID-19, claimed that a \n“smoker’s paradox” may exist in COVID-19 and that smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. However, \nother studies reported the opposite trend. The objective of this study is to review the findings of epidemiological and in vitro studies about the \nassociation between smoking and the risk of contracting COVID-19, taking into account disease severity. Several epidemiological studies have \nfound a higher smoking prevalence among COVID-19 infected patients. Also, studies had shown that people with respiratory diseases caused \nby tobacco use are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. Studies have shown that in vitro, the acute exposure allows for \nmore severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and the proliferation of \nairway basal stem cells and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke, with a more severe viral \ninfection and cell death. Smoker patients with different comorbidities are at higher risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus and have a worse \nprognosis for the virus as well as for their comorbidities. Further investigations of the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted \nto accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and the progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients who \nsuffer from it.\nKeywords: Smoking, tobacco waterpipe, coronavirus disease, epidemiologic studies, cigarette smoking\nRECEIVED: September 9, 2020.

However, other studies reported \nthe opposite trend. Therefore, the need of a scoping review to \nprovide an overview of the available research evidence. The \nobjective of this study is to review the findings of epidemio-\nlogical and in vitro studies about the association between \nsmoking and the risk of contracting COVID-19, taking into \naccount disease severity.\nMethod and research design\nA comprehensive literature review was conducted using the \nMEDLINE/PubMed database and references cited in relevant \narticles were also searched. Included studies were recently pub-\nlished about the effect of COVID-19 on smoking from January \n1st, up till the end of September, 2020. Also, studies about the \nmechanisms by which smoking affects the body were included \nfrom December 2001 up till May 2018. No restrictions were \nplaced on language of publication or study origin. Limitations \nwere placed on the type of publication when using the PubMed \ndatabase and included all of the following: case reports, clinical \nstudies, clinical trials, comparative studies, controlled clinical tri-\nals, journal articles, meta-analyses, observational studies, system-\natic reviews, and books and documents. Whenever possible, \npeer-reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and placebo \ncontrolled trials were preferred over case reports, case studies and \ncommentaries, while review articles and meta-analyses were also \nincluded whenever relevant. Similarly, books and book chapters \non the topic of smoking were also reviewed for eligibility.\nTo ensure retrieval of the largest number of articles cover-\ning the topic of smoking, the following key search terms were \nused: “smoking,” “tobacco,” “nicotine,” “covid-19,” “coronavirus \ndisease,” “hookah” and “waterpipe,” “cigarette,” “smoker,” “epi-\ndemic,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “virus,” and “respiratory function”. \nThe search term “smoking” was included in the initial run of \nthe online databases but resulted in over 315 133 articles, the \nmajority of which were irrelevant. Consequently “smoking” as \na search term was eliminated from the primary searches \nconducted.\nThen we used the term “Smoking and covid-19” and \n“effect of smoking on the body” and we obtained a total of \n20 188 articles using the MEDLINE/PubMED database. \nOf the 20 188 article, 557 articles were about ‘smoking and \nCOVID-19” and 19 631 were about “harmful effect of \nsmoking.” Title and abstract screening resulted in the elimi-\nnation of articles that were not relevant or did not cover the \ntopic of smoking; did not meet the initial inclusion criteria \nrelated to article type; focused primarily on other disease \nand disorders other than smoking; or primarily focused on \npsycho-social aspects and risk factors related to smoking. \nThis resulted in 200 articles that required in-depth analysis, \nof which 50 were eliminated due to irrelevance, and 48 were \nnot found to be focused on smoking and COVID-19. This \nresulted in 107 articles which were included in the final ver-\nsion of the article.\nModes of COVID-19 Transmission Using a Tobacco \nSmoking\nViral transmission through tobacco smoking might first occur \nthrough contact since smoking involves regular contact between \nsaliva, hands, and devices.7 Moreover, smoking tobacco (ciga-\nrettes, e-cigarettes, or waterpipe) produces exhaled smoke and \naerosols, and causes coughing or sneezing, thus contaminating \nsurroundings and surfaces with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).\nAdditionally, SARS-CoV-2 survives in aerosols and sur-\nfaces (plastic, paper, and steel) for several hours to days8 after \noral/nasal release (coughing, sneezing, smoking).9,10 Also, the \nvirus is actively found for 4 hours up to 2 to 3 days on shared \nsurfaces of smoking devices.7 Thus, touching contaminated \nsurfaces of smoking devices can actively harm smokers and \nnon-smokers, even when people practice social distancing.7\nThe act of cigarette smoking and virus transmission\nThe COVID-19 is transmitted from hand to mouth as smok-\ning cigarettes implies that fingers and contaminated cigarettes \nare in contact with the lips or comes close to the mouth, which \nincreases the risk of transmission.11,12 The latter also depends \non whether hands are contaminated and how the packet is pre-\npared and handled.12 Indeed, infected hands can contaminate a \nclean packet and the cigarettes it contains, thus it is no longer \nclean during the remaining time of its use.12\nThe act of waterpipe smoking and virus \ntransmission\nWaterpipe smoking is the process of inhaling tobacco smoke \nafter it has passed through a chilled water chamber, with a hose \ncapped with a plastic mouthpiece.13 Virus transmission through \nthe waterpipe is high since smokers might cough and contami-\nnate the inner side of the hose. The moisture in tobacco smoke \nand the use of cold water in the water chamber promote the \nsurvival of viruses and bacteria.13,14 Also, uncontrolled manual \npreparation of waterpipe could spread infectious diseases.14 \nAnother factor of contamination is that most cafés prefer not \nto clean the waterpipe upon each smoking session, since it is \nlabor-intensive and time-consuming to wash and clean pieces, \nincluding the cold water jar, ideal for virus transmission.13,15 \nMoreover, the waterpipe tobacco smoke contains many dan-\ngerous chemicals that damage the respiratory tract and predis-\npose the smoker to viral infection.15\nOn the other hand, smoking waterpipe is an activity typi-\ncally performed within groups in public settings.16 Social gath-\nerings encourage the transmission of the COVID -19 virus.17 \nThe risk may be higher when waterpipe is used indoors.18 \nParticipants usually pass the hose from person to person and \nmay use the same mouthpiece16 during smoking sessions that \nlast from 45 to 60 minutes but can also be up to several hours.14 \nEven if only 1 customer uses the pipe and mouthpiece at a \nHaddad et al\t\n3\ntime, other customers might reuse uncleaned waterpipes cham-\nbers and hoses on the same day.14\nIt is noteworthy to mention that until now no studies have \ndirectly examine the mode of transmission of COVID-19 \nthrough cigarette or waterpipe use. The abovementioned stud-\nies are most often prospective envisioning or predicting the \nCOVID-19 transmission based on facts about waterpipe and \ncigarette use. Further studies and evidence are needed in order \nto understand the transmission way of COVID-19 through \nsmoking and measures should be implemented within the \ncommunity to limit its direct and indirect effects.7\nMechanisms Through Which Smoking may Increase \nthe Risk of Infection with COVID-19\nMechanistic studies indicate that the enhanced susceptibility \nto infection could be attributed to angiotensin converting \nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor upregulation, the key receptor \nused to gain entrance into the host mucosa and induce active \ninfection by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n(SARS-CoV-2), an apparently unique mechanism for this \nvirus. Smoking contributes to a worse disease state and \nincreased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection via the \nactivation of peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \n(nAChRs) expressed in many organ systems. Nicotine affects \nhomeostasis of the renin angiotensin system (RAS)19 and \ncontributes to the up-regulation of the angiotensin-convert-\ning enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin (ANG)-II/ANG II type 1 \nreceptor axis, leading to the development of cardiovascular \nand pulmonary diseases.19\nIn parallel, coronaviruses have distinctive crown-shaped \nfeatures due to the presence of large type 1 transmembrane \nspike (S1 and S2) glycoproteins mediating entry of the virus \ninto the host cell. The S1 domain is responsible for first stage \nhost cell entry and contains the angiotensin-converting \nenzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Recent evidence suggests that the \nSARS-CoV-2 modified S protein exhibited a significantly \nhigher affinity for ACE2 and is 10- to 20-fold more likely to \nbind to ACE2 in human cells, enabling an easy person-to-per-\nson spread of the virus.20 So the action of nicotine on nAChRs \nfacilitates the SARS-CoV-2 host entry.21\nSmoking and the respiratory function\nThe lung RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of different lung \ndiseases other than blood pressure and fluid balance, like pulmo-\nnary arterial hypertension (PAH)22 lung infection/inflamma-\ntion,23 acute respiratory distress syndrome,24 Chronic Obstructive \nPulmonary Disease (COPD),25 and pulmonary fibrosis.26\nBronchial epithelial cells absorb inhaled nicotine and smoke \ncomponents. The gas mixture generated by smoking contains \nhundreds of components including carbon monoxide, nicotine, \noxidants, fine particulate matters (PM), and aldehydes associ-\nated with the onset of COPD.27 Inhaled smoke is responsible \nfor the destruction of the matrix, shortage of blood supply, and \ndeath of epithelial cells. It leads to the infiltration of inflamma-\ntory cells to mucosa and glandular tissue.27\nFurthermore, acrolein, a smoke component, impairs the \nalveolar-capillary barrier function, resulting in lung inflamma-\ntion and increased susceptibility to acute respiratory distress \ndisorder (ARDS).28\nChronic smoking significantly decreases pulmonary func-\ntion, that is, Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1), Forced Vital \nCapacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF), and Fractional \nExhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO).29 The latter is associated with \ndecreased NO and its conversion to peroxynitrite (ONOO) \ndue to oxidative stress.30\nSmoking and the immune system\nSmoking is a cause of the release of many inflammatory media-\ntors (pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines).31 \nMany studies have demonstrated the association of smoking \nwith chronic systemic inflammation and autoimmune diseases \n(rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, COPD, and systemic lupus \nerythematosus).32\nNicotine interacts with nAChRs α7 on the surface of \nimmune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes T and B,33 \nand induces an immunosuppressive effect, modulating innate \nand adaptive immune responses.34,35 Therefore, smoking alters \nthe development and function of innate (dendritic cells, mac-\nrophages, and natural killer cells) and adaptive immune cells \n(cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T helper cells (Th), regula-\ntory T cells, and B cells), leading to pro-inflammatory responses, \nthus worsening smoking-associated COPD.32\nSmoking and oxidative stress\nOxidative stress is the result of an imbalance between the pro-\nduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant \ncapacity of the organism. ROS are essential for some signaling \npathways, but their excess leads to proteins, lipids, and DNA \noxidation, which is involved in some diseases.36 Tobacco smoke \nconstituents induce oxidative stress via different mechanisms, \nincluding the direct effects of nicotine (neutralized by N-acetyl-\ncysteine) and the abundance of PM.37 Oxidative stress and \ninflammation lead to the increased production of superoxide \nanion (O2•−) via the NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide synthase \n(iNOS) as principal sources of ROS.38 Furthermore, carbon \nmonoxide released by smoking is directly absorbed in the lungs. \nIt forms a tight but reversible bond with hemoglobin and leads \nto tissue hypoxia. But once eliminated, oxygen reperfusion \noccurs, thus increasing ROS.39\nWaterpipe is also a source of heavy metals such as Pb, Cr \nand arsenic that lead to free radicals formation.40 Acrolein, a \ntoxic unsaturated aldehyde produced by cigarette and water-\npipe, binds to proteins and DNA, and induce oxidative stress \nand inflammation. Acrolein decreases antioxidant enzyme pro-\nmoting ROS production, oxidizes lipids and produces more \n4\t\nTobacco Use Insights ﻿\nacrolein in a vicious circle.41 Acute and high dose exposures to \nacrolein suppresses immune response while in the case for \nrepetitive waterpipe smoking, (chronic exposure with low \ndoses) enhances inflammatory response.42\nSmoking and the cardiovascular function\nChronic exposure to nicotine (through the activation of \nnAChRs, widely expressed in the heart)43 exacerbates patho-\nlogical changes in the heart. Cigarette smoke accelerates the \nprogression of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.44 Previous \nfindings demonstrated a possible cardiotoxic interaction \nbetween nicotine and the RAS.45 Nicotine was shown to exac-\nerbate cardiovascular remodeling induced by ANG II, which \nincluded increased heart rate, and increased thickening of the \naortic wall.45 Both nicotine and RAS are involved in the patho-\ngenesis of vascular calcification and abdominal aortic aneu-\nrysms (AAA).41 Thus, smoking is a considerable risk factor \nassociated with the development, expansion, and rupture of \nAAA.46\nSmoking and the endocrine system\nThe activation of nAChRs affects many organ systems, includ-\ning the endocrine system. Prolactin levels are directly related to \ndopamine secretion, while the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \n(HPA) axis stimulation is associated with the stress level con-\ntrolled by nicotine administration.47 Furthermore, smoking \nworsens insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus (DM) via \nmany proposed mechanisms, including but not limited to the \nactivation by the nicotine of a macrophage α7-nAChR associ-\nated anti-inflammatory pathway and the exacerbation of nico-\ntine-associated inflammation and insulin resistance.48 Another \nmechanism may be the increased ROS due to the increased \nexpression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),49 in addition \nto maternal smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding, \ncausing insulin resistance later in childhood.50\nA Known Fact: Harmful Effects of Smoking\nIn addition to the increased risk of virus transmission, smoking \naffects a person’s overall health and damages nearly every organ \nof the body.51,52 When tobacco toxins enter the body through \nthe mouth and nose, they cause tissue and cells damage up to \nthe lungs,53 including upper lung airways and alveoli, resulting \nin lung inflammation and reduced lung and immune func-\ntion.53 Consequently, cigarette smoking causes lung diseases \nsuch as bronchiolitis, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphy-\nsema, tuberculosis, and lung cancers, in addition to an increased \nrisk of respiratory infections.53 While the lung has initial ways \nto protect itself from damage caused by inhalation agents, these \ndefenses are gradually overwhelmed as tobacco smoke is \nrepeatedly inhaled over time.53 After years of smoking, the lung \ntissue becomes severely damaged, loses its elasticity, and can no \nlonger easily exchange air.53 Similar to cigarettes, waterpipe \nsmoke harms pulmonary cells and damages alveoli, causing tis-\nsue inflammation and undermining the capacity of the lungs to \nfight off infection.54 Indeed, after a single session, cell damage \nand lung inflammation have been detected among waterpipe \nusers.54 Thus, smoking reduces the ability of the lung to absorb \noxygen and release carbon dioxide, storing up mucus, which \nleads to excessive coughing and difficulties in breathing.53\nSince smoking tobacco affects and damages the lungs, it \nmakes it easier for the SARS-CoV-2 to invade the lung tissue, \ncausing more severe symptoms and increasing the risk of \ndeath.18 Smoking also requires high respiratory volumes, deep \ninhalation, progressive cooling and drying of the mucous res-\npiratory tract, and changes in nose-to-mouth breathing. It \nreduces the mobility of ciliated cells and raises the viscosity of \nthe mucous membrane, which impairs the filtration of micro-\norganisms from the upper respiratory tract system.53\nSmoking and COVID-19: Current Clinical Findings\nBased on these mechanisms, smoking is hypothesized to \nincrease risks associated with COVID-19. Several epidemio-\nlogical and clinical studies conducted to confirm this hypoth-\nesis found conflicting results.\nLower prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 \ninfected patients\nA spatial analysis involving 175 countries showed that the per-\ncentage of the total smoking population was inversely associ-\nated with COVID-19 at the global level.55 In Mexico, among \n89 756 laboratory-confirmed positive cases (retrospective case \nseries used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on \nMay 31, 2020, by the Mexican Ministry of Health), current \nsmokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 \ncompared to non-smokers. However, having COPD (among \nother comorbidities) was associated with hospitalization and \nadverse outcomes. Current smoking was not linked to unfa-\nvorable outcomes.56 Similarly, an ecological study found a sta-\ntistically significant negative association between smoking \nprevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 \nEuropean nations, after controlling for confounding factors. \nHowever, it could not demonstrate a direct association between \nsmoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality (P = .626).57 A \npreliminary study that analyzed the data available in published \narticles showed a lower prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 \npatients compared to the regional average.58\nIt is noteworthy that statistical associations do not imply \ncausation: they might be explained by several facts, such as an \ninterfering dose-effect relationship (whenever the number of \npacks, the duration, and the timing of smoking, are not meas-\nured), reverse causation (some people had stopped smoking \nduring the pandemic), or a residual confounding (additional \nconfounding factors not taken into account). Likely, the low \nprevalence of smokers among COVID-19 hospitalized patients \nis partly due to the fact that many smokers were misclassified \nHaddad et al\t\n5\nas nonsmokers.59 Researchers have also identified information \nand selection biases, in addition to knowledge gaps, which may \ngive the false impression that smoking is protective against \nCOVID-19.60\nPlausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be \nprotective against COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory \neffect of nicotine, a blunted immune response among smokers \n(reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19), and \nincreased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may \ninhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells),60 \nin addition to the possible role of squamous cell metaplasia, \nwhich is commonly associated with smoking.61 As of now, \nhowever, the data supporting the smoker's paradox claims are \nlimited and questionable The claims of a protective effect must \nbe viewed with extreme caution by both the general population \nand clinicians.60\nHigher prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 \ninfected patients\nSeveral epidemiological studies have found a higher smoking \nprevalence among COVID-19 infected patients. In a system-\natic review including thirteen studies the prevalence of current \nsmoking among 5960 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in \nChina ranged from 1.4% to 12.6%.61 The random effects \npooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.5% (95% confi-\ndence interval [CI]: 4.9%-8.2%).61 Another, meta-analysis \ndone by Emami et al.62 analyzed data for 2986 patients and \nfound a pooled prevalence of smoking of 7.6% (CI: 3.8%-\n12.4%). In a cross sectional study done among 53 002 adults \nfrom United Kingdom found that the prevalence of confirmed \nCOVID-19 was higher among current smokers (0.56% [CI: \n0.41%-0.75%]) as compared with never smokers.63 Data from \na hospital in France also indicate that while prevalence of cur-\nrent smoking was lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients \nthan the general population, prevalence of former smoking was \nmuch higher.64 In a cross-sectional study among adolescents \nand young adults, COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 times more \nlikely among ever-users of e-cigarettes only (95% CI: 1.82-\n13.96), 7 times more likely among ever-dual-users (95% CI: \n1.98-24.55), and 6.8 times more likely among past 30-day \ndual-users (95% CI: 2.40-19.55). Symptoms were also 4.7 \ntimes more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: \n3.07-7.16).65 Furthermore, a systematic review of reviews also \nshowed a significant association between COVID-19 infection \nand current or ever smoking.66\nAt this time, it is impossible to estimate the prevalence of \nsmoking status among COVID-19 patients in a population-\nrepresentative sample.61 The accuracy and consistency of the \nreported smoking status is also unknown. Given the emergency \nof the outbreak, the patient's smoking status could not have \nbeen properly reported or certain patients have been unable to \nregister their smoking status.61 It is also possible that some \npatients may also have been in critical condition at the time \nthey were hospitalized, affecting their communication capacity \nand their capacity to disclose their smoking status.61\nSmoking and COVID-19 progression, severity, and \nmortality\nNumerous studies had shown that people with respiratory dis-\neases caused by tobacco use are at higher risk of developing \nsevere COVID-19 symptoms.67-69 A study among 1099 \nChinese COVID-19 patients found that 32% of patients with \na history of smoking (smokers and ex-smokers) had a severe \nform of COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of hospitalization, \ncompared with 15% of patients who had never smoked.67 \nAnother study among 78 patients with COVID-19-induced \npneumonia found that 27% of smokers worsened within \n2 weeks of hospitalization, compared to 3% of non-smokers.68 \nA meta-analysis based on 15 studies showed that 22% of cur-\nrent smokers and 46% of ex-smokers had severe complications \nof the COVID-19.69\nDuring a follow up of 28 days among 720 patients, 71.50% \nhad recovered or were symptomatically stable, COPD was a \nrisk factor of progression, while smoking was inversely related \nto it.70 A meta-analysis found that smoking is a risk factor for \nCOVID-19 progression, with smokers having higher odds of \nCOVID-19 progression than never smokers (OR = 1.91).71 In \nKuwait, among 1096 consecutive COVID-19 patients, the risk \nfactors found to be significantly associated with admission to \nintensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score \nabove 0, smoking, elevated CRP, and elevated procalcitonin \nlevels. Smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels also corre-\nlated significantly with mortality.72 In a study to characterize a \nlarge cohort of patients with COVID-19 (n = 4536) and their \noutcomes, several factors were involved with increased hospi-\ntalization risk, including former smoking history, shortness of \nbreath, and certain medications (NSAIDs, immunosuppressive \ntreatment).73 A Brazilian study on 10 713 COVID-19 patients \nfound that both smoking and pulmonary disease increased the \nrisk of hospitalization.74 Other smaller studies showed similar \nresults.75 Among patients with lung cancer, determinants of \nCOVID-19 severity got largely patient-specific features, \nincluding smoking status and COPD (odds ratio for severe \nCOVID-19 = 2.9).76 Moreover, there is a possible role of smok-\ning and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunc-\ntion in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic \nmechanisms associated with it.77\nWhen assessing clinical characteristics and risk factors for \nmortality of patients with COVID-19 from Mexico, smoking \nwas found to increase the risk of death. Less frequent comor-\nbidities, such as COPD, chronic kidney disease, and immuno-\nsuppression, also showed a significant risk for death \n(P < .0001).78 Common independent factors associated with \nan increased risk of death were older age, history of smoking \nstatus, number of comorbidities, more advanced performance \nstatus, and active cancer.79 Moreover, a pooled meta-analysis \n6\t\nTobacco Use Insights ﻿\nshowed that the prevalence of respiratory diseases, specifically \nCOPD (OR 4.21; 95% CI, 2.9-6.0), and smoking (current \nsmoking OR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.16-3.39 and former smoking OR \n3.46; 95% CI, 2.46-4.85) were significantly associated with \nsevere COVID-19 outcomes.80 Another meta-analysis also \nshowed that current smokers were more likely to have an \nadverse outcome compared with non-current smokers (odds \nratio [OR]: 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06-2.20, P = .022) but less likely \ncompared with former smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27-0.74, \nP = .003).81 An older meta-analysis also found similar results: \ncurrent smokers were 1.45 times more likely (95% CI: 1.03-\n2.04) to have severe complications compared to former and \nnever smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality \nrate of 38.5%.69\nCOVID-19 disease state worsening by smoking is evidence \nbased, despite some studies claiming a reduced SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection risk in smoker population. In fact, a review assessing \nthe relationship between smoking status and some COVID-19 \ndisease outcomes (infection, hospitalization, disease severity, \nand mortality), showed no important association between being \na smoker and hospitalization or mortality and that current \nsmokers were at lower risk of getting infected with SARS-\nCoV-2 compared to never smokers. But the authors related \nthese results to study specific factors that complicated the inter-\npretation, including inverse causality.82 In all cases, it is impos-\nsible to prove causality through observational studies or to \nconduct interventional studies, except for smoking cessation tri-\nals in the general population and among patients after COVID.\nConfirmation of Smoking as a Risk Factor for \nCOVID-19 in vitro\nEven if smoking may not necessarily increase one’s risk for \ncontracting COVID-19, the biological and inflammatory cas-\ncade that occurs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection may be particu-\nlarly devastating for a smoker.83\nSmoking and demographics suggested mechanisms\nEvidence has shown that smoker patients with different \ncomorbidities (DM, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), COPD, \ncancer etc.) are at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. \nThey also have a worse prognosis for COVID-19 as well as for \ntheir comorbidities, especially for higher age patients. Older \nmen are in particular at higher risk of testing positive for \nCOVID-19 because smoking rates are highest for men, and \nolder male smokers will have smoked for most of their lives \n(causing maximum damage to their respiratory and cardiovas-\ncular systems In fact the SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid binds to \nsurface ACE2 and activates a cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 \n(an androgen-responsive gene highly expressed in men84) for \nprotein priming.85 Therefore, the higher expression of \nTMPRSS2 in men could increase their vulnerability to \nCOVID-19,84 thus explaining the higher morbidity and mor-\ntality associated with older age and male gender.86\nSmoking and comorbidities suggested mechanisms\nDM may aggravate the risk of severe COVID-1987 and mor-\ntality because it increases the surface expression of ACE2 \nthrough hyperinsulinemia,88 in addition to other synergistic \nmechanisms. DM is associated with immunodeficiency due to \nreduced TNF-α and impaired Treg cells, which facilitates \ninfections.88,89\nCVD patients are also predisposed to an increased risk of \nmore severe disease for many reasons. Hypertension is associ-\nated with a dysregulation in the immune system, manifested \nby elevated IL-17 levels and abnormal T-cell function.90 \nOther factors include overactive sympathetic drive and eleva-\ntions in angiotensin II, a pro-inflammatory peptide.91 ACE2 \nmodulators (ACE1 inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \nand thiazolidinediones), frequently used to treat hypertension, \nupregulate ACE2 expression.29\nFurthermore, the expression of ACE-2 receptors is increased \nin COPD, leading to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including \nstructural damage to lungs, lower immunity, and increased \nmucous production and airway blocking.92 Consequently, \nhigher morbidity and mortality are associated with chronic \nlung diseases.86\nPatients suffering from any malignancy, exacerbated by \nsmoking, are also at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 \ninfection due to the weak immunity providing an efficient viral \nreplication environment.93\nAdditional smoking suggested mechanisms\nThe impact of the toxic constituents of tobacco products on \nendothelial function has been thoroughly discussed. Studies \nhave shown that smoking (cigarettes, waterpipe, and e-ciga-\nrette) may have contributed to an increased burden of COVID-\n19 symptoms and severe health consequences.94 In vitro, the \nacute exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithe-\nlial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate \nimmune response and the proliferation of airway basal stem \ncells and has implications for disease spread and severity in \npeople exposed to cigarette smoke, with a more severe viral \ninfection and cell death.95 Furthermore, the viral entry has \nbeen shown to cause cytokine storm involving excessive pro-\nduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including \nIL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-7, IP-10, MCP-3, or GM-CSF, \nwhich is increased by smoking.96 Also, the expression levels of \nTMPRSS4, a gene coding for a protease that primes SARS-\nCoV-2 for cell entry similarly to TMPRSS2, were elevated in \nbronchial epithelial cells from current smokers compared with \nnever smokers, suggesting that higher bronchial TMPRSS4 \nlevels in smokers might put them at higher risk for SARS-\nCov-2 infection.97\nChronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell \npopulation and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In \ncontrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these \nHaddad et al\t\n7\nsecretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Thus, ACE2 expres-\nsion is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upreg-\nulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken \ntogether, these results may partly explain why smokers are par-\nticularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. \nFurthermore, ACE2 was identified as an interferon-stimulated \ngene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections \ncould create positive feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels \nand facilitate viral dissemination.98 This biological phenome-\nnon could also apply to new electronic smoking devices such as \nelectronic cigarettes and “heat-not-burn” IQOS devices.20 In \nthe same line, smoking may upregulate ACE2 expression \nthrough the upregulation of the androgen pathway. These data \nprovide a potential model for the increased susceptibility of \nsmoking patients to COVID-19.99\nFinally, increased age, comorbidities, smoking status, and \nrecent chemotherapy were associated with higher viral load. In \nturn, a high viral load (OR = 6) was linked to an increased need \nfor intubation (OR = 3) and in-hospital mortality.100\nFuture Perspectives\nFurther investigations of the interaction between smoking and \nCOVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of con-\ntracting COVID-19 among smokers, and the progression to \nmechanical ventilation or death in patients who suffer from it. \nAlso, further systematic review and meta-analysis studies are \nneeded that could provide a critical analyses of the available \ndata suggesting Covid19 susceptibilities amongst smokers. \nRisk factors for COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes, are all \nstrongly associated with smoking habits.101 Thus, the probabil-\nity of a beneficial effect of smoking on COVID-19 outcomes is \nmanifestly unlikely. Future investigation should focus on \nhomogenizing variables’ definitions, leading to less heterogene-\nity and easier results interpretation.\nAuthors of potentially controversial articles should thus \nrestrain from promoting their results before the peer-review \nprocess is complete,102 given all the limitations and biases that \nthey could include, and the false message they could convey. \nThis may be particularly exploited by tobacco industry to pro-\nmote smoking as not only safe activity but as preventive agent \nfrom COVID-19 complications. Furthermore, given the likely \nbenefits of smoking cessation in vulnerable populations, the \ncurrent pandemic should provide an opportunity to enforce \nsmoking cessation in health facilities (including mental health) \nand encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside smok-\ning cessation counseling, to increase the rate of quitting.103-105 \nFor instance, studies aiming at assessing smokers’ attitude \ntoward quitting smoking during the pandemic, showed \nincreased motivation to quit and decreased quantity of smok-\ning.106 This may offer for policy makers a strong justification \nfor implementing strong antismoking campaigns while making \nquitting practices available and affordable for the general pub-\nlic. Moreover, nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or modulators of \nnicotinic receptors may play a potential therapeutic role in \nCOVID-19, owing to their varied effects, including mood reg-\nulation, anti-inflammatory, as well as purported interference \nwith SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.107 The hypothesis \nthat nicotine may have a protective effect against COVID-19, \npartially masked by smoking-related toxicity and abrupt cessa-\ntion of nicotine consumption when smokers are hospitalized, \nneed to be explored in laboratory studies using nicotine-based \npharmaceutical products.81 Additionally, its role in the preven-\ntion and treatment of COVID-19 should be evaluated in \nappropriate placebo-controlled trials.104\nLimitations of epidemiological data\nSmoking contributes to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality as \nexplained by several biological mechanisms, while epidemiologi-\ncal data is not conclusive whether smoking is associated with \nincreased odds of infection as well as worse disease state. The \ninconclusive results may be due to some limitations. First data \nwas not collected directly from the participants (due to the \napplied social distancing policies). These were rather provided by \ndata banks (like the European bank or the WHO data. . .), so \nquestions about smoking habits may not have adequately \nreported. Also some hospitalized COVID-19 patients may also \nhave been unable to communicate and disclose their smoking \nhabits because of their critical condition. Some inflated results \nmay be due to the fact that current smokers, negative for COVID-\n19, confusing their chronic smoking symptoms (cough, increased \nsputum, altered sense of smell or taste) with those of COVID-\n19) with those of COVID-19, and may present for testing more \nfrequently than nonsmokers.82 Studies taking into consideration \npotential confounders, selection and information biases are rec-\nommended. Finally, tobacco industry may have exploited some \ninvestigations drawbacks to diffuse falsified studies about the \nbenefits of smoking as a protective agent against COVID-19.\nIn conclusion, physicians and public health professionals \nshould adequately collect detailed data from trusted sources on \nsmoking as part of clinical management to draw useful conclu-\nsions for policy makers to adopt. This will promote smoking \ncessation as a lead practice, contributing to the mitigation of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.71 Further studies, including sys-\ntematic reviews and meta-analyses, and studies with appropri-\nate assessment of potential confounders and bias minimization, \nare necessary to conclude about the association of smoking \nwith CIVID-19 severity and fatality.\nORCID iDs \nChadia Haddad \n https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2413-2684\nHala Sacre \n https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6547-6251\nReferences\n\t\n1.\t\nBommele J, Hopman P, Walters BH, et al.

This \npaper presents a meta-analysis of the association between smoking and progression of the infec-\ntious disease COVID-19.\nMethods:  PubMed was searched on April 28, 2020, with search terms “smoking”, “smoker*”, “char-\nacteristics”, “risk factors”, “outcomes”, and “COVID-19”, “COVID”, “coronavirus”, “sar cov-2”, “sar cov 2”. \nStudies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease were selected \nfor the final analysis. The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already \nhad the disease. A random effects meta-analysis was applied.\nResults:  We identified 19 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 11,590 COVID-19 patients, 2,133 \n(18.4%) with severe disease and 731 (6.3%) with a history of smoking. A total of 218 patients with a \nhistory of smoking (29.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 17.6% of non-smoking \npatients. The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of \nCOVID-19 (OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.59, p = 0.001).  Limitations in the 19 papers \nsuggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher.\nConclusions:  Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher \nodds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers.\nImplications:  Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of \nclinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIntroduction\nCOVID-19, the coronavirus-transmitted infectious disease, has \ncaused a worldwide pandemic. Smoking1,2 and e-cigarette use3 in-\ncrease risk and severity of pulmonary infections because of damage \nto upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function. In \nparticular, smokers have a higher risk of infection and mortality from \nCov-MERS.4 Two reviews5,6 of the first five papers presenting data on \nsmoking and COVID-19 reached different conclusions. Another re-\nview described six published case series presenting data on smoking \namong COVID-19 patients but did not draw a conclusion about the \nassociation of severity of COVID-19 with smoking.7 We reviewed \nand summarized 19 peer-reviewed papers presenting data on the as-\nsociation between smoking and severity of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic search using PubMed on April 28, 2020, \nwith the search term: ((smoking) OR (characteristics) OR (risk \nfactors) OR (outcomes) OR (smoker*)) AND ((COVID-19) OR \n(COVID) OR (coronavirus) OR (sars cov-2) OR (sars cov 2)) for \nstudies published between January 1, 2020 and April 28, 2020.

There were no language restrictions. A total of 907 studies \nwere retrieved through the search, of which 19,8–26 16 from China, 1 \nfrom Korea, and 2 from the United States, included data on smoking \nbehavior and COVID-19 disease progression (Supplementary Table \nS1). Seventeen studies9–12,14–26 were based on hospitalized patients \nand two8,13 included both hospitalized patients and outpatients.\nThe exposure group for our analysis were those who had a his-\ntory of smoking (current smokers or former smokers) and unexposed \ngroup was never smokers. Nine studies10,12,14,18,20,21,23,25,26 assessed \nwhether the patient was a “current smoker,” five studies8,9,13,16,24 \nassessed whether the patient was a current or former smoker  \n(as separate categories), and five studies11,15,17,19,22 assessed whether \nthe patient had a “history of smoking” (current or former).\nOutcomes were progression of COVID-19 to more severe or crit-\nical conditions or death. Six studies11,16,20,21,23,24 categorized the out-\ncome as severe or critical (respiratory distress with respiratory rate \n≥30/min, or oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, or oxygenation index \n≤300  mm Hg, based on the diagnostic and treatment guideline for \nSARS-CoV-2 issued by Chinese National Health Committee or the \nAmerican Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneu-\nmonia23,24) or nonsevere, three10,17,18 categorized the outcome as pro-\ngression or improvement, two8,14 categorized the outcome as intensive \ncare unit (ICU) admission or non-ICU admission, one13 categorized the \noutcome as the primary composite endpoint (ICU admission, the use \nof mechanical ventilation, or death) or not, three9,22,26 categorized the \noutcome as death or survivor, one19 categorized the outcome as the \noccurrence of severe cases (without defining severe) or death or mild, \none study15 categorized the outcome as clinical deterioration during \nthe hospitalization and needed supplemental oxygen therapy, one12 cat-\negorized the outcome as a need of intensive mechanical ventilators, \nand one25 categorized the outcome as abnormal chest imaging findings.\nWe also conducted sensitivity analysis using the five studies8,9,13,16,24 \nthat we were able to compare the association of severity of COVID-\n19 between current smokers and never smokers.\nWe computed unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence \ninterval (CI) for each study using the number of smokers (current \nand former) and never smokers with and without disease progres-\nsion.

A total of 218 \npatients with a history of smoking (29.8%) experienced disease \nprogression, compared with 17.6% of nonsmoking patients. \nThe meta-analysis showed an association between smoking and \nCOVID-19 progression (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.42–2.59, p = .001) \n(Figure 1). There was moderate heterogeneity among the studies \n(I2 = 38%, p = .048) and no significant evidence of publication bias \n(Harbord’s p = .813, Peters’ p = .941).\nSensitivity analysis of the five studies8,9,13,16,24 of current smokers \nversus never smokers yielded a similar result (OR 1.91, 95% CI \n1.10–3.29, p = .021). There was no evidence of significant heterogen-\neity (I2 = 53.5%, p = .072) or publication bias (Harbord’s p = .382, \nPeters’ p = .512) among the studies.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis confirms that smoking is a risk factor for progression of \nCOVID-19, with smokers having 1.91 times the odds of progression \nin COVID-19 severity than never smokers. This finding contrasts with \nan earlier meta-analysis,6 which included only five studies and used a \nnonstandard method to compute the meta-analysis. The finding that \nsmoking is associated with COVID-19 progression is not surprising be-\ncause of the adverse effects of smoking on pulmonary immune function.1,2\nSome27,28 have argued that the fact that reported smoking preva-\nlence in COVID patients is lower than has been reported in the general \npopulation as evidence for a protective effect of smoking. As noted \nabove, the low prevalence reported among COVID patients may be due \nto under-assessment of smoking, especially in the difficult conditions \npresent when caring for people in overwhelmed health systems.29,30 \nIn any event, our analysis shows that among those people assessed as \nsmokers risk of disease progression is significantly increased.\nLimitations\nThe definition of “smoking” sometimes includes former smokers and \nsometimes does not. Only three studies8,13,24 separated current and \nformer smokers in different categories, which was not enough data \nto do a meta-analysis for current and former smokers separately. \nBecause the lung recovers after someone stops smoking, including \nformer smokers in the exposed group may bias the effect estimate \nto the null. Reported smoking prevalence in the 16 studies in China \nranged from 3.7% to 16.8%, which was substantially lower than \n27.7% (52.1% for men and 2.7% for women) smoking preva-\nlence in 2015.31 Reported smoking prevalence in the United States \n(3.6–5.1%) and Korea (18.5%) studies were also lower than the \ncountries’ smoking prevalence; US smoking prevalence in 2018 was \n13.7% (15.6% for men and 12.0% for women)32 and Korea in 2017 \nwas 21.1% (37.0% for men and 5.2% for women).33 It is highly \nlikely that many smokers were misclassified as nonsmokers, which \nwould bias the risk estimate toward the null.\nThis analysis is based on unadjusted ORs that were either re-\nported in the studies17 or that we calculated based on counts in the \nstudies.8–16,18–26 Only one17 of the studies reported unadjusted and ad-\njusted ORs using multivariate analysis; after adjusting for confounding \nby age, maximum temperature at admission, respiratory failure, severe \nillness, albumin, creatinine, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein level, \nthe effect of smoking on disease severity increased (unadjusted: OR \n12.19, 95% CI 1.76–84.31, p = .011; adjusted: OR 14.29, 95% CI \n1.58–25.0, p = .018). Three peer-reviewed meta-analysis papers6,34,35 \non association between smoking and COVID-19 were also based on \nunadjusted ORs, but with fewer studies included.\nNone of these studies assessed e-cigarette use.\nAll these limitations suggest that this analysis underestimates the \nrisk of smoking in terms of increasing COVID-19 severity.\nAll 19 studies were of patients who had already developed \nCOVID-19, so the risk estimate we report does not represent the ef-\nfect of smoking on the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the general \npopulation. As population-level testing ramps up, it would be useful \nto collect data on smoking and e-cigarette use to determine what \nrisks these behaviors impose in terms of infection.\nConclusions\nSmoking is associated with COVID-19 disease progression. \nPhysicians and public health professionals should collect data on \nsmoking and, given the pulmonary effects of e-cigarettes,3 e-cigarette \nuse as part of clinical assessments and add smoking (and, to be health \nprotective, e-cigarette) cessation to the list of practices to blunt the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nSupplementary Material\nA Contributorship Form detailing each author’s specific involvement with this \ncontent, as well as any supplementary data, are available online at https://\nacademic.oup.com/ntr.\nSupplementary data are available at Nicotine & Tobacco Research online.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by National Institute of Drug Abuse grant \nR01DA043950, cooperative agreement U54HL147127 from the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Food and Drug Administration \nCenter for Tobacco Products and the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi \nHospital, Mahidol University, Thailand.

Eakin and Enid Neptune\nDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\npandemic has had a devastating impact\nglobally with millions of individuals infected\nand a rising death toll that now surpasses\none million (1). It is therefore critical to\nidentify risk factors for worse outcomes\nrelated to the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\nvirus. The use of tobacco products is such a\npotential risk factor, given its adverse effects\non health and the high prevalence of use.\nBoth electronic and combustible tobacco\nproducts have been shown to cause damage\nto the lungs (2, 3) and to alter the immune\nsystem response leading to increased\nsusceptibility to most respiratory viruses.\nAlthough research is ongoing, there are\nseveral proposed mechanisms by which\nSARS-CoV-2 may increase susceptibility to\ninfection or lead to worse clinical outcomes.\nOverall, the epidemiological data are\nmixed on whether tobacco use increases the\nrisk of COVID-19 infection. However, there\nis clear evidence that tobacco use is\nassociated with worse clinical outcomes,\nincluding the risk of mortality, with current\nsmokers having a greater risk of in-hospital\ndeath (9.4% compared with 5.6% for\nnonsmokers) (4–6). The OpenSAFELY study\nlinked electronic health records with\nin-hospital deaths in the United Kingdom,\nfor approximately 17 million individuals in\nthe United Kingdom. Accounting only for\nage and sex, smokers and former smokers\nhad a 25% and 80%, respectively, higher risk\nof mortality compared with nonsmokers (7).\nWith regard to incident infection, meta-\nanalyses have shown that current smokers\nare at a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2\ninfection (8). However, the literature is\ngenerally ﬂawed by signiﬁcant heterogeneity\non how smoking status was determined,\nleading to missing data, inability to separate\ncurrent, former, and never-smokers, reliance\non self-report or electronic medical records,\nand lack of data on frequency and duration\nof use of tobacco products. Furthermore, in\nmany of these studies, there is a high\nrepresentation of healthcare workers who are\nless likely to smoke than the general\npopulation but are at greater risk of exposure\nto SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, emerging\nevidence suggests that the use of electronic\ncigarette products is linked to a ﬁvefold\ngreater likelihood of testing positive for\nCOVID-19 (9). This study, however, relied\non an Internet panel and self-report. These\ndata suggest a smoking paradox for COVID-\n19, with current smokers being at a lower\nrisk for infection but at a signiﬁcantly greater\nrisk for worse outcomes.\nWhat are the possible mechanisms by\nwhich smoking could affect SARS-CoV-2\ninfection and the outcome of COVID-19?\nThe smoking-related comorbidities\n(cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease [COPD]) provide the\nmost coherent connection between smoking\nand COVID-19 severity. However, several\ndisease mechanisms, anchored in smoking-\nassociated lung injury, altered host defenses,\nand the unique aspects of SARS-CoV-2\ninfectivity, are also relevant.\nAirway and Airspace Injury (Direct\nToxic Effects)\nSmoking delivers myriad tissue toxicants to\nthe lung that can culminate in geographic\ninjury to both airway and airspace\ncompartments. Although the pathologic\neffects of tobacco smoke on the oropharynx\nare well known and underscore the risk of\nmalignancy, the involvement of the nasal\nepithelium, the recognized portal of entry for\nSARS-CoV-2, is less well described. Limited\nsurveys of chronic smokers and animal\nmodels of smoke exposure do show nasal\nepithelial pathology that approximates\nchanges in the proximal airway with epithelial\ncell loss and expansion of mucosecretory cells\n(10–12). Nasal and smell dysfunction,\nsignature presenting symptoms in COVID-\n19, are frequent in chronic smokers\nimplicating common injury mechanisms. As\nof this writing, no studies of viral abundance\nin smokers versus nonsmokers with COVID-\n19 have been published.\nLower airway pathology featuring\nepithelial metaplasia, dysfunctional ciliated\ncells, goblet cell hyperplasia, and secretory\ngland expansion are known consequences of\nchronic smoke exposure (13–15). This battery\nof effects certainly impairs viral clearance given\nthe compromise of the mucociliary apparatus\n(16). The smoke-induced production of\ndamaging oxidants compromises tissue repair\nand confers enhanced susceptibility to\ninfection (17). Whether the altered airway\nepithelial composition enhances viral\ninfectivity is unknown, but answers to that\nquestion will be informed by advanced\n(Received in original form December 15, 2020; accepted in ﬁnal form February 26, 2021)\nThis article is open access and distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives License 4.0.\nFor commercial usage and reprints, please e-mail Diane Gern.\nCorrespondence and requests for reprints should be addressed to Enid Neptune, M.D., Medicine/Pulmonary and Critical Care, Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, Room 549, 1830 East Monument Street, Baltimore, MD 21205.

Smoking is a known risk\nfactor for inﬂuenza infection, potentially\nreﬂecting a broad susceptibility across\nrespiratory viruses (18–20). Airway\nepithelial cells exposed to whole smoke or\nisolated from smokers display attenuated\ninterferon signaling with poly I:C\ntreatment or viral infections (21–23).\nNicotine also suppresses interferon-\nmediated antiviral responses in cell\nsystems (24). Taken together, active\nsmoking creates a proviral milieu that is\npotentially exploited by many respiratory\nviruses.\nAlteration in Angiotensin-\nConverting Enzyme 2 Abundance\nSuccessful SARS-CoV-2 infection of airway\nepithelial cells involves a coordinated series\nof molecular events. The initial trigger is the\nSARS-CoV-2 spike protein engagement with\nangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors,\nfollowed by a protease-mediated activation of\nmembrane fusion and then use of the\nendocytic machinery to facilitate viral\nreplication and eventual release from the\ndying cell. Does smoking impact any of these\ncritical events? Many consider measurable or\nelevated lung angiotensin-converting enzyme\n2 expression as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2\ninfection and the effect of smoking on the\nexpression of lung angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 has been examined by scores of\ninvestigators. As angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 harbors known lung-protective\neffects, largely exerted by enhancing\ncounterregulatory renin–angiotensin\nsignaling, the increased expression could\neither facilitate viral engagement or serve to\nreinforce host defenses or both. Among\npublished studies, there is an\noverrepresentation of analyses of RNA\ndatasets from lungs of smokers compared\nwith nonsmokers or from resident lung cells.\nFindings from these studies have been\nvariable with most showing persuasive\nevidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\ninduction among smokers, whereas others\nshow no signiﬁcant difference (25–31).\nFurthermore, the few studies that measured\nangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein in\nthe lungs or in the resident cells of\nsmokers versus nonsmokers show a modest\nincrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\nexpression with active smoking (32).\nA strenuous exploration of how and\nwhether tobacco smoke or nicotine\nexposure affects coronavirus 2 infectivity or\nviral titers is needed to provide context to\nthe angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\nexpression data.\nDisturbances in RAS Signaling\nAlterations in renin–angiotensin system\n(RAS) signaling plausibly underscore\nselective manifestations of COVID-19\nbecause the virus receptor is an angiotensin\nprocessing enzyme that seems to be\ndownregulated on acute lung injury and/or\ncoronavirus infection (33–36). The loss of\ncritical angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\nfunctions such as the 1) degradation of\nproinﬂammatory angiotensin II (AngII), 2)\ncomplex tissue-protective effects, and, in its\nsoluble form, 3) possible antiviral decoy\ninteractions may serve to enable virulence,\ninfectivity, and overall morbidity (37–39).\nThe tissue-protective effects of angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 are believed to reside in\nthe coupled hydrolysis of AngII and\nproduction of Ang1–7. Blood AngII\nconcentration are elevated in patients with\nCOVID-19 and associated with the degree of\nhypoxia (40). Despite evidence that\nantagonism of conventional RAS signaling\nresulting in reduced AngII production\nprotects against cigarette smoke–induced\nlung injury in experimental COPD and is\nassociated with improved COPD outcomes,\nwhether such approaches might improve\nCOVID-19 morbidity in smokers is\nunknown (41–43). Clearly, measurements of\nthe activity of RAS processing enzymes and\nthe resultant product peptides in smoking\nand nonsmoking patients with COVID-19\nwould provide some guidance for pilot\ntherapeutic studies.\nNicotine Signaling and\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection\nThere is an argument that nicotine exposure\nand signaling could paradoxically reduce\nSARS-CoV-2 infection and morbidity (44).\nNicotine has well-established\nantiinﬂammatory effects that reside in its\ninteraction with the a7 subtype of nicotinic\nreceptors, but it has varied effects on\ninterferon-mediated antiviral cascades\n(45–48). Nicotine also induces angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 expression in primary\nairway epithelial cells in a dose-dependent\nmanner (49). A transcriptomic survey of\nairway epithelial cells shows a signiﬁcant\npositive correlation between angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 expression and the a7\nnicotinic receptor expression (50). Delivery\nand context may also contribute to nicotine-\nspeciﬁc effects on COVID-19. Low-level\nexposures to nicotine containing e-cigarette\nvapor increase lung inﬂammation and\nangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression\nin an a7 nicotinic receptor–dependent\nfashion (51). The preponderance of data does\nnot currently support a therapeutic role for\nnicotine in COVID-19, but further studies\nelucidating the speciﬁc effects of nicotine in a\nvariety of delivery contexts are needed.\nFurthermore, given the public health\nconsequences of nicotine dependence,\ncaution is the most prudent posture.\nSummary and Perspective\nGiven the adverse impact of nicotine\nproduct use on COVID-19 outcomes, it is\ncritical to continue to promote treatments\nfor nicotine dependence as a public health\ngoal. The possible opposing effects of\nnicotine on the SARS-CoV-2 infection/\nmorbidity axis create a strong incentive to\ndissect this complex relationship of smoking\nand COVID-19 pathogenesis. Future\nresearch efforts must disentangle this\nassociation. Objectives include 1) more\nexpansive epidemiological population\nhealth data that includes clear metrics for\nassessing smoking status; 2) preclinical\nresearch that models relevant aspects of\ncigarette smoke exposure and SARS-CoV-2\ninfection to reveal the critical mechanisms\nthat contribute to disease development and\nmorbidity; and 3) mechanistic parsing of\nlung nicotine delivery to delineate\nimportant paracrine and autocrine\ninteractions between nicotine signaling and\nPERSPECTIVE\nPerspective\n1611\n \nvirus: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\nengagement and processing. The inclusion\nof smoking/vaping status in vaccine trials\ncould yield enlightening data on infectivity\nrates by tobacco product exposure. By\ncombining careful cohort phenotyping for\ntobacco product exposures and disease\nexpression with informative preclinical\nstudies, the complex relationship between\nsmoking and COVID-19 can be better\nelucidated and ultimately serve public\nhealth objectives. \u0001\nAuthor disclosures are available with the\ntext of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nReferences\n1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Our study was the first\nto highlight potential sex-specific consequences for smoking on COVID-19 outcomes that\nmight further explain the higher vulnerability to death from this disease among men.\nIntroduction\nUntil we reach a global herd immunity or until an effective treatment for coronavirus disease\n(COVID-19) has been identified and proven efficacious, identifying and managing clinical risk\nfactors as a supportive treatment strategy can help reduce the mortality rate among those severely\naffected by COVID-19 [1]. Smoking, as an avoidable risk factor, was proposed to be targeted as\nan effective intervention strategy that can impact poor outcomes for those with COVID-19 [2, 3].\nInitially, some clinical and epidemiological studies claimed that smokers were less likely to be hos-\npitalized due to COVID-19 while others refuted these findings by reporting a high smoking prev-\nalence in their hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts compared to that of the study’s general\npopulation [4, 5]. In terms of prognosis and mortality, contradictory results were also reported.\nFor example, Lippi et al. pointed out that active smoking is not associated with severity of the dis-\nease while others showed that smoking patients might have higher risk for mortality compared to\nnon-smokers [3, 6]. These research studies, meta-analysis and systematic reviews emphasized on\nthe importance of evaluating larger COVID-19 cohorts among different populations, especially\nfrom low socioeconomic countries where smoking presents a major public health burden [7–9].\nThe high smoking prevalence in the Lebanese population combined with the low socioeco-\nnomic status of this country encouraged us to study the effect of smoking on COVID-19 out-\ncomes in the resultant cohort [10, 11]. Thus, we investigated the impact of smoking on 743\nhospitalized COVID-19 patients from Lebanon with respect to their disease outcomes and\nmortality rates. On the other hand, sex and smoking have been independently proposed as risk\nfactors for increased susceptibility and host severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet none of\nthese studies has interrogated the interaction between these two factors on COVID-19 out-\ncomes [2]. Knowing that smoking adverse health consequences vary significantly between\nmen and women, we investigated if this discrepancy plays a role when it comes to COVID-19\nmortality rates. By examining a large representative cohort from the Middle-East region, we\nwere the first to highlight a potential novel sex-discrepancy in the association of smoking on\nthe survival rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to confirm that smoking might be a\ncritical risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.\nMethods\nStudy participants\nIn this pilot study we collected retrospectively data for all hospitalized COVID-19 adults\n(defined as > 15 years old) who were admitted to Rafik Hariri University Hospital (RHUH).\nRHUH is the main governmental public hospital in Lebanon that was assigned as the leading\ncenter for COVID-19 testing and treatment in the country [12].\nInclusion Criteria: A diagnosis for COVID-19 was established when a patient tested positive\nfor SARS-CoV-2 by PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab and had COVID-19 pneumonia\naccording to the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic\nPLOS ONE\nSmoking and COVID-19 mortality\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255692\nAugust 5, 2021\n2 / 10\nof China (PRC). Our study patients were those classified as being moderate, severe or critical\nCOVID-19 cases as per the interim guidelines of the World Health Organization and the\nNational Health Commission of China [13, 14]. Briefly, 1) moderate cases were patients with\nfever, respiratory symptoms, and imaging presentations of pneumonia that needed or were at\nhigh risk for oxygenation, 2) severe cases were those with any of the following clinical presenta-\ntions: respiratory distress with RR>30 time/min, oxygen saturation at rest <93%, or PaO2/\nFiO2 <300 mmHg(I mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and 3) critically severe cases were patients with any\nof the following: respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation, shock, or combination with\nother organ failure. Overall, both severe and critical cases were admitted to the Intensive Care\nUnit (ICU). Mild cases were excluded from this study since the investigated outcomes (ICU\nadmission and mortality) are not usually reported among these patients. All the enrolled\npatients received supportive and therapeutic modalities based on an inpatient guide and a\ndefined treatment strategy for all patients admitted to the hospital at the same period of time.\nData\nThe electronic medical records of COVID-19 patients admitted to RHUH between the 1st of Feb-\nruary until the 31 of October 2020 were accessed in November 2020. The data was de-identified\nby the study coordinator before the authors have had access to it. The obtained data included\npatient demographics, self-reported smoking history (current cigarette smoking), ICU admission,\ntotal number of days spent in the hospital, and the final outcome was defined as death or dis-\ncharged. Outcomes for current smokers were compared to that of never and former smokers com-\nbined together. The study was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration\nof Helsinki, and was approved by the Rafik Hariri University Hospital Institutional Review Board.\nPatients who were hospitalized for isolation and quarantine reasons were excluded from\nthe study. Seven hundred forty-three (N = 743) patients met the study inclusion criteria and\nwere analyzed for study outcomes. No missing data were reported among all enrolled patients.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables were presented as absolute numbers or percentages. Continuous variables\nwere expressed as mean values ± Standard Deviation (SD). Differences of the studied parame-\nters between discharged and dead COVID-19 patients were evaluated by student’s t-test for\nparametric data. Logistic regression was used for each studied parameter over the binary out-\ncome (discharged/death) using a univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses\nwere used to assess the association between age, sex, smoking and the need for ICU admission\nor the reported death incidence. Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were\nreported. Survival curves were visually presented by Kaplan-Meier curves. The survival distribu-\ntions of smokers and non-smokers were compared using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Survival\nanalysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazards models that were adjusted for age and\nstratified by sex. Assessing interaction between smoking and sex was conducted in an additional\nage-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model that included the sex factor. Hazard ratio (HR)\nand the 95% CI were reported. All tests were two tailed and considered significant when p-value\n<0.05. All data were analyzed using SPSS software (Version 23.0, IBM).\nResults\nGeneral characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients\nSeven hundred forty-three patients met the study inclusion criteria. The mean age of all\nenrolled patients was 49.7 ± 19.04 years with the majority of 463 patients (62.3%) being men.\nPLOS ONE\nSmoking and COVID-19 mortality\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255692\nAugust 5, 2021\n3 / 10\nThe mean number of days stayed in the hospital among our patients was 11.32± 8.17 days\nwhile only 160 (21.5%) patients needed admission to the ICU. Death was reported among 81\npatients (17.4%). Of all patients, 314 (42.3%) reported to be current active cigarette smokers.\nThere was no difference in mortality rate between males and females while the mean age of\npatients who died was higher than those who survived (65.4 ± 15.77 vs 47.8 ± 18.53 years,\np<0.001). Compared to discharged patients, those who died presented a higher percentage of\nsmoking behavior (60.5 vs 40%, p<0.001) and a longer length of stay in the hospital\n(14.98 ± 10.52 vs 10.87 ±7.73 days) with more frequent need for ICU admission (80.2% vs\n14.4%, p<0.001) (Table 1).\nCharacteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients as per their smoking\nstatus\nSmokers were more likely to be males (70.7% males vs 29.3% females) and to have a higher\nmean age (54.31 ±17.98 years) as compared to nonsmokers (46.30 ±19.12 years). Death inci-\ndence among smokers was approximately double that of non-smokers (15.6% vs 7.5%). ICU\nadmission was higher among smokers (28.3%) with a longer length of stay in the hospital\n(12.03 days ±7.78) (Table 1). In a univariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio of\ndeath (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.43–3.68, p<0.001) and ICU admission (OR = 2, 95%\nCI = 1.400–2.841, p<0.001) was high among smoker as compared to non-smokers\n(Table 2). In a multivariate analysis, age and smoking status remained significantly associ-\nated with death and ICU admission. The sex factor by itself or in combination with the\nother factors was not associated with the detected outcomes. To compare the survival times\nbetween smokers and non-smokers, Kaplan-Meier estimates were plotted (Fig 1). A worse\nsurvival rate was observed among smokers with a median survival of 30.4 days (95% CI 25.4\nto 35.4 days) as compared to 47.5 days (95% CI 29.8 to 65.2 days) in non-smokers. The sig-\nnificance of survival trends that was observed in between the groups was confirmed by\nMantel-Cox log-rank test (p = 0.004).\nTable 1.

Thus, we investigated whether this discrepancy plays a role when it comes to\nCOVID-19 mortality rates. Our cohort presented a comparable profile between males and\nfemales with no significant difference in age, ICU admission, length of stay in hospital and\ndeath incidence (Table 1). Once stratified by sex, only the survival analysis among men showed\na significant difference between smokers and non-smokers (Fig 2). In a univariate logistic\nregression analysis, the odds ratio for death (OR: 3, 95% CI = 1.6–5.7, p = 0.001) and ICU\nadmission (OR: 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4–3.6, p = 0.001) was significantly higher in smoking men as\ncompared to non-smoking men (S1 Table). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression\nmodel adjusted for age, the most significant risk factor for mortality among COVID-19\npatients, demonstrated that current smoking is an independent risk factor for reduced survival\ntime from admission to death in men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9 [95% confidence interval (CI),\n1.029–3.616]; P = 0.041). The Cox model evaluating the interaction of sex and smoking status\nwas also significant (p = 0.015). Neither the logistic regression analysis nor the Cox propor-\ntional hazard regression model adjusted for age showed a significant difference in the survival\nrate among women with respect to their smoking status ([HR], 0.79 [95% CI = 0.374–1.689];\np = 0.551) (S1 Table).\nDiscussion\nLebanon as a developing country with a low-middle income profile was ranked third globally\nfor having the most smokers per capita for both sexes.

Thus,\nevaluating the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes in this country is highly\nrepresentative and informative [16]. In this study, the smoking prevalence (42.3%) among 743\nhospitalized COVID-19 patients exceeded the prevalence of tobacco users (38%) in the Leba-\nnese general population and was higher than those reported by other COVID-19 cohorts [17,\n18] Additionally, elevated odds ratios for ICU admission and death was detected among our\nsmoking patients by both univariate and multivariate analysis. Thus, our results were consis-\ntent with most of the well-designed epidemiological studies that revealed smoking as an inde-\npendent risk factor that can worsen in-hospital outcomes and increases mortality rates among\nCOVID-19 patients [3, 19–22]. Collectively, such results infer adding smoking as a risk factor\nfor worse COVID-19 prognosis and highlight the importance of smoking cessation amidst this\npandemic [22]. Yet, none of these studies investigated the results consistency between smoking\nmen and women. In this study we were the first to report a potential noteworthy sex-discrep-\nancy in the association of smoking on COVID-19 mortality rates. Interestingly, current smok-\ning status was not associated with the need for ICU admission or with the survival outcomes\namong hospitalized COVID-19 female patients but rather showed that smoking men have\nreduced worse outcomes as compared to their non-smoking counterpart.\nSmoking adverse health consequences vary frequently between men and women [15]. The\nwidely accepted hypothesis reveals that although men have higher smoking prevalence com-\npared to women, the latter are at higher risk for smoking-related general health problems [23].\nHowever, concerning lung diseases, men may be more susceptible. For example, it has been\nproposed that maternal smoking during pregnancy has a greater tendency to cause lifelong ill-\nness among males rather than females [24]. Another study pinpointed that smoking men have\nFig 2. Kaplan-Meier survival curve for smokers (green line) and non-smokers (blue line) as stratified by Sex. A) F = Female (p = 0.893).

A signifi-\ncant representative cohort of 22,708 individuals demonstrated that smoking women were\nmore vulnerable for earlier death and risk of stroke as compared to smoking men, but less vul-\nnerable for lung disorders [26]. Since COVID-19 targets mainly the lungs, smoking-related\nlung disorders overlap with COVID-19 respiratory comorbidities that include chronic bron-\nchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [27, 28]. Additionally,\na more recent study by Naidu et. showed that the induction of angiotensin converting enzyme\n2 (ACE-2) in mouse lungs after e-cigarette vapor exposure is sex-specific. A more prominent\nnicotine-dependent increase in lung ACE-2 expression was detected in male mice as compared\nto female mice which can influences both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity\n[29]. Thus, the identified salient consequences for smoking among men in our cohort could be\nexplained by the fact that this group might have higher odds for developing lung disorders in\nresponse to tobacco smoking and/or due to the more prominent increase in the ACE-2 expres-\nsion among smoking male patients.\nThe main limitation of this study is the retrospective collection of our data which prevented\nus from further examining the implication of smoking habits (mild/heavy consumption, cur-\nrent/former) and comorbidities on the detected results. Although we cannot ignore a potential\ncofounding effect for these variables, many cohorts that accounted for comorbidities in their\nanalysis were still able to declare smoking as an independent risk factor that is not affected by\nspecific characteristics of the patients [3, 30, 31]. Taking into consideration these newly emerg-\ning reports and our relatively large size cohort, we anticipate that our results will not be highly\naffected once adjusted for other comorbidities. While our ability to detect a difference in mor-\ntality by smoking status among females may have been limited by the number of hospital-\nadmitted women in our stratified analyses, our pooled analysis demonstrated a significant\ninteraction of smoking status with sex. Furthermore, our sex-stratified results are consistent\nwith a recent study by Magfira et. al who demonstrated revealed a positive correlation between\nthe prevalence of adult male smoking and COVID-19 lethality in lower-middle-income coun-\ntries (LMIC) which was not detected among smoking females. This study showed that each\npercentage point increase in adult male smoking prevalence caused the Case fatality rate\n(CFR) of COVID-19 to increase by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p = 0.041) [32]. Taking into\nconsideration that our study was done in a LMIC, our results were consistent with this com-\nprehensive study to indicate a potential sex sensitivity for smoking in COVID-19 cases that is\nworth noting and investigating in prospective studies. On the other hand, tobacco dosage con-\nsumption might have a potential cofounding effect on COVID-19 morbidity and thus,\naccounting for smoking dosage might underlie the prominent morbidity among male\nCOVID-19 patients since men tend to have higher rates of cigarettes consumption per day as\ncompared to women [26]. Previous studies have showed that the detected global sex disparities\nin severity and mortality from COVID-19 could be driven by the higher presence of comor-\nbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung disease) in men or\ndue to the high-risk behaviors including smoking and alcohol use among this group. Yet, data\nfrom a recent large cohort indicated that sex-disparity in COVID-19 remained significant\neven after controlling for these potential confounders. In their study, the authors encourage\nfurther investigations on the biological pathways that may influence disease etiology rather\nthan pointing on the effect of other factors and comorbidities [33]. Thus, our data could fur-\nther highlight the importance of such investigations, especially that sex-discrepancy in the\neffect of smoking on heath outcome is a widely studied and accepted phenomena.\nIdentifying patients who are at higher risk for COVID-19 mortality will enable clinicians to\nintervene, allocate resources, and make more informed triage decisions [34]. Revealing smok-\ning as a modifiable risk factor for men can enhance our control to this disease by highlighting\nPLOS ONE\nSmoking and COVID-19 mortality\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255692\nAugust 5, 2021\n7 / 10\nthe importance of smoking cessation specifically among this group while categorizing priori-\nties during hospital admission. Our data suggest that adding sex-specific consequences for\nsmoking on COVID-19 outcomes could further explain why men are more vulnerable to\ndeath from this disease globally. This pilot study will open the door for further investigations\non the potential sex-discrepancy in the effect of smoking in COVID-19 while accounting for\ncomorbidities and smoking dosages.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.

Considering high smoking\nrates in Jordan, our current study aimed to assess the following domains in a community-based sample from Jordan: (i) the beliefs that surround\nsmoking/vaping and COVID-19 and (ii) the pandemic impact on smoking behavior and quit intention.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jordan from March 9 to March 16, 2021, utilizing a web-based structured questionnaire. The\nquestionnaire comprised 13 items on sociodemographic, health, and smoking proﬁles, 14 items to assess beliefs surrounding COVID-19 and the\nuse of combustible cigarettes (CCs), waterpipe (WP), and electronic cigarettes (ECs), and 12 items to assess the pandemic impact on smoking\nbehavior and quit intention.\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as speciﬁed on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nRESULTS: Of 2424 survey respondents who participated in our study, there were 1163 never-smokers, 1044 current smokers, and 217 ex-smokers.\nThe mean age of participants was 35.2 years (SD: 11.06). Most participants have reported anti-smoking beliefs with around 72.9% believed that WP\nsmoking is related to the risk of contracting COVID-19. Also, 71.7% believed that smoking CC may worsen the COVID-19 clinical course, while 74.1% of\nrespondents believed that smoking has no protective effect against COVID-19. During the pandemic, about 28.1% and 19.3% of current smokers\nreported increased or reduced smoking, respectively. Besides, 459 current smokers have expressed their plans/intention to quit smoking during the\npandemic, of whom 27.5% (n = 126) conﬁrmed that the driving force for their decision is a COVID-19-related reason, such as self-protection (n = 123)\nand protection of family members (n = 121) which were the most cited reasons. Also, around 63 participants have successfully ceased smoking during\nthe pandemic. However, only 22 of them reported that the main driving motivation of their successful quit attempt was the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCONCLUSION: Most participants’ beliefs and attitudes were against smoking during the pandemic. Nevertheless, the double-edged effect of the\npandemic on smoking habits should be carefully considered, and reliable anti-smoking measures should be strengthened and sustained in the\ncountry.\nKEYWORDS: COVID-19, pandemic, Jordan, smoking behavior, quit, tobacco\nTYPE: Original Research\nDECLARATION OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS The author(s) declared no potential conﬂicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFUNDING The author(s) received no ﬁnancial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nETHICAL APPROVAL The protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional\nreview board at Applied Science Private University in Jordan (Ref. 2021-PHA-7).\nINFORMED CONSENT All participants have provided online written informed consent.\nDATA AVAILABILITY The dataset generated and analyzed in the current study is available from\nthe corresponding author on a reasonable request.\nCORRESPONDING AUTHOR: L´aszló Róbert Kolozsv´ari, MD, PhD Department of Family and\nOccupational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Móricz Zs. krt. 22,\nDebrecen, 4032, Hungary. Email: kolozsvari.laszlo@med.unideb.hu\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has\nsigniﬁcantly impacted most life domains, including economy,\npolitics, education, social life, travel, entertainment, and health\nservices provision.1-3 To retard the spread of the disease, most\ncountries have applied several mitigation strategies including\nrestrictions on international travel, closing universities and\nschools, and enforcing face-masking, physical distancing, and\nquarantine/lockdowns.4-6\nUnfortunately,\nthe\ninﬂuence\nof\nCOVID-19 induced stress and lockdowns came up with\nsubstantial socio-economic and psychological consequences.7-14\nDespite various mitigation measures and vaccination rollouts,15\nthe COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality are still rising\nglobally, with over 216 million conﬁrmed cases and more than\n4.4 million deaths as of August 30, 2021.16 In Jordan, a middle-\nincome country in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR),\nthe situation is not different as the country has been severely\nafﬂicted by the pandemic with a total of 739 847 conﬁrmed\ncases and 9530 fatalities as of August 30, 2021.17 The successive\npandemic waves accompanied by many factors such as people’s\nnon-compliance to the recommended health precautions,\npandemic fatigue, and the pandemic-induced psychologic and\neconomic impacts were all believed to have negative impacts on\nthe epidemic situation in Jordan.18-20 Also, the successive\npandemic waves have impacted the health system imposing a\nsigniﬁcant burden on healthcare institutions and the health\nworkforce in the country.18,21,22\nMany factors were linked to the severity and outcome of\nCOVID-19 among patients, and one of those factors was smoking.\nGlobally, tobacco use still represents a major threat to global public\nhealth with its proven effects in suppressing the immune system and\nincreasing the risk of various respiratory and cardiovascular\nillnesses.23-25 Also, tobacco use may lead to a vicious cycle of poverty\namong families with limited ﬁnancial resources.26,27 An yearly\nestimation of more than 8 million deaths occurs due to tobacco-\nrelated diseases, of which 1 million deaths are due to second-hand/\npassive smoking.26 It is essential to stress the point that the majority\nof smokers and tobacco-induced morbidity and mortality are found\nin low- and middle-income countries.25,26\nThe negative impacts of smoking on the respiratory and\nimmune systems and the linkage of smoking with the pro-\ngression of various pulmonary diseases are well addressed in the\nliterature.24,28 However, mixed epidemiological evidence has\ncharacterized the relationship between smoking and the\nprogression/severity of COVID-1928-30. Current epidemio-\nlogical evidence suggests that smoking is linked to the severity\nand progression of COVID-19,28,31 while other studies reported\nlower-than-expected risks of COVID-19 among smokers.32-35 A\nsystematic review by Vardavas et al29 reported a statistically\nsigniﬁcant association between smoking status and primary\nendpoints of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), ventilator\nuse, or death among COVID-19 patients. The review has shown\nthat smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms\nof COVID-19, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be\nadmitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die com-\npared to non-smokers. Also, another systematic review and meta-\nanalysis by Alqahtani et al36 reported that 22% of current smokers\nand 46% of ex-smokers in the studies included had severe\nCOVID-19 complications, and current smoking was associated\nwith a higher mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.\nMoreover, the physical, mental, and ﬁnancial impacts that\naccompanied the COVID-19 pandemic may exhibit an effect\non current smokers, including their smoking habits as well as\ntheir intention to quit smoking. For example, during the\npandemic in Turkey, smoking cessation rates have increased as\nreported in a study conducted by Tetik et al.37 This ﬁnding\n2\nTobacco Use Insights\nn\nn\nmight be as a result of the widespread fear that accompanied the\npandemic and the infection as it is primarily a respiratory illness,\ngiven the possibility that people who smoke will be at higher risk\nof COVID-19 or more prone to a worse outcome.\nRecent reports declared Jordan to be amongst the countries\nwith the highest rates of smoking in the EMR and the world with\nan average daily consumption of 23 cigarettes per male smoker,\nsurpassing the ﬁgures of Indonesia.22,38-40 Besides, Jordan was\nranked the sixth globally with a smoking prevalence of 70.2%\namong men and 10.7% among women.40 Jordan has an extensive\nanti-tobacco history that started in the 1970s.41 Despite the\nimmense efforts, the country is found to have high smoking rates\nrevealing an insufﬁcient anti-tobacco policy implementation and\nmonitoring.22 Moreover, the country has adopted the National\nTobacco Control Strategy for 2017-2019 with the more stringent\nimplementation of the WHO’s MPOWER package (Monitor,\nProtect, Offer help, Warn, Enforce and Raise taxes), aiming to\nreduce tobacco usage by 30% by 2025.42\nStudy Rationale and Aims\nThe COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality are ex-\npected to pose an impact on the attitudes of people toward\nsmoking during the pandemic crisis. Besides, the pandemic-\ninduced social, economic, and psychological impacts may affect\nsmoking-related\nbehaviors\nand\nattitudes\namong\ncurrent\nsmokers.43-46 On the other hand, this pandemic might en-\ncourage tobacco users to quit smoking considering the reported\nassociation between smoking and adverse outcomes of COVID-\n19 compared to non-smokers.46-48 Considering the importance\nof understanding people’s beliefs about smoking and its im-\nplications on developing targeted interventions and smoking\ncessation programs, and in the line with the previously de-\nscribed pandemic impacts, the linkage between smoking and\nCOVID-19, the high smoking rates in Jordan, and the paucity\nof studies that assessed this topic during the pandemic in the\nEMR, our current study aims were (i) to assess and explore the\nattitudes and beliefs that surround smoking/vaping and\nCOVID-19 and (ii) to assess the impacts of the pandemic on\nsmoking behaviors and quit plans/attempts, in a community-\nbased sample from Jordan.\nMethods and Materials\nStudy Setting\nOur current study was conducted in Jordan, a middle-income\ncountry located in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. According\nto the latest statistics, the population count of Jordan is about 10.8\nmillion.49 The ofﬁcial language of the country is Arabic.\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis study was a descriptive quantitative cross-sectional survey\nthat spanned from March 9, 2021, to March 16, 2021. Data\nwere collected utilizing an anonymous self-administered online\nquestionnaire that was developed using Google Form® (A se-\ncure cloud-based survey tool). The questionnaire was delivered\nin Arabic, the national language of Jordan. Considering the\ncontrol measures of the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, physical\ndistancing) and to reach participants from various regions in the\ncountry in a time-efﬁcient way, the decision was made by the\nresearch team to collect the data using a web-based (online)\nsurvey tool. We advertised our study on various social media\nforums including Facebook®, WhatsApp®, LinkedIn®, and\nTwitter®. Employing a snowball convenience sampling tech-\nnique, participants were recruited and further encouraged to\nshare the survey link with their family members and social\nnetwork.\nEligible participants should have been at least 18 years or\nolder, able to read and understand Arabic, and reside in Jordan.\nThe nature of our study, its objectives, and eligibility criteria for\nparticipation were explained in the introductory letter of our\nsurvey questionnaire. Participation was voluntarily and indi-\nviduals who were interested to get involved in the study have\ngiven online informed consent by declaring their eligibility and\naccepting to ﬁll out the questionnaire. There were no incentives/\nrewards upon participation.\nAssessment Tool and Measures\nA structured questionnaire was developed by the authors after\nreviewing relevant and related literature.30,46,48,50-59 The\nquestionnaire comprised 39 items that were distributed over\nthree sections as the following:\nSociodemographic, health, and smoking proﬁles. The ﬁrst section\nincluded 13 items that solicited data on the sociodemographic\nproﬁle, health proﬁle, and smoking proﬁle of participants. The\nsociodemographic data included age (in years), gender (female, male\nor prefer not to say), marital status (single or married), educational\nlevel (up to secondary school or higher education), residence area\n(rural or urban), employment status (unemployed, employed in the\nhealth sector, employed in non-health sector), and the number of\nhousehold members (less than 3 persons, 3-5 persons, or 6 persons\nand more).\nIn the health proﬁle, we asked the participants to report their\nphysical activity based on the WHO recommendation of\nwhether they maintain at least 150 minutes of moderate-\nintensity aerobic activity in a week (Yes or No), history of\nchronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory\ndiseases or any other chronic illnesses (Yes or No), history of\nlaboratory-conﬁrmed COVID-19 infection (Yes or No), and\nhistory of COVID-19 infection among family members in the same\nhouse (Yes or No).\nRegarding smoking proﬁle, participants were requested to\nreport their current smoking status (past 30-day use) regarding\ncombustible cigarettes (CCs), waterpipe (WP), and electronic\n3\nAl-Tammemi et al\nn\nn\ncigarettes (ECs) which are the most popular smoking methods\nin Jordan. Those who reported not using any of the above-\nmentioned products in the past 30 days were further asked to\nreport whether they never used any of the three products\n(classiﬁed as never-smokers) or if they previously used any of the\nproducts but had already quit (classiﬁed as ex-smokers). In our\nsurvey questionnaire, the participants were provided with a\ndetailed description of the deﬁnition of each smoking category\nto guarantee a complete understandability and correct reporting\nas well.\nBeliefs About Smoking and COVID-19. The second section of\nthe questionnaire included 14 items that aimed to assess the\nparticipants’ attitudes and beliefs surrounding various smoking\nmethods and COVID-19. The participants were instructed to\nanswer these items based on their beliefs and opinions. The 14\nitems of this section were adapted from a study after obtaining\nthe authors’ permission.30 The 14 items were distributed as the\nfollowing: three items on the relationship between smoking CC,\nWP, or EC and risk of contracting COVID-19 (related, not related\nor I do not know), three items on the safety of smoking CC, WP or\nEC inside the residence place during the pandemic crisis (safe, not\nsafe, I do not know), three items on the safety of smoking CC, WP\nor EC in public places during the pandemic crisis (safe, not safe, I\ndo not know), one item on the safety of EC as a substitute to any\nother form of smoking products during the pandemic (safe, not\nsafe, I do not know), three items on the general outcome of a CC,\nWP or EC smoker in case of contracting COVID-19 infection\n(similar to non-smokers, recover sooner, get worse). Lastly, the\nrespondents were asked whether they believe that smoking or\nnicotine use could provide protection against COVID-19 (Yes, No,\nor I do not know).\nSmoking Behavior and Quit Plans. The third section of our\nsurvey questionnaire assessed the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic on smoking behavior and quit attempts/plans through\n12 items that targeted both, current smokers, and ex-smokers\nwith six items for each. Current smokers were asked about how\nthe pandemic impacted their smoking habits in comparison to their\nhabits before the pandemic crisis (no change, increased con-\nsumption, decreased consumption, shifting to another smoking\nmethod, in an active quitting trial, or the initiation of smoking),\nand participants were requested to choose the most applicable\nscenario. Also, participants were asked if they consider/plan to quit\nsmoking during the pandemic (Yes, No), if they intend to use\nsmoking cessation tools (Yes, No), types of smoking cessation tools they\nintend to use (all that applies from: consulting a healthcare\nprovider, behavioral advice, Nicotine Replacement Therapy\n(NRT), medications or using EC), the primary motivation for\nplanning to quit smoking (COVID-19-related reasons, or reasons\nnot related to COVID-19), and the main driving reasons to quit\nsmoking due to COVID-19 (all that applies from: to protect myself,\nto protect my family, due to pandemic measures such as mask-\nwearing and closure of cafes or due to economic impacts/ﬁnancial\nconstraints induced by the pandemic). In the same section, ex-\nsmokers were asked to report if they have successfully quitted\nsmoking during COVID-19 or before the pandemic (yes, no), if their\nsuccessful quit attempts were due to COVID-19-related reasons or\nnot, the main driving reasons behind their decision to quit smoking\ndue to COVID-19 issues, their prospective plan concerning their\nsmoking cessation (sustaining it even after the pandemic is over, or\nresuming smoking after the pandemic is over), if they have used\nsmoking cessation tools (yes, no), and types of smoking cessation tools\nused (response choices were similar to those provided for current\nsmokers).\nFace/Content Validity and Pilot-Testing\nThe questionnaire was initially developed in English and eval-\nuated by two academics in the ﬁeld of tobacco research for\ncontent and face validity. Then, it was translated into Arabic by\ntwo independent academic translators using translation and back-\ntranslation techniques. To ensure clarity and understandability of\nthe questionnaire’s items among the general population, it was\npiloted on 50 participants from various academic and professional\nbackgrounds, and linguistic reﬁnements were made as needed\nbased on the feedback from the pilot-testing phase. The pilot\nresponses were not included in the ﬁnal analyses.\nData Management and Analyses\nCompleted responses were extracted from Google Form® as an\nExcel sheet for quality check, data cleaning, and coding. Then,\nthe Excel sheet was exported into Statistical Package for Social\nSciences version 24.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) for further\nstatistical analyses. Mean and standard deviation was used to\ndescribe numerical variables, while categorical variables were\nreported as frequency counts and percentages. Pearson’s chi\nsquare test was employed to assess signiﬁcant differences be-\ntween smoking groups (never-smokers, ex-smokers, and current\nsmokers) according to their sociodemographic proﬁle, health\nproﬁle, and beliefs surrounding smoking. Moreover, we esti-\nmated the adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) and 95% Conﬁdence\nInterval (95% CI) for smoking-related attitudes/beliefs using\nmultinomial logistic regression, with smoking status (never-\nsmokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers/reference) as a de-\npendent outcome variable, while adjusting for sociodemo-\ngraphic and health factors. A P <.05 was implemented for\nstatistical signiﬁcance.\nEthical Considerations\nThe protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the\ninstitutional review board at Applied Science Private University\nin Jordan (Ref. 2021-PHA-7). In addition, the study was\nconducted conforming to the ethical standards of the World\nMedical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The survey\nquestionnaire ensured the conﬁdentiality and anonymity of the\nstudy participants. Participation was voluntary and online\n4\nTobacco Use Insights\nn\nn\nwritten informed consent was obtained from all participants as a\npre-requisite before answering the survey items.\nResults\nSociodemographic, Health, and Smoking Proﬁle\nof Participants\nA total of 2424 participants have consented and responded to\nour survey questionnaire. The mean age of the overall cohort\nwas 35.2 years (SD: 11.06). Female participants slightly\npredominated the sample (n = 1256, 51.8%). Most partici-\npants were married (n = 1471, 60.7%), with college/university\neducation (n = 2164, 89.3%), employed in non-health sector\n(n = 949, 39.2%), living in urban areas (n = 2122, 87.5%), and\nresiding with three to ﬁve persons in the same living place (n =\n1398, 57.7%). Of the overall sample, 29.8% (n = 723) of the\nparticipants were found to practice sufﬁcient physical activity,\nwhile around 17.4% (n = 421) of participants reported having\na chronic disease. Those who got infected with COVID-19\ncomprised 27.5% (n = 666) of participants, and 35.9% (n =\n870) have reported at least one household member (living in\nthe same house) who suffered from COVID-19. Regarding\nsmoking status, around 48.0% (1163/2424), 8.9% (217/\n2424), and 43.1% (1044/2424) of participants were identi-\nﬁed to be never-smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers,\nrespectively. Additionally, of the total current smokers (n =\n1044), exclusive CC smokers comprised 566 (54.2%) par-\nticipants, while around 245 (23.5%), 98 (9.4%), and 135\n(12.9%) participants were found to be exclusive WP smokers,\nexclusive EC users, and dual/poly users (those who reported\nconcurrent use of at least two of the three products), re-\nspectively.

Never-smokers were more likely to believe that\nsmoking CC, WP, and EC are not safe inside residence places\nand in public places as well.\nMoreover, around 71.7% believed that CC smokers would\nhave a worse COVID-19 clinical course compared to those who\ndo not smoke, and this ﬁnding was closely similar to the beliefs\nsurrounding WP and EC usage. On the other hand, about one-\nquarter of respondents believed that smokers of CC, WP, or EC\nwould have the same COVID-19 clinical course as that for non-\nsmokers (23.0, 22.2, and 29.9%). Similarly, never-smokers were\nmore likely to believe that smoking CC, WP, or EC may worsen\nthe COVID-19 illness (see Figure 1 and Table 2).\nWhen we asked the participants about their beliefs toward EC\nas a substitute to other forms of smoking during the pandemic\ncrisis, more than half (54.3%) responded that EC is not a safer\noption according to their opinion. Besides, 74.1% of respondents\nbelieved that the use of tobacco products/nicotine does not\nprovide a protective effect against COVID-19, and instead, they\ncan worsen the disease course (see Figure 1 and Table 2).\nAttitudes and Beliefs Toward Smoking and COVID-19\nAmong Current Smokers Based on Smoking Products\n(n = 1044)\nAs previously described, our study sample comprised a total of\n1044 participants who were identiﬁed to be current smokers\nand were classiﬁed per smoking products as the following:\nexclusive CC smokers (n = 566), exclusive WP smokers (n =\n245), exclusive EC users (n = 98), and dual/poly users (n =\n135). Most exclusive CC smokers believed that smoking\ncigarettes is not associated with an increased risk of con-\ntracting COVID-19, while most of them believed the op-\nposite regarding WP smoking. Interestingly, most exclusive\nCC smokers, exclusive WP smokers, exclusive EC users, and\ndual/poly users believed that WP smoking is related to a\nhigher risk of spreading/contracting COVID-19. The same\napplies to the beliefs surrounding CC, WP, and EC use in public\nplaces, where most current smokers in the four smoking cate-\ngories believed that these smoking practices are not safe. Ex-\nceptionally, most EC users believed that using EC in the\nresidence place is a safe practice and considered a safer substitute\nto other tobacco products. Around 11.4% (n = 119) of current\nsmokers believed that tobacco/nicotine use may have a protective\neffect against COVID-19, and this belief was more prominent\namong exclusive CC smokers. Table 3 provides more details\nabout various beliefs surrounding smoking and COVID-19\namong current smokers, classiﬁed per smoking products.\nFindings of the Multinomial Regression Analysis\nAs described in the data analysis section, a multinomial re-\ngression analysis was employed to assess the adjusted odds ratio\n(AOR) and 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) of attitudes/\nbeliefs that surround smoking during the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic. The overall smoking status was treated as an outcome\nvariable with current smokers as a reference category while\nadjusting for sociodemographic and health factors.\nRegarding smoking and risk of COVID-19, the multinomial\nregression analysis revealed that never-smokers and ex-smokers\nwere less likely to believe that smoking CC is not related to the\nrisk of COVID-19 infection and spread (AOR=.48, 95% CI:\n.33-.69; and AOR=.57, 95% CI: .337-.964, respectively).

Regarding the\nuse of EC as a substitute to other forms of smoking during the\npandemic, never-smokers were less likely to believe that EC could\nbe a safer substitute (AOR=.53, 95% CI: 0.333-.830), and ex-\nsmokers were more likely to believe that EC use is not a safer\nsubstitute as well (AOR=1.70, 95% CI: 1.059-2.736) (see Table 4).\nImpacts of the Pandemic on Smoking Behavior and Quit\nPlans Among Current Smokers\nAmong current smokers (n = 1044), 42.4% (n = 443) have\nreported no change in their smoking behavior in general, while\naround 28.1% (n = 293) and 19.3% (n = 202) have reported\nincreased consumption, or reduced consumption, respectively.\nAlso, 2.6% (n = 27) and 1.2% (n = 13) reported shifting to\nanother smoking method, and initiation of smoking, respec-\ntively. Regarding quit plans, around 6.3% (n = 66) expressed\nbeing in current active trials to quit smoking. When current\nsmokers were asked if they have near-future plans/intention to\nquit smoking during the pandemic crisis (apart from those who\nwere in an active quitting trial), around 44.0% (n = 459) of\ncurrent smokers answered yes, of whom 152 participants cited\ntheir plans to use various smoking cessation tools with be-\nhavioral advice (45.4%) and using EC (48.0%) were the most\nreported items (see Figure 2). Besides, of the 459 current\nsmokers who expressed their plans to quit smoking during the\npandemic, around 27.5% (n = 126) conﬁrmed that the primary\ndriving force for their intention to quitting smoking is a\nCOVID-19-related issue, of which self-protection (n = 123)\nand protection of family members (=121) were the most re-\nported reasons, followed by pandemic measures such as\nmask-wearing and lockdowns (n = 63) and pandemic-induced\nﬁnancial constraints (n = 67).\nImpacts of the Pandemic on Successful Quitters\nOf the total number of ex-smokers who participated in our\nstudy (n = 217), 63 participants have reported their successful\nquit attempts during the pandemic crisis, while the rest were\nsuccessful quitters before the beginning of the pandemic. Of the\n63 successful quitters during the pandemic, only 12 have used\nsmoking cessation tools, mostly EC (see Figure 3).\nBesides, of the 63 successful quitters during the pandemic,\nonly 22 have reported that the main driving motivation of\ntheir successful quit attempts was COVID-19-related issue,\nwith self-protection and protection of family members were\nthe most frequent reasons (n = 22 and n = 20, respectively),\nfollowed by pandemic measures such as mask-wearing and\nlockdowns (n = 9) and pandemic-induced ﬁnancial con-\nstraints (n = 6).

Of the overall cohort, around 38.2%, 72.9%,\nand 44.6% of the participants believed that CC, WP, and EC\nare related to the risk of contracting COVID-19, with WP\nsmoking being on the top of the list.\nWP smoking is highly prevalent worldwide and in the\nWHO EMR.60-62 The popularity of WP smoking is possibly\ngrounded in the attractiveness of ﬂavored WP tobacco\n(Moassel or Maassel), the usability of WP devices in smoking\nillicit drugs like Cannabis/Marijuana, and the social impli-\ncations as this smoking method is prominent in social gath-\nerings. Also, WP smoking is widely spread among young\nadults and youths in Arab states, where most caf´es and res-\ntaurants provide WP service, and many individuals own a WP\ndevice at home. In general, the possibility of transmitting\nvarious infectious microbial agents through waterpipe usage is\nhigh, especially in caf´es where cleaning and washing of WP\ndevices after each customer’s use is not feasible, and where\nsharing the same WP device with multiple users is also\ncommon practice.60 Bacterial, viral and fungal microbes were\nreported in the literature to be transmitted to users through\nWP devices, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter\npylori, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex\nvirus, respiratory viruses, and even respiratory fungal patho-\ngens (eg, Aspergillus).60,63-68 These facts about WP and the\nassociated infectious risks have forced many countries to en-\nforce a ban on the use of WP in public places during the\npandemic.69\nAdditionally, a notable proportion of participants believed\nthat various smoking methods (CC, WP, and EC) are not safe\nto be used inside the residence place, with closely similar\nﬁndings regarding their usage in public places as well. However,\nWP received the highest safety concerns among the respon-\ndents. Besides, most participants (71.7%) expressed that that\nbeing a CC smoker may worsen the COVID-19 clinical course\ncompared to those who do not smoke, with closely similar\nconcerns surrounding WP (74.1%) and EC (66.7%) usage.\nSeveral recent studies addressed an association between\nsmoking and the severity of COVID-19. Reddy et al70 re-\nported in their systematic review and meta-analysis that\ncurrent smokers had an increased risk of severe and critical\nCOVID-19 with risk ratios of 1.80, and 1.98, respectively.70\nThey also found that COVID-19 patients with a smoking\nhistory had an increased risk for severe or critical COVID-19,\nin-hospital mortality, disease progression, and need for me-\nchanical ventilation.70\nOn the contrary, a large-scale ecological study across 38\nEuropean countries that aimed to examine different factors\nassociated with the number of COVID-19 cases per million\npeople at a speciﬁc time-point revealed a signiﬁcant negative\nrelationship between the prevalence of smoking among the\nadult population and COVID-19 cases.54 In line with this\nﬁnding, a systematic review by Farsalinos et al32 that examined\nthe\nprevalence\nof\ncurrent\nsmoking\namong\nhospitalized\nCOVID-19 patients in China, found a surprisingly low\nsmoking prevalence among those patients, and this could be\nhypothetically linked to the immunomodulatory effect of nic-\notine.32 However, this ﬁnding was criticized to have numerous\nbiases.71 In our study, 74.1% of respondents believed that the\nuse of tobacco products/nicotine does not provide a protective\neffect against COVID-19, and instead, they believed that\ntobacco/nicotine may have a negative consequence on the\nclinical outcome of COVID-19. Never-smokers and ex-\nsmokers were more likely to have this belief compared to\ncurrent smokers in our study.\nMoreover, EC as a novel smoking method is gaining\npopularity worldwide due to its appealing ﬂavors and the\ncommercial claims of their beneﬁts as a smoking cessation tool,\ndespite the controversial scientiﬁc evidence.72-75 In Jordan,\nEC use is increasing as the government has recently legalized\nthe importation, distribution, and sale of EC in various retail\nstores in the country.72,74,76 In a national survey that was\nconducted in 2019 in Jordan, and among the 1820 participants\ninvolved, the prevalence of exclusive EC use and dual-use was\nestimated to be 11.7%, and 4.0%, respectively.77 Another\nrecent online cross-sectional survey in Jordan that included\n1536 participants found that around 18% of the study sample\nwere EC users, and its usage was more prominent among\nmales and young age groups.78 In our study, 54.3% of par-\nticipants reported their belief that EC is not a safe option to\nreplace combustible tobacco products during the pandemic\ncrisis, while around 13.8% believed EC is a safer option\ncompared to WP or CC. Most believers in EC safety were\ncurrent smokers. These EC-related beliefs may have been\nimpacted by the pandemic crisis, and this was explored by a\nmixed-method study that was carried out in the United\nStates.56 Among these impacts were the perceived COVID-19\nhealth risks that may be related to the inhaled toxic substances\nfound in EC vapor and their effects on the lungs.\nConcerning our study’s second aim, the majority of current\nsmokers (57.6%, 601/1044) have reported a change in their\nsmoking habits during the pandemic crisis. Most participants\nreported an increased consumption or reduced consumption.\nIncreased tobacco use during the pandemic has been also re-\nported in recent studies.50,53,55 Besides, many current smokers\nin our study have reported their intention to quit smoking\nduring the pandemic, which was also one of the ﬁndings of\nvarious studies\nduring the pandemic crisis.48,55 Various\nCOVID-19-related reasons were cited by quit planners during\nthe pandemic (among current smokers) and successful quitters\nduring the pandemic (among ex-smokers). These reasons may\nreﬂect the profound effects of the pandemic crisis on individual’s\nlifestyles and habits. Additionally, most successful quitters due\nto COVID-19 in our study have reported their willingness to\nsustain smoking cessation after the pandemic is over, which is\nalso in line with the ﬁndings of a study that was conducted in\nIran.30\n11\nAl-Tammemi et al\nn\nn\nTable 4.

Various beliefs have surrounded smoking in its most\ncommon forms in the country, namely, combustible cigarettes,\nwaterpipe, and electronic cigarettes. Despite the controversial\nevidence about the effect of smoking on COVID-19 during the\nearly stages of the pandemic crisis, most recent studies pointed to\na signiﬁcant connection between smoking and the risk of\nCOVID-19 progression, hospitalization, and mortality. In Jor-\ndan, a country that is ranked the sixth globally in the smoking\nrate, where anti-smoking policies are present but weakly\nenforced, where smoking has socio-cultural inﬂuences, and\nwhere tobacco industry front groups have signiﬁcant inter-\nference in tobacco policymaking in the country, it is im-\nperative to take the beneﬁt of the pandemic crisis to advocate\nmore stringent implementation of anti-tobacco measures in\nthe community. Also, it is crucial to raise community\nawareness about the dangers of smoking in general and in\nrelation to the COVID-19 utilizing mass media messages\nand to encourage smoking cessation using scientiﬁcally valid\nquitting tools. Although the pandemic may encourage cur-\nrent smokers to reduce their consumption or to quit, there is a\npossibility for the opposite scenario where pandemic-induced\nstress may lead to increased smoking,53 or even initiation of\nsmoking which was noticed among few participants in our\nstudy. Therefore, public health decision-makers should be\naware of the double-edged effect of the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic on tobacco use, and appropriate measures should be\ntaken to prevent further escalation of smoking rates in Jordan,\nconsidering the severe economic and psychological impacts\nthat afﬂicted most people in the country.\nOur study has limitations that should be considered when\ninterpreting the results.

Current smoking was treated a Reference category of the outcome variable, and statistically signiﬁcant\nresults are marked with asterisk (P<.05). The regression model was adjusted for both sociodemographic variables (age, gender, marital status, education, living place, and\nnumber of household members) and health status variables (physical activity, chronic diseases, and COVID-19 status). Only the results covering beliefs toward smoking are\nreported in this table.\n13\nAl-Tammemi et al\nn\nn\nprobability sampling that may limit the generalizability of our\nﬁndings, (ii) using an online survey which also impacts the\nrepresentatives of the study sample as this tool targets people\nwith sufﬁcient level of digital literacy and access to the internet,\n(iii) the cross-sectional nature of our study in which exploring\ncause–effect relationship is not feasible, (iv) the study was\nlimited to Arabic-speaking individuals in Jordan, and lastly,\nand (v) our questionnaire items represented self-reporting\nstates; thus, recall bias might have an effect on the results.\nNevertheless, we encourage nationally representative longi-\ntudinal studies to assess the dynamicity of these beliefs,\nsmoking behaviors, and successful quit attempts among those\nwho have a willingness to cease smoking.\nConclusions\nA signiﬁcant proportion of participants have reported anti-\nsmoking attitudes toward certain smoking methods while a\nminority did not have a conclusive attitude/belief. Besides, our\nstudy ﬁndings suggest that the pandemic crisis may impact the\nsmoking habits of current smokers and may encourage smokers\nto consider smoking cessation. Nevertheless, given that the data\nwere collected cross-sectionally, and only during the pandemic,\nthe true impact of the pandemic on smoking behaviors is not\npossible to gauge, and longitudinal studies are needed. Addi-\ntionally, considering the dynamicity of human health behaviors,\na large-scale event like the current COVID-19 pandemic may\nexhibit signiﬁcant effects that lead to adopting risky behaviors\nFigure 2.

Reliable anti-smoking actions and\nmeasures should be implemented and maintained especially in\ncontexts where smoking prevalence is high and stressful events\nare prominent as these events may act as a spark for stress-\ninduced smoking.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors provide their sincere thanks and appreciation to all\nstudy participants for completing the survey questionnaire.\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization: ABA, MB, and LRK; supervision: LRK;\nmethodology: ABA, MB, and LRK; data collection: ABA,\nMB, DA, SAA, DMA, GMK, KAN, FWF, RMJ, MK, and\nAA; data analysis and interpretation: ABA; literature review:\nABA, MB, HOA, AAb, BO, ZT, HO, and MAA; writing—\noriginal draft preparation: ABA ; and writing—critical review\nand editing: ABA, MAA, and LRK.

This\nfact has been demonstrated by the seminal study of Leung et al [3], and\nthen confirmed by the preliminary investigation of Smith and Sheltzer\n[4].\nNevertheless, accumulating biological and clinical evidence sug-\ngests also that the relationship between active smoking and COVID-19\nis not straightforward or unidirectional, and contributes to portray this\nintricate link as a double-edged sword, so that drawing definitive\nconclusions may be premature and even misleading, as we emphasized\nin our previous article [2]. On the one hand, whether cigarette\nsmoking-induced up-regulation of the natural SARS-CoV-2 receptor\nACE2 in human cells would increase the likelihood of being infected\nmust be considered. However, to the contrary, increased expression of\nthis enzyme may considerably attenuate the risk of developing the\ndevastating lung and systemic injuries characterizing severe and critical\nforms of COVID-19 (Fig. 1). ACE2 plays a pivotal role in the patho-\ngenesis of pulmonary disease and its evolution towards respiratory\ndistress, whereby this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II\n(AngII) into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), a degradation peptide which\nstrongly counteracts the unfavorable pro-inflammatory, vasoconstric-\ntive, oxidative and fibrotic activity of the parental hormone AngII [5].\nAngII levels have been shown to be elevated in COVID-19, correlating\nwith lung injury. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that en-\nhanced expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of the lungs and other\norgans would cumulatively lower the risk of AngII-mediated tissue in-\njury.\nThis hypothesis finds some reliable epidemiological ground in a\nlarge report by Petrilli et al [6], showing that the prevalence of COVID-\n19 in tobacco users was significantly higher among patients with no\ncritical COVID-19 illness who could be discharged than in COVID-19\npatients who were instead classified as having severe disease (6.7% vs.\n4.3%). Overall, this would translate into the evidence that current\ntobacco users have a nearly 40% lower risk of progressing towards\ncritical COVID-19 illness (odds ratio (OR), 0.63; 95% confidence in-\nterval (95%CI), 0.40-1.00). Moreover, in multivariate logistic regres-\nsion, tobacco use (former and current) was associated with reduced risk\nof hospitalization (OR, 0.71; 95%CI, 0.57-0.87). Importantly, recent\ndata on approximately 1,500 US patients hospitalized for COVID-19\npublished by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nCOVID-19 Response Team also shows that current smoking may be\nassociated with a non-significant trend toward decreased disease se-\nverity [7], whereby the percentage of current smokers was found to be\nnearly half in patients needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission than\nin those who do not (1.1% vs. 2.2%; odds ratio 0.51; 95% CI, 0.19-\n1.36).\nIndirect evidence of potential benefits from increasing ACE2 ex-\npression for ameliorating the prognosis of COVID-19 has then emerged\nfrom studies showing that recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is effective to\nrapidly decrease Ang II and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels, thus mitigating\nthe pro-inflammatory milieu that is commonplace in patients with\nacute respiratory distress syndrome [8]. Additionally, interesting evi-\ndence has been published in the study of Monteil et al, who experi-\nmentally showed that not only could SARS-CoV-2 infection of human\nblood vessels and kidney organoids be efficiently inhibited by rhACE2,\nbut the administration of this recombinant enzyme could also decrease\nviral load by a factor between 1,000–5,000 [9].\nIn conclusion, far be it from recommending cigarette smoking to\nprevent evolution into severe or critical forms of COVID-19, since the\nmany and multifaceted unhealthy effects of cigarette smoking are well\nestablished [10], we endorse the suggestion of Garufi et al [1], that\nadditional prospective studies and collaborative efforts are needed to\nclarify the complex relationship between smoking and COVID-19\n(Fig. 1).\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nAll authors have no actual or potential conflict of interest including\nany financial, personal or other relationships with other people or or-\nganizations within three years of beginning the submitted work that\ncould inappropriately influence, or be perceived to influence, their\nwork.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.060\nReceived 22 April 2020; Accepted 28 April 2020\nEuropean Journal of Internal Medicine 77 (2020) 123–124\nAvailable online 01 May 2020\n0953-6205/ © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

However, once infected an increased risk of severe disease is \nreported. We investigated the association between smoking and COVID-19 during an outbreak of \nthe disease on a naval vessel.\nMethods:  We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on the 1769 sailors of the same \nnavy aircraft carrier at sea exposed at the same time to SARS-CoV2 to investigate the link between \ntobacco consumption and Covid-19.\nResults:  Among the 1688 crewmembers (87% men; median age = 28 [interquartile range 23–35]) \nincluded, 1279 (76%) developed Covid-19 (1038 [62%] reverse-transcriptase- polymerase chain re-\naction testing–positive and 241 [14%] with only clinical signs). One hundred and seven patients \nwere hospitalized. The univariable analysis odds ratio (OR) for Covid-19 infection was 0.59 (95% \nconfidence interval [CI], 0.45–0.78; p < .001) for current smokers versus former and nonsmokers; \nsex, body mass index or blood group had no significant impact. Crewmembers >50 years old had \nan increased risk of contracting Covid-19 (OR, 2.84 [95% CI, 1.30–7.5]; p = .01). Multivariable ana-\nlysis retained the lower risk of current smokers becoming infected (OR, 0.64 [0.49–0.84]; p < .001) \nand age >50 years was significatively associated with Covid-19 (OR, 2.6 [1.17–6.9]; p = .03).\nConclusions:  Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but \ncannot be considered as efficient protection against infection. The mechanism of the lower suscep-\ntibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research.\nTrial Registration:  IRB no.: 0011873-2020-09\nImplications:  (1) Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and COVID-\n19.

This finding strongly supports the need for fur-\nther research on nicotine physiological pathway and its impact on COVID-19 infection whilst empha-\nsizing that tobacco smoking should not be considered as efficient protection against COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nRecent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between \nsmoking and becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. Smoking seems \nto lower the susceptibility to infection1–11 but increases the risk of \ndeveloping severe disease.1–3,7,8\nRegarding Covid-19 severity, a recent systematic review of five \nstudies on SARS-CoV-2–infected patients found smokers had rela-\ntive risks of 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–2.00) to de-\nvelop severe Covid-19 and 2.4 (95% CI 1.43–4.04) for intensive \ncare unit (ICU) admission.4 Among 8910 patients hospitalized for \nCovid-19 (low smoking rate, 6% smokers), Mehra et al. observed \na greater risk of death for current smokers than nonsmokers or \nformer smokers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.29–\n2.47]).5 However, recent results indicated very low rates of smoking \namong hospitalized Covid-19 patients in China, the United States, \nand France.4,6–10 For example, the Centers for Disease Control sum-\nmary of all confirmed Covid-19 cases until March 28, 2020 in the \nUnited States reported that only 1.3% were current smokers and \n2.3% former smokers. This compares to 13.4% adult smoking \nprevalence in the United States which reaches 19.4% when including \ne-cigarette users.11 However, studies reporting a low rate of smoking \nhave been criticized for the poor quality and retrospective collec-\ntion of smoking status data, the comparison of smoking of subjects \nCovid-19 to smoking of the general population sometimes without \ntaking into account sex and age1,3,5,7–9 and for having included only \nsymptomatic or in-hospital subjects, creating possible selection \nbias.1,3,5,7–10 In this context, it is important to further explore the rela-\ntionships between smoking and Covid-19, and to determine whether \nthese relationships could reflect an effect of nicotine or smoke itself. \nIt is also necessary to determine whether lower infection rates among \nsmokers reflects infection prevention or an increase of asymptomatic \nor mild forms (not seeking medical assistance), which would affect \ncollective immunity because a higher rate of asymptomatic patients \ncould increase the virus spread.\nA COVID-19 outbreak occurred in April 2020 on the French \nNavy nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which was carrying \n1769 crew members. During the mission, the crewmembers were \ncontained onboard without mixing with other populations and, \nthus, were exposed at the same time and in the same place to SARS-\nCoV-2. When the ship returned to France, the entire crew was locked \ndown at different military bases and benefited from daily medical \nmonitoring for 14  days after landing. This study was undertaken \nwith the main objective was to investigate the possible relationship \nbetween tobacco consumption and SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this \nparticular and well-defined population and conditions of exposure.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight and Design\nTo investigate the effect of smoking on developing Covid-19, we \nconducted this observational study on a retrospective cohort com-\nprised of the aircraft carrier’s crew. The local Institutional Ethics \nCommittee approved the study (IRB no.: 0011873-2020-09). All \ndata were collected in the context of care from completely anonym-\nized files, in accordance with French and European laws, including \nthe General Data Protection Regulation. All patients were informed \nand provided written consent to use their data.\nPopulation Screening and Data Collection\nThe aircraft carrier was deployed at sea from January 22 to April 13, \nas part of an operational mission. A SARS-COV-2 epidemic broke \nout on-ship, requiring its early (2 weeks) return to Toulon (main \nharbor of the ship). All 1769 persons onboard underwent a physical \nexamination, with reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction \ntesting (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal samples obtained immediately \nupon arrival in Toulon. All crew members were individually housed \nduring confinement (for 14 days and at least 2 days after symptoms \ndisappeared), patients with clinical signs and/or PCR-positive were \nisolated in a given area and asymptomatic PCR-negative subjects in \nanother. During this period vital signs (eg, fever, respiratory symp-\ntoms) were monitored daily by the medical teams of the French \nArmy Health Service (Service de Santé des Armées). During medical \nmonitoring, all crewmembers completed an information question-\nnaire on their smoking habits (Appendix) under the supervision of \nan investigator.\nDefinitions and Data Collected\nSARS-CoV-2-infected subjects (cases) were defined as RT-PCR-\npositive (confirmed) or patients with clinical symptoms highly sug-\ngestive of Covid-19 (fever, myalgias, arthralgias, dyspnea, cough, \nheadache, anosmia, ageusia, rhinitis, diarrhea, fatigue, cutaneous \nsigns) (suspected). Non-Covid-19 participants had no clinical signs \nand were RT-PCR-negative. The questionnaire on smoking status \nspecifically asked about current tobacco consumption and frequency \nand intensity of current smoking (daily or occasional smoking, \nnumber of daily cigarettes). Crewmembers were considered current \nsmokers when they had smoked (any type of products including \ne-cigarette and shisha) during the last 3  months (daily or not). \nFormer smokers included anyone who had smoked (any tobacco \nproduct corresponding to >100 cigarettes during their whole life) \nin the past and had abstained from smoking for at least the pre-\nceding 3 months. “Never smokers” had smoked <100 cigarettes in \ntheir whole lifetime. E-cigarette vaping was also recorded, as was \nthe use of nicotinic replacement therapy or other smoking-cessation \ntreatments (eg, varenicline).\nIn addition to smoking status, the following medical informa-\ntion was extracted from medical records: age, sex, height, weight, \nblood group, Covid-19–related symptoms and their duration, the in-\ndication of hospitalization, and whether or not a Chest Tomography \nscan (CT) was done.\nRNA Extraction and Real-Time RT-PCR Assay\nTotal RNAs were extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab sam-\nples of all crewmembers, and 200 μL of the sample were subjected \nto thermal and chemical inactivation and RNA extraction with \nMagnapure (Roche Diagnostic, Basel, Switzerland) or Genoxtract \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/23/8/1398/6073671 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1400\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2021, Vol. 23, No. 8\n(Biocentric, Bandol, France). The RT-PCR assay was run according \nto the French National Center protocol, targeting IP2 and IP4 re-\ngions of the SARS-CoV-2–specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase \n(RdRp) gene on Light Cyler 480 (Lightcycler 480, Roche, Basel, \nSwitzerland).\nStatistical Analyses\nThe primary analysis investigated the impact of smoking status \non the risk of developing Covid-19 (symptoms and/or positive \nRT-PCR). Secondary analyses were the risk evaluations for con-\nfirmed Covid-19 (RT-PCR–positive) being symptomatic, for the \nimpact of age, sex, blood group or body mass index (BMI) on the \nrisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, for the impact of smoking habits \n(cigarette, e-cigarette, shisha, etc.) on developing Covid-19, and the \ninitial clinical picture of Covid-19. A descriptive analysis was first \nconducted. Dichotomous variables are expressed as numbers (per-\ncentages) with 95% CI, and continuous variables as means or me-\ndians with range, 95% CI, and/or interquartile range (IQR). Age and \nBMI were grouped into categories (age <20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, \nand >50 years; BMI <20, 20–25, 25–30, and >30 kg/m2). Then, after \nverifying the conditions of use, categorical variables were compared \nin univariable analyses (chi2 test) and the means of continuous vari-\nables with the Student’s t test.\nLastly, the impact of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility was \nevaluated using logistic-regression univariable and multivariable \nanalyses (risks assessed by ORs). The multivariable model included \nas covariates some parameters of clinical interest (age, sex, and \nBMI); the parameter “blood group” was only integrated when the \nunivariate p-value was <.2. All analyses were computed with R soft-\nware, version 3.6.3.12 p < .05 defined statistical significance.\nResults\nPatients\nOf the 1769 crew members on the ship, 1688 (95%) were included \nin this study (59 withdrew consent and 22 had missing data: most \nof them had left the ship because of specific duty). The flow chart \n(Figure 1) shows the pathways and distribution of Covid-19 diag-\nnoses. The demographic and clinical characteristics of all partici-\npants and Covid-19 status are reported in Table 1. Their median \nage was 28 years and 13% of the crew members were women. The \npopulation appeared to be healthy, with a median BMI of 24 and no \nsignificant co-morbidities. Notably, 48% were current smokers, with \nmean consumption of 9.7 cigarettes per day (95% CI, 9.7–10.15), \n23% were former smokers (who had quit before January 2020) and \n29% were never smokers. Among the 249 e-cigarettes users, two \nwere exclusive users, 247 were dual users who simultaneously used \ne-cigarettes and smoked tobacco; 78 had smoked shisha between \nJanuary and March 2020. The most frequent blood group was O \n(45%) followed by A (40%), with only 11% B and 4% AB.\nCovid-19\nWhile onboard, 1279 patients developed Covid-19, representing a \n76% (1279/1688) infection-attack rate. RT-PCR confirmed SARS-\nCoV-2 infection among 1038 (62%) patients, and 241 (14%) \ncases were clinically diagnosed. After returning to France, 107 \ncrewmembers were hospitalized, including three requiring ICU ad-\nmission. Covid-19 was asymptomatic in 172 (14%) cases. Among \nsymptomatic cases, the mean duration of symptoms was 9  days \n(range, 1–40; 95% CI, 9.08–9.88). Table 2 gives the frequencies \nof patient-reported symptoms. The most common were headache \n(52%), ageusia, anosmia (48%), and fatigue (45%), with cough or \ndyspnea representing 22% and 34%, respectively; only 25% had \na fever.\nMain Outcome\nThe rate of Covid-19 infection in the groups of current smokers, \nformer smokers, and never smokers was respectively 71% (579/815), \n80% (309/386), and 80% (391/487). Among Covid-19 patients, \n45% (579/1279) were current smokers versus 58% (236/409) in the \nnon-Covid-19 group (Table 1).\nAccording to univariable analyses, current smoking was sig-\nnificantly associated with Covid-19 compared to former and \nnonsmokers and subjects >50 years old were at significantly higher \nrisk of catching Covid-19 (Table 3). No significant relationship was \nfound between SARS-CoV-2 infection and sex, BMI, or blood group. \nMultivariable analysis retained the significantly lower risk of SARS-\nCoV-2 infection for current smokers and age >50 years remained sig-\nnificantly associated with Covid-19. A similar result was found when \ncases were restricted to PCR positive patients (OR 0.57 [0.44–0.72]).\nSecondary Outcomes\nSmoking status did not delay Covid-19 onset, as new symptomatic in-\nfections peaked between April 6 and 8 for smokers and nonsmokers. \nThe Covid-19-case rate was not significantly different for e-cig users \n(OR, 0.75 [95% CI 0.54–1.05]; p = .1) or shisha smokers (OR, 0.92 \n[95% CI 0.54–1.55]; p = .79).\nAmong current smokers (807 patients), compared to the group \nof patients who didn’t smoke everyday (166 patients), we found an \nOR for Covid-19 0.62 [95% CI 0.39–0.94]; p = .003 for smokers \n<10 cigarettes/day (373 patients) and 0.33 [95% CI 0.19–0.55]; p \n<.0001 for smokers > 10 cigarettes/day (123 patients).\nAmong 107 hospitalized Covid-19 cases, 31 were current \nsmokers and 76 former or nonsmokers (p = .09). Among the 20 \ncases requiring oxygen therapy, two were current smokers (OR, 0.16 \n[95% CI 0.02–0.69]; p = .005). Smoking was not associated with a \nhigher number of clinical signs (OR, 0.80 [95% CI 0.55–1.12]; p = \n.20) in the RT-PCR positive subgroup. Among Covid-19 patients, \ncurrent smoking was associated with less frequent fever >38°C, dys-\npnea, coughing, myalgias, diarrheas, and headache.

The outbreak affected 76% of the crew. Most \ncases were mild forms, with only 107 (6%) patients hospitalized, \nincluding three in ICU; none died. The SARS-CoV-2-infection \nrate observed herein was much higher than that on the Diamond \nPrincess ocean liner (700/3700, 18.9%) or the Roosevelt aircraft \ncarrier (1100/4800, 22.3%),13,14 but those investigations only took \ninto account, RT-PCR-positive patients. Our RT-PCR positive \nCovid-19-case rate was 61.5% (1038/1688 patients). The prox-\nimity of crew is far greater on an aircraft carrier than for passen-\ngers on a cruise ship and could partly explain the rapid progression \nof the outbreak. A  more detailed epidemiologic investigation is \nunderway to try to understand these differences. Aboard ship, \nsmoking is only allowed in two limited areas and crewmembers \nare not allowed to smoke at their workstations.

There are many interactions on-board: at workplaces, \nrelaxation areas, or mess halls. Because sleeping berths were as-\nsigned by the command and not by affinity, we thought it unneces-\nsary to look for a “subgroup effect.” Smoking did not change the \ndate of symptom onset. Further studies are needed to describe \nand compare the degree of social interactions among smokers and \nnonsmokers.\nOur findings suggest that current smoking appears to signifi-\ncantly lower the odds of Covid-19 occurrence by –36% compared \nto nonsmokers and former smokers. However, the odds ratio will \nover-estimate the strength of the relative risk reduction (particu-\nlarly as the prevalence of the outcome was high). Univariable and \nmultivariable analyses identified and retained, respectively, that sig-\nnificant independent association (Table 3), as well as age >50 years. \nWe found no significant association between Covid-19 and BMI, \nsex, or blood group. The Covid-19 clinical picture also appeared \nto differ according to smoking status, with fewer general symptoms \n(fever, asthenia, and headache) and respiratory signs (cough and dys-\npnea) among current smokers and some evidence of less severe in-\nfections—for example, among 20 patients requiring oxygen therapy, \nonly two were current smokers, Previous studies showed conflicting \nresults with most studies finding higher levels of severe Covid-19 in \nsmokers (usually older and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n[COPD] patients).15 As the numbers with severe disease in our study \nwere low, these results need to be treated with caution\nThe mechanism of interaction between smoking and SARS-\nCoV-2 infection remains unknown. Nicotine could be responsible for \nthe effect,16–24 as well as tobacco smoke by for example its fine par-\nticles and numerous chemical agents which could have a nonspecific \neffect of worsening of all viral related lung diseases.25 The ACE2 \nreceptor is the site of specific binding to the cell of SARS-CoV-1 \nand SARS-CoV-2,16–19 but not of Middle-East respiratory syndrome \n(MERS)-CoV (dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPP4] is involved).22 In \nMERS-CoV-related disease, nonspecific tobacco-related worsening \nof viral diseases had been reported, but no clinical protective effect. \nThe ACE2 receptor hypothesis has been strongly advocated, but re-\ncent studies,18,19 in contradiction with older data,24 suggest a greater \nexpression of these receptors in smokers. This would be expected \nto result in an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV2 infection \nin smokers, as well as in women who have more ACE2 receptors \nthan men. Neither of these is observed. Two other hypotheses have \nbeen proposed, but actually, none of them give a global explan-\nation for the lower rate of Covid-19 in smokers: the first hypothesis \nsupposes a global effect on the renin-angiotensin system of which \nACE2 is only part of, by up-regulating the ACE1 receptor and down-\nregulating the ACE2 receptor.24 The second hypothesis involves an \ninteraction between ACE2 and the nicotinic receptors (in particular \nα7 nicotine receptors), which is very close on the cell membrane to \nthe ACE2 receptors and whose dysregulation could trigger a Th1 \nimmune response.16 Nicotin and SARS-Cov2 could also compete for \nbinding to nAchR.16,17\nThe key strength of this study is that virtually the whole popula-\ntion was included, so smoking type did not affect the likelihood of \nbeing tested for Covid-19 (no selection bias). We were also able to \ninvestigate dose-response in relation to current intensity of smoking.\nThe generalizability of these findings of this study is uncer-\ntain. For example, results from this young and healthy popu-\nlation may not apply in a more to the general (older and with \nmore co-morbidities) population. However, our findings broadly \nalign with previously identified risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 in-\nfection or protection against Covid-19 (age and smoking status). \nThe clinical presentation of cases was also consistent with current \nliterature.\nTable 3.  Univariable and Multivariable Analyses of Factors Associated with COVID-19\nFactor\nUnivariable analysis\nMultivariable analysis\nOR (95% CI)\np-value\naOR (95% CI)\np-value\nAge—years\n<.0001\n  <20\n0.98 (0.61–1.63)\n.94\n0.99\nNS\n  20–30\n1.00\n—\n1.00\n—\n  30–40\n1.01 (0.78–1.31)\n.93\n1.00\nNS\n  0–50\n1.42 (0.77–2.12)\n.07\n1.30\nNS\n  >50\n2.84 (1.30–7.5)\n.01\n2.6 (1.17–6.9)\n.03\nSex\n.83\nNS\n  Male\n1.00\n—\n1.00\n—\n  Female\n0.96 (0.70–1.35)\n—\n1.00\n—\nBody mass index\n  <20\n0.68 (0.42–1.13)\n.13\n0.70\nNS\n  20–25\n1.00\n—\n1.00\n—\n  25–30\n0.93 (0.73–1.20)\n.60\n0.90\nNS\n  >30\n0.71 (0.44–1.18)\n.18\n0.69\nNS\nTobacco\n  Never smoker\n1.00\n—\n1.00\n—\n  Former smoker\n0.98 (0.70–1.38)\n.93\n0.98\nNS\n  Active smoker\n0.59 (0.45–0.78)\n<0.001\n0.64 (0.49–0.84)\n.001\nBlood group\n  O\n0.86 (0.67–1.10)\n.22\nNA\n—\n  A\n1.00\n—\nNA\n—\n  B\n0.82 (0.57–1.21)\n.31\nNA\n—\n  AB\n0.99 (0.56–1.83)\n.97\nNA\n—\nOR, odds ratio; aOR, adjusted OR; NS, nonsignificant; NA, not applicable.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/23/8/1398/6073671 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1403\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2021, Vol. 23, No. 8\nWe were unable to account for the impact of onboard lifestyle \nor the degree of social interactions on the spread of the infection \nbecause this is the subject of a more extensive epidemiologic inves-\ntigation still in progress. This could potentially be a confounding \nfactor, if, for example, smokers have a lower degree of interaction \nwith other crew members. However, we found that all areas of the \nship were affected, which is consistent with the very confined space \non board. It is therefore unlikely that taking this factor into account \nwould modify the results on the impact of smoking.\nThe retrospective nature of the study is also a limitation, al-\nthough the study was conducted when the outbreak was still in \nprogress when all the crewmembers were still gathered. We paid \nparticular attention to the reliability of the information collected by \nassigning medical staff to data collection. A tobacco consumption \nrate of 50% in the French Navy was reported previously, thus our \ndata are consistent.26\nThe quantification of smoking was difficult because most very \nyoung patients had been smoking for a short time and very ir-\nregularly, with notable differences between onboard and on-shore \nperiods. So we were unable to assess dose-response in relation to \npack years of smoking. Given the fact that only two patients were \nexclusive e-cigarette smokers, no conclusion can be drawn con-\ncerning the association between vaping and Covid-19 infection.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study support, in accordance with some pre-\nvious findings, that smoking is associated with a lower suscep-\ntibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, 71% of smokers \ndeveloped Covid-19, so it seems unreasonable to say that smoking \nstrongly protects against Covid-19 infection in this population. \nThe finding of a lower odds of infection among smokers and the \ntrend towards a lower risk among e-cigarettes users, although \nnot significant, encourages further research on nicotine’s physio-\nlogic pathway. Further studies also have to be conducted to spe-\ncify mechanisms that could underlie this relationship, particularly \nsocializing habits and smoker’s lifestyles, which could affect \ninterhuman SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, any hypothet-\nical “protective” effect of smoking has to be put in context with \nthe high tobacco burden worldwide. Smoking certainly should not \nbe recommended as a public health measure.\nSupplementary Material\nA Contributorship Form detailing each author’s specific involvement with this \ncontent, as well as any supplementary data, are available online at https://\nacademic.oup.com/ntr.\nDeclaration of Interests\nNone declared.\nAuthors Contributions\nConceptualization: NP, AM, OB, BD; Data curation: NP, VM, AP, HB, FXB, \nFJ, OB; writing original draft: NP, OB, BD; statistical analysis: NP, OB.

In this paper, we compare the\npsychosocial language markers associated with diet, physical activity, substance use, and\nsmoking before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. We leverage the popular social\nmedia platform Reddit to analyze 1 million posts between January 6, 2019, to January 5,\n2021, from 22 different communities (i.e., subreddits) that belong to four broader groups—\ndiet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking. We identified that before the COVID-19\npandemic, posts involved sharing information about vacation, international travel, work,\nfamily, consumption of illicit substances, vaping, and alcohol, whereas during the pandemic,\nposts contained emotional content associated with quarantine, withdrawal symptoms, anxi-\nety, attempts to quit smoking, cravings, weight loss, and physical fitness. Prevalent topic\nanalysis showed that the pandemic was associated with discussions about nutrition, physi-\ncal fitness, and outdoor activities such as backpacking and biking, suggesting users’ focus\nshifted toward their physical health during the pandemic. Starting from the week of March\n23, 2020, when several stay-at-home policies were enacted, users wrote more about coping\nwith stress and anxiety, alcohol misuse and abuse, and harm-reduction strategies like\nswitching from hard liquor to beer/wine after people were socially isolated. In addition, posts\nrelated to use of substances such as benzodiazepines (valium, xanax, clonazepam), nootro-\npics (kratom, phenibut), and opioids peaked around March 23, 2020, followed by a decline.\nOf note, unlike the general decline observed, the volume of posts related to alternatives to\nheroin (e.g., fentanyl) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Posts about quitting smok-\ning gained momentum after late March 2020, and there was a sharp decline in posts about\ncraving to smoke. This study highlights the significance of studying social media discussions\non platforms like Reddit which are a rich ecological source of human experiences and pro-\nvide insights to inform targeted messaging and mitigation strategies, and further comple-\nment ongoing traditional primary data collection methods.\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337\nFebruary 3, 2023\n1 / 17\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Wanchoo K, Abrams M, Merchant RM,\nUngar L, Guntuku SC (2023) Reddit language\nindicates changes associated with diet, physical\nactivity, substance use, and smoking during\nCOVID-19.

Introduction\nWith the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, people struggled with uncertainty and social isola-\ntion and experienced loss of income, mobility, social engagement [1] and collectively these fac-\ntors negatively impacted physical health [2].\nSeveral recent studies aimed to observe and quantify the impact of COVID-19 on physical\nhealth using different empirical methods. A prospective study aimed at assessing the impact of\npandemic restrictions on physical activity patterns of Dutch patients affected with cardiovas-\ncular disease (CVD) found a minor increase in physical activity levels versus a larger increase\nin sedentary time in Dutch CVD patients during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic [2].\nOnline questionnaires measuring physical activity, physical and mental health, anxiety, and\ndepressive symptoms in France and Switzerland also report a significant increase in sedentary\nbehavior in the initial weeks of pandemic [3]. A recent study conducted in the United States\nfound that the blood pressure of both men and women increased significantly from April 2020\nthrough December 2020, compared with the same period in 2019 [4].\nIn this study, we sought to evaluate the expression of health and lifestyle behavior changes\nsurrounding diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking as the COVID-19 pandemic\nunfolded. People are increasingly using social media to post and share about their health and\nlifestyle behaviors [5–7]. We use natural language processing and machine learning techniques\non text conversations extracted from a popular publicly available social media platform, Red-\ndit, to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on health and lifestyle behaviors that are known risk\nfactors of cardiovascular disease [8]. Our fundamental hypothesis was that the health behaviors\ndepicted by language of people active on Reddit in the specified subreddits would be signifi-\ncantly different after the pandemic struck the world. This language would reveal how health\nbehavior choices of individuals changed pre-pandemic versus during pandemic.\n1.1 Background and related work\n1.1.1 Cardiovascular risk factors and COVID-19.\nSeveral mortality studies showed a\nclear increase in coronary heart disease mortality with an increase in the number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day, regardless of the actual number [9, 10]. Further, it has been shown that both\nactive and passive smoking contribute to more than 30% of coronary heart disease (CHD)\nmortality cases [11]. Alcohol consumption of three or more drinks is associated with increased\nblood pressure and triglycerides levels [12]. In another study, light to moderate alcohol intake\nwas associated with 51% CVD mortality compared with abstainers [13]. Similarly, diet and\nphysical activity contribute significantly to cardiovascular health [2, 3]. Prior work found that\npatients with CVD have high mortality rates when diagnosed with COVID-19 [14]. The use of\ne-cigarettes (vaping), or consumption of tobacco has also been shown to increase the risk of\ninfection and progression of COVID-19 [12, 15, 16]. Further, recent studies show that people\nexperiencing substance use disorders (SUD) are both more likely to develop COVID-19 dis-\nease as well as experience worse COVID-19 outcomes [17]. Prior work also demonstrated a\ndecrease in physical activity levels in Dutch CVD patients during the first wave of COVID-19\npandemic with an increase in sedentary time [2].\n1.1.2 Reddit and health behaviors.\nReddit is a publicly available online platform with\nmostly anonymous and detailed narratives and experiences from over 52 million daily active\nusers participating in more than 100,000 communities (a.k.a. subreddits) [18]. Reddit posts\ninclude detailed accounts of individuals’ beliefs, concerns, and behaviors, due to the platform\naffordances such as user anonymity and freedom of speech [19]. The diverse, profound, and\noutspoken nature of the discussions on Reddit, make it an apt resource for analyzing individu-\nals’ health behaviors. In the past two years, there have been several research studies assessing\nPLOS ONE\nReddit language indicates changes associated with physical health during COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337\nFebruary 3, 2023\n2 / 17\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\ndifferent health behaviors using subreddits. Prior data supports that people share their experi-\nences on social media to emotionally cope with pandemic-related anxieties [20–22]. Study on\npropagation of situational information on social media during COVID-19 with the help of nat-\nural language processing has proven to be relevant [23]. Further, changes in people’s emotions\nand thought patterns during the pandemic were studied to uncover large psychological shifts\nreflecting three distinct phases of the COVID-19 pandemic [24]. Reddit was also used to char-\nacterize and predict shifts from a discussion of mental health to the expression of suicidal idea-\ntion [20, 25], albeit pre-pandemic. A study showed that people widely used social media to\nexpress their moods [26]. The same study predicted depressed users as well as estimated their\ndepression intensity using computational linguistics [26]. In [27] authors compared 1.53 bil-\nlion geotagged English tweets with Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index survey through 1.73\nmillion phone surveys and concluded that data-driven language models leveraging supervised\nmachine methods generated valid geographical estimates of well-being. County level tweets\nwithin the US were used to correlate stressful emotions with health behaviors and socioeco-\nnomic characteristics [28]. 15.4 million Facebook messages were assessed to demonstrate that\nopen-vocabulary analyses could yield correlations between personality and behavior as mani-\nfested through natural language [29].\n1.2 Research questions\nThis paper addresses the following questions:\n• How did the engagement, measured by the number of posts and new users, across subreddits\nassociated with diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking change during 2019 and\n2020 (termed as pre- and during pandemic)?\n• What discussions, represented using probabilistic generative topic models, were prominent\nacross subreddits associated with diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking pre-pan-\ndemic versus during pandemic?\n2. Methods\n2.1 Data\nWe identified 22 online communities, termed as subreddits on Reddit, that belong to four\nbroader groups—diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking—and studied how language\nassociated with the behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of physical health\nchanged across 2019 and 2020. For example, subreddits such as r/Drugs, r/addiction, r/1P_LSD,\nr/alcoholism, r/stopdrinking facilitate discussions on consumption or effects of illicit substances\nor alcohol or experiences of people upon attempts of quitting marijuana. Similarly, r/bicycling,\nr/skiing, r/backpacking have discussions about physical activities. Table 1 shows the number of\nsubreddits, posts, and percentage distribution of posts across the four broader groups.\nTable 1. Data summary of subreddits across broader groups.\nBroader Group\nSubreddits\nDistribution of subreddits\nTotal number of posts\nDistribution of posts\nTotal number of unique users per broader group\nDiet\n6\n27%\n263,647\n27%\n142,738\nSubstance Use\n7\n32%\n450,315\n46%\n193,991\nPhysical Activity\n5\n23%\n166,812\n17%\n82,940\nSmoking\n4\n18%\n96,850\n10%\n49,524\nTotal\n22\n100%\n977,624\n100%\n469,193\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337.t001\nPLOS ONE\nReddit language indicates changes associated with physical health during COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337\nFebruary 3, 2023\n3 / 17\nWe obtained the data using the Pushshift API [30]. The posts from respective subreddits\nwere scraped using PRAW and PSAW python packages from January 6, 2019, to January 5,\n2021. Of the subreddits where individuals were discussing diet, physical activities, substance\nuse, alcohol, or smoking, we identified 22 that had been created before January 2019 and had\nmore than 1,000 posts per subreddit. In total, we obtained 977,624 posts by 435, 041 users in\nour dataset. WHO published the first Disease Outbreak News on the novel Coronavirus [31]\non January 5, 2020, and on January 15, 2020, CDC revealed the first COVID-19 infection in\nthe United States of America [32]. We define the ‘pre-covid’ timeline from January 6, 2019, to\nJanuary 5, 2020, and the ‘during covid’ timeline from January 6, 2020, to January 5, 2021. The\nfinal list of subreddits that were used for the analysis has been mentioned in S1 Table in S1\nFile.\nThis analysis was on fully public data and our prior correspondence with University of\nPennsylvania IRB verified that such studies did not need approval.\n2.2 Language feature extraction\nUsing the DLATK Python package [33], we extracted words and phrases from the entire set of\n977,624 posts. Features that were not present in at least 5% of the posts were excluded as outli-\ners. Pointwise mutual information (PMI) [34] was used to retain high occurrence probability\nfeatures with a threshold of greater than 6. We removed common English stop words from the\nMALLET package along with most frequent words mentioning COVID-19 and Coronavirus.\nUsing the MALLET implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a set of 50, 100,\nand 200 topics were created. Coherence scores for each of the three sets of topics were calcu-\nlated to assess the quality of topics as shown in S13 Table in S1 File. Three coherence measures\nC_V (0, 1), C_UCI (0,1), and C_NPMI (0,1) were used for evaluation [35]. This was followed\nby authors’ interpretation of the topics from the top words within each of the three sets. 200\ntopics were chosen. The probability distribution for each post across all 200 topics was\nobtained. Each post is represented as a 200-dimensional vector and then aggregated to the\nlevel of {user, subreddit, timeframe}, where the time frame is defined as pre- or during\nCOVID-19. The top 15 words and 10 posts most associated with each significant topic were\nidentified by the authors to ascertain the subject matter of the latent topics [36].\n2.3 Engagement across broader groups\nParticipation levels within a broader group were measured using the volume of posts made\nevery week [37]. The number of posts were aggregated per week within all subreddits belong-\ning to respective broader groups to represent a broader group’s weekly participation activity\nlevel. The influx of new users was assessed by following the methodology from prior work\n[37], calculated every week within all subreddits belonging to respective broader groups. In\norder to eliminate the possibility of a general trend (downward/upward) in participation levels\nand influx of new users and not specifically due to the quarantine we applied Interrupted Time\nSeries (ITS) [37, 38] method on the weekly count of posts and new users to assess the salience\nof the week of March 23, 2020. In this method we separately regressed the weekly message\ncounts (yi) and new user counts (yi) data on weeks (xi) while also including an indicator vari-\nable (1{xi > c}) referred to as ‘pandemic’ response variable henceforth, to indicate the period\nbefore the week of March 23, 2020 (coded 0) or the period after the week of March 23, 2020\n(coded 1) [39]. c indicates the threshold week of March 23, 2020 in the following equation:\nyi ¼ b0 þ b1xi þ b21fxi > cg þ b31fxi > cgxi\nPLOS ONE\nReddit language indicates changes associated with physical health during COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337\nFebruary 3, 2023\n4 / 17\nThis method prevents misinterpretation of a steady increase (or decrease) in time series\ntrend as a treatment effect [38]. Centering the weeks at week of March 23, 2020, was essential.\nThe coefficient (β2) of the pandemic response variable (indicator variable) after performing\nthe regression helped in quantifying the shift in engagement. We also define a metric to mea-\nsure the impact percentage (I) of the pandemic response variable (indicator variable) as fol-\nlows:\nI ¼\nb2 þ b0\nb0 \u0000 1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0003 100\nI > 0 implies that after the week of March 23, 2020, the engagements (weekly message counts\nand new user counts) increased whereas I < 0 implies otherwise. Larger the magnitude of I,\nmore prominent was the impact of pandemic restrictions on the engagement.\n2.4 Change in language markers pre- and during COVID-19\nLanguage features (words, phrases, and topics) are used as the explanatory variables (features)\nin ordinary least squares regression, and within each broader group (diet, physical activity,\nsubstance use, and smoking) and the time period—pre-pandemic or during the pandemic,\nwhich is an indicator variable is used as the pandemic indicator variable. The coefficient of the\ntarget explanatory variable is taken as the strength of the relationship. Two-tailed significance\nvalues are computed for each coefficient and a Benjamini-Hochberg method of FDR correc-\ntion is applied [40] to identify significant features (p < 0.001). We used “covid”, “quarantine”,\n“lockdown”, “coronavirus”, “covid-19”, “pandemic” and “corona” as stop words in the analy-\nses as they were prevalent in most posts during the pandemic.\n2.5 Temporal trends in topics across broader health behaviors\nTo identify topics associated with the four broader groups, we repeat the analyses, with features\naggregated at the user-subreddit level, but with indicator variables for each of the broader top-\nics as the pandemic indicator variable. We find the Pearson correlations (denoted as ‘r’ hence-\nforth) between topics and the four broader groups (diet, physical activity, substance use, and\nsmoking). For diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking we found a total of 59, 56,\n110, and 53 significant topics respectively, which can be used as the language markers of each\nbroader group. We then analyze the topic distribution over time (2019–2020) for all positively\nsignificant topics across the four broader groups.\n3. Results\nTo assess the change in engagement across each broader group, we measure participation lev-\nels within a broader group by calculating the number of posts made in each week separately\nfor the pre-covid and during COVID-19 time frames. Then, we study changes in words,\nphrases, and topic features pre- and during COVID-19 and trends in language markers across\n2019 and 2020.\n3.1 Engagement across broader groups\nFig 1 represents weekly message counts from the diet, physical activity, substance use, and\nsmoking broader groups. For diet and physical activity broader groups, we observe a signifi-\ncant jump (p < 0.001) in the number of weekly posts after the week of March 23, 2020. It is\nthat week in the month of March, several stay-at-home orders were issued.

International travel (‘trip’, ‘travel’, ‘asia’,\n‘countries’, ‘thailand’, r = -0.162) maintains a decreasing trend after the week of March 23,\n2020.\nSubstance use: Discussions of therapy (‘rehab’, ‘detox’, ‘treatment’, ‘hospital’, ‘therapy’,\nr = 0.033), stress (‘stress’, ‘anxiety’, ‘deal’, ‘feelings’, ‘emotions’, r = 0.065), withdrawal symp-\ntoms (‘symptoms’, ‘withdrawals’, ‘cold turkey’, ‘shakes’, ‘seizures’, r = 0.026), beer/wine (‘beer’,\n‘wine’, ‘bottle’, ‘iwndwyt’, ‘glass of wine’, r = 0.029), problems related to alcoholism (‘problem’,\n‘alcoholic’, ‘drunk’, ‘drank’, ‘alcoholism’, r = 0.062), and social drinking (‘night’, ‘friends’, ‘bar’,\n‘party’, ‘drunk’, r = -0.056) increase in prevalence after the week of March 23, 2020 and topics\nabout substances such as benzodiazepines (‘xanax’, ‘took’, ‘benzos’, ‘valium’, ‘mg’, r = -0.018),\nnootropics (‘dxm’, ‘kratom’, ‘phenibut’, ‘dph’, ‘benadryl’, r = -0.033), and opioids (‘oxycodone’,\n‘opiates’, ‘pill’, ‘morphine’, ‘opioids’, r = -0.006) increase from the week of January 6, 2020,\nuntil the week of March 23, 2020, and decline gradually over the next four weeks.\nSmoking: Topics about withdrawal symptoms (‘symptoms’, ‘withdrawals’, ‘cold turkey’,\n‘shakes’, ‘seizures’, r = 0.125) and attempts to quit smoking (‘quit’, ‘cigarette’, ‘pack’, ‘quitting’,\n‘cravings’, r = 0.140) exhibit a rising trend whereas discussions on pulmonary sickness (‘throat’,\n‘sick’, ‘chest’, ‘lungs’, ‘cough’, ‘breathing’, r = 0.097) drop over 8–10 weeks after the week of\nMarch 23, 2020. Craving to smoke (‘craving’, ‘strong’, ‘urge’, ‘thoughts’, ‘fight’, r = 0.130) topic\nwitnesses a steep drop whereas users rebuild their interest in discussions about other sources of\nnicotine (‘nicotine’, ‘juul’, ‘tobacco’, ‘gum’, ‘patch’, r = 0.026) after the week of March 23, 2020.\n4. Discussion\nAnalyses of Reddit posts revealed significant changes in health behavior expressions around\ndiet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe changes were reflected in both engagement, measured by the number of posts and influx\nof new users, and content of posts, measured by words and phrases and thematic content.\nIn the week of March 23, 2020, several stay-at-home orders were issued [41]. While there\nwas heterogeneity in the way policies were enacted in each country and state, around this\nweek, a paradigm shift in social and physical behavior had been initiated. The lockdown man-\ndate implied restaurants, gyms, sports complexes, had to shut their doors to in-person custom-\ners to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This transition also was mirrored in discussions\nonline, both in terms of engagement and participation levels across the 22 subreddits associ-\nated with diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking, and the thematic content of\nusers’ posts within those categories.\nThe first research question in this paper assessed how engagement levels within each\nbroader group changed after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We observed a significant\nincrease in the volume of weekly posts made after the week of March 23, 2020, across the diet\nand physical activity subreddit categories. The impact percentage suggests that the week of\nMarch 23, 2020, led to 36.90% and 57.70% increase in weekly posts within diet and physical\nactivity subreddits. This increase could potentially be due to either existing users posting about\ntheir diet and physical activity at a much higher rate during the COVID-19 pandemic or new\nusers joining the diet and physical activity subreddits contributing to the surge in activity lev-\nels. For each broader category, the factor underlying the change in engagement levels from\npre- to during pandemic became clear by analyzing the weekly new user influx from 2019 to\n2021. We observed a significant increase in the number of new users after the week of March\n23, 2020, for the diet and physical activity subreddits aligning with the upsurge in weekly activ-\nity for each of the two broader groups. The impact percentage suggests that the week of March\n23, 2020, led to 36.06% and 76.08% increase in weekly new users within diet and physical\nPLOS ONE\nReddit language indicates changes associated with physical health during COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337\nFebruary 3, 2023\n12 / 17\nactivity subreddits. This suggests that the proportion of users interested in diet and exercise\nmay have broadened.\nThere were notable thematic differences in content between subreddits within each cate-\ngory before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon observing the thematic topics, we\nfound language markers ranging from generic topics corresponding to themes such as vaca-\ntion/travel, work, family, to specific topics corresponding to themes such as substance use,\nbike parts, vape parts, withdrawal symptoms, and pulmonary sickness. We found factual topics\nexhibiting general information such as the ban on illicit substances by the government, vape\nparts, purchase of illicit substances, bike parts, etc. and emotionally charged topics about\nattempts to quit smoking, withdrawal symptoms, binge eating, anxiety, and craving to smoke.\nThe analysis revealed that users were posting more about emotions and feelings during the\npandemic versus before the pandemic they focused more on facts and details.\nTemporal trends of significant prevalent topics revealed that Reddit users after the week of\nMarch 23, 2020, discussed more about nutrition in diet, physical fitness, and outdoor activities\nsuch as backpacking and biking. This suggests that the pandemic and social isolation could\nhave potentially driven users to place increased focus on their physical health. After observing\nprevalent topic distributions from substance use subreddits we can infer that users wrote more\nabout coping with stress and anxiety, alcohol misuse and how it was affecting their lives, and\nswitching to beer and wine from other forms of alcohol after the isolation began from the\nweek of March 23, 2020. Exposure to stress in different forms is closely associated with subse-\nquent alcohol consumption. In fact, individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD)\nare more likely to drink to cope with different traumatic events [42].\nA study on substance use during the pandemic cites a reporting system, ODMAP, that\nshows an 18% increase in substance overdoses in the US in the early months of the pandemic\ncompared with those same months in 2019 [43]. Our results showed a similar spike in the dis-\ncussions on substances such as benzodiazepines (valium, xanax, clonazepam), nootropics (kra-\ntom, phenibut), and opioids (fentanyl, oxycodone, morphine) around the week of March 23,\n2020. Illicit drug unavailability and increased mental stress during the isolation may have\ndriven the discussions toward the consumption of opioid alternatives such as fentanyl, kratom,\netc., which we observed. However, increase in discussions after the week of March 23, 2020,\nabout rehabilitation, therapy, and withdrawal symptoms hint at users attempting to quit alco-\nhol and illicit substances.\nPrevalent topics from smoking subreddits showed that the onset of pandemic led to\nincrease in discussions around quitting smoking, analyzing other sources of nicotine such as\nnicotine gums and patches, and withdrawal symptoms. Further, discussions on their cravings\nto smoke saw a decline after the week of March 23, 2020. All these observations possibly hint\nthat users were aware of pulmonary risks associated with COVID-19 and sought attempts to\nquit smoking or switch to other forms of nicotine.\n4.1 Limitations\nA recent study [42] reported a 54% increase in national sales of alcohol for the week ending\nMarch 21, 2020, compared with 1 year before in the United States. Online alcohol sales had expe-\nrienced a surge of 262% from 2019 in the US. The Federal Trade Commission reported a 0.4%\nincrease in cigarette sales in the US from 202.9 billion in 2019 to 203.7 billion in 2020 [44]. The\nincrease in tobacco sales had been observed for the first time in two decades. The unavailability\nof geographic locations in Reddit limited our study from analyzing changes in language markers\nfrom posts at the state or county level and comparing those with offline statistics such as cardio-\nvascular health outcomes. Like most social media studies, our data is not representative of the\nPLOS ONE\nReddit language indicates changes associated with physical health during COVID-19\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280337\nFebruary 3, 2023\n13 / 17\ngeneral population even though Reddit is one of the most popular platforms in the US. In [45]\nwe find that approximately 50% of the Reddit traffic flows from the US. Reddit being an anony-\nmous forum does not reveal demographics of users and we extrapolate the country traffic distri-\nbution on our dataset. While we included most subreddits that deal with the four broader health\nbehaviors of interest to this study with reasonable participation, we could have missed some. We\nwould like to further highlight that the focus of the research was not on the intricacies of the\nnature of the four health behaviors while shortlisting the subreddits. As observed in S1 Table in\nS1 File, Physical Activity broader group may have been biased with outdoor physical activity sub-\nreddits compared to indoor physical activity subreddits such as Yoga or HIIT. Similarly, certain\nsubstances might be easier to obtain and might have contributed more to the discussions within\nsubreddits from Substance Use broader group. Moreover, similar to self-reporting on health\nbehaviors, posting about quitting smoking, illicit substances, or alcohol is not evidence that the\nusers have quit smoking, stopped alcohol consumption, or ceased substance use. This conversa-\ntion-action gap could potentially be alleviated by considering multiple modalities of user data,\nwhile it potentially comes at the cost of user privacy. Social media conversations are a comple-\nmentary source to the data obtained by traditional surveys and further provide insights that\ncould potentially not be obtained from traditional methods owing to their paradigm.\nPublic health events such as COVID-19 that resulted in isolation and quarantine had a sub-\nstantial impact on population physical and mental health globally. Our study highlights the\nimportance of social media discussions on platforms like Reddit that offer ecological and\nlarge-scale data to summarize and potentially measure changes in health behaviors. The candid\nand open expressions on social media data could well complement the rich traditional data\ncollection methods and further provide insights for real-time public health infoveillance, and\ntargeted messaging at the times of crises.\nPre-pandemic and during pandemic language comparisons to suggest changes in health\nbehaviors in this paper are made over several weeks and many sociopolitical factors over time\ncould have influenced results in different ways. For example, changes in tax rates of cigarettes\nor alcohol or impact of protests and elections in the US during the timeframe of our study.\nSuch situations might have impacted the size of and direction of language markers over time.\nWe do not assume that COVID-19 pandemic is the sole cause of the changes in health behav-\niors depicted through social media language, but rather that these changes are only associated\nto the pandemic. Of note, there are methods from causal inference for observational studies\nsuch as propensity score matching that could be leveraged to go beyond association claims and\nstrengthen causal claims.\nTopic models are algorithms that aid in discovering important themes from a large and\nunstructured collection of documents [46]. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is one of the simplest\ntopic modelling algorithms that belongs to the class of generative probabilistic models [46]. It\nhowever has its fair share of limitations. Topic modeling has evolved over time and newer\nmore sophisticated techniques such as [47, 48] for topic modeling leveraging deep learning\nembeddings are available.\nSupporting information\nS1 File.

Our study aims to \nfind out the association between smoking and COVID-19 severity.\nSubjects and Methods: This comparative study was conducted among hospitalized \nseverely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, as well as asymptomatic, mild, and moderate \npatients from the list of the city corporation (Dhaka, Bangladesh), as confirmed by reverse- \ntranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 2022 adults aged ≥18 years \nwere enrolled in this study.\nResults: The mean age of the patients was 41.17 years; 66.96% of the patients were male, \n57.02% were aged above 35 years, and 81.50% of the patients had ever been married; and \n33.09% cases were mild and 14.99% were severe. Among the patients, 29.4% were ever- \nsmokers. Smoking status, duration, and frequency, and the presence of comorbidities were \nsignificantly associated with COVID-19 severity (p<0.001). Ever-smokers were 1.35 times \n(95% CI: 0.74–2.45), 1.30 times (95% CI: 0.58–2.87), and 2.45 times (95% CI: 1.07–5.61) \nmore likely to be mild, severe, and critical cases in comparison to non-smokers.\nConclusion: This study revealed a strong association between smoking and COVID-19 \nseverity that calls for mass awareness and cessation campaigns from governments and \nvoluntary organizations.\nKeywords: COVID-19, smoking, ICU, RT-PCR, Bangladesh\nIntroduction\nThe emergence of viral disease has always been a serious threat to public health. \nOver the past two decades, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 2002–2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 were \ntwo big threats to the world in the form of an epidemic and a pandemic.1 \nCurrently, the world is facing another viral disease, coronavirus disease 2019 \n(COVID-19), which was announced as a pandemic by the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC, 2020), the characteristics of people who are at risk \nof suffering severe illness from COVID-19 are people aged over 65 years; people \nliving in a long-term care facility; people with asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, \nliver disease, or heart disease; people who have immunodeficiency as a result of \ndisease; and people who have unhealthy behavior, such as smoking.2–6\nAccording to the WHO factsheet (2020), globally, more than 8 million people \ndie of tobacco smoking every year, of whom 7 million are direct smokers and \n1.2 million are second-hand smokers.4 Since COVID-19 has a severe stage of \nCorrespondence: Mohammad Delwer \nHossain Hawlader  \nDepartment of Public Health, North \nSouth University, Bashundhara, Dhaka, \n1229, Bangladesh  \nTel +8801747439378  \nEmail mohammad.hawlader@northsouth. \nedu\nJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14 1923–1933                                               \n1923\n© 2021 Mohsin et al.

Since no research has been conducted on this \nissue so far, to lessen this knowledge gap and to assess the \ntrue magnitude of the problem, this research is much \nneeded in the current situation. Therefore, our aim was \nto explore the association between smoking and the sever­\nity of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Design\nThis was a comparative study where the data were col­\nlected both from hospitals in Dhaka and by telephone \ninterviews with COVID-19-positive patients, whose status \nwas confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain \nreaction (RT-PCR). The total sample size of the study was \n2022, comprising 355, 669, 361, 303, and 334 samples for \nthe asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical \ncategories, respectively. This was determined using the \nformula of sample size calculation in a comparative \nstudy setting using 80% power. Hospitals were chosen \nconveniently from where the severe and critical patients \nwere selected for interviews. For asymptomatic, mild, and \nmoderate cases, interviews were conducted over telephone \nfollowing the list collected from city corporation booths in \nDhaka. Adult patients of 18 years of age and above were \nincluded in this study.\nMeasures\nIn accordance with the Bangladesh Society of Medicine, \nCOVID-19 cases were categorized as asymptomatic, mild, \nmoderate, severe, and critical.15 According to the guide­\nline from the CDC, only people who have smoked at least \n100 cigarettes and are still continuing to smoke were \nconsidered as smokers,5 and those who have smoked \nfewer than 100 cigarettes ever were considered as non- \nsmokers. The information on smoking was collected by \nasking questions of the study population, mainly focusing \non whether they have ever smoked cigarettes, and the \nresponses were coded as non-smokers=0 and ever- \nsmokers=1. All of these queries were asked of all the \nstudy population, and the categories were determined by \ntaking ideas from the mentioned guidelines and previously \npublished studies.5\nStatistical Analysis\nSTATA version 16 was used for analyzing the data. \nDescriptive statistics were reported as frequency and per­\ncentage to characterize the demographic profile of the \nstudy sample. Differences in socio-demographic factors \nbetween the five COVID-19-positive groups were pre­\nsented using the chi-squared test. For univariate analysis \nof continuous variables, t-test and one-way ANOVA were \nperformed. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was \nalso performed to assess the effects of risk factors on the \nseverity of COVID-19. The associations between exposure \nto smoking and COVID-19 severity outcomes and the \neffects of the potential risk factors on COVID-19 severity \nwere investigated using both univariable and multivariable \nlogistic regression models. The univariate or unadjusted \nmodels included only one exposure variable and the out­\ncome variable each time for all the potential risk factors. \nThen, these associations were progressively adjusted for \npotential confounders in the multivariable (multinomial \nlogistic regression) model, including 11 risk factors: gen­\nder, age, marital status, educational level, ethnicity, occu­\npation, residence type, smoking status, years of smoking, \nnumbers of cigarettes smoked in total, and comorbidities. \nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S317603                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nDovePress                                                                                                                                         \nJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14 \n1924\nMohsin et al                                                                                                                                                          \nDovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n(Only statistically significant [p<0.05] variables found in \nthe univariate analysis of the chi-square test were \nincluded.) Results were reported as adjusted odds ratios \n(AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical \ntests were two sided, and a p-value <0.05 was considered \nstatistically significant.\nEthics\nAll the procedures were conducted following the ethical \nguidelines of the institution’s review board (IRB)/ethical \nreview committee (ERC) of North South University, \nBangladesh (Memo no. 2020/OR-NSU/IRB-No. 0802). \nThe ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration \nof Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical \nstandards were followed wherever applicable. During the \nface-to-face interview, informed written consent was \nobtained from all the participants involved in the study. \nHowever, electronic consent was attached to the web- \nbased questionnaire, where the nature, purpose, and objec­\ntive of the study were clearly stated, along with the \ndeclaration of confidentiality and anonymity.\nResults\nAmong all 2022 COVID-19 patients, 16.52% of patients \nwere critical, 14.99% were severe, 17.85% were moderate, \n33.09% were mild, and 17.56% were asymptomatic. The \nmean age of the patients was 41.17±15.11 years. Overall, \n66.96% of the patients were males and 57.02% were aged \nabove 35 years; 33.58% of the patients had studied to \nhigher secondary level, 32.05% of the patients were office \nemployees; the majority (81.50%) of the patients had ever \nbeen married, 70.82% of the patients were living in urban \nresidential areas, most of them (95.10%) were Bengali, \nand most (91.59%) were Muslim (Table 1).\nIn the bivariate associations of COVID-19 severity \noutcomes with socio-demographic characteristics by each \nsub-domain, it was observed that gender (χ2=15.81, \np=0.003), age (χ2=256.70, p<0.001), marital status \n(χ2=183.82, p<0.001), educational level (χ2=115.63, \np<0.001), occupation (χ2=237.32, p<0.001), residential \nstatus (χ2=126.56, p<0.001), and ethnicity (χ2=18.20, \np=0.001) were significantly associated with COVID-19 \nseverity. Comparing the mean differences between the \ncase type of COVID-19 with patients’ age, the mean age \nof the COVID-positive patients (41.17±15.11 years) was \nalso significantly different among the five types of \nCOVID-19 groups (95% CI: 17.86–22.80; p<0.001).\nThe results from bivariate associations of COVID-19 \nseverity outcomes with behavioral factors and comorbid­\nities are presented in Table 2. Among the COVID- \npositive patients, 29.4% were ever-smokers, of whom \n6.92% of patients had smoked for more than 25 years in \ntheir lives and 28.68% had smoked at least 100 cigarettes \nin their lives. Among all the behavioral factors, smoking \nstatus \n(χ2=38.88, \np<0.001), \nduration of \nsmoking \n(χ2=442.99, p<0.001), frequency of cigarettes smoked \n(χ2=58.16, p<0.001), and having any other diseases \n(χ2=472.01, p<0.001) were significantly associated with \nCOVID-19 severity. The prevalence of having any other \ndiseases was 46.24% for the study participants. \nComparing the mean differences between the case type \nof COVID-19 with the frequency of cigarette smoking \nyears, the average number of cigarette smoking years \n(5.25±10.20) was found to be significantly different \namong the five case types (95% CI: 1.03–10.01; \np<0.001) (Table 2).\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of COVID-19 severity \namong the ever-smokers and non-smokers. More severe \nand critical cases were ever-smokers, at 20.37% and \n18.86%, respectively, whereas it was found that 12.75% \nand 15.55% of severe and critical patients, respectively, \nwere non-smokers.\nThe overall results of the multinomial logistic regres­\nsion analysis of the effect of the potential risk factors on \nthe development of COVID-19 severity among the \nCOVID-positive patients are presented in Table 3. In this \nmodel, only the variables found to be statistically signifi­\ncant (p<0.05) in the bivariate analysis were included. \nTherefore, the multinomial logistic regression analysis \nused 11 risk factors (gender, age, marital status, education, \nethnicity, occupation, residency, smoking status, years of \nsmoking, number of cigarettes smoked in total, and comor­\nbidities) and their effects on COVID-positive case types.\nAmong all the COVID-positive patients, those who \nwere ever-smokers at some point in their lives were 1.35 \ntimes (95% CI: 0.74–2.45), 1.30 times (95% CI: 0.58– \n2.87), and 2.45 times (95% CI: 1.07–5.61) more likely to \nbe mild, severe, and critical COVID patients, respectively, \ncompared to those who were non-smokers, but ever- \nsmoker patients were 0.96 times (95% CI: 0.48–1.90) \nless likely to be moderate patients compared to those \nwho were non-smokers, after adjusting all other \ncovariates.\nIt was found that females were 1.10 times more \nlikely to be mild COVID patients compared to males \nJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14

Analysis shows that ever- \nsmokers are at 2.45 times higher risk of having critical \ncondition than never-smokers, which complies with the \nprevious research conducted by the CDC COVID-19 \nResponse Team in the USA in 2020,5 and many other \nstudies conducted in China.10,16–18 The study results also \nshow that smokers with a longer active smoking history \nare more prone to developing the severe and critical \nstages of COVID-19, which is a new finding compared \nto other COVID-19 and smoking-related studies.\nIn the demographic factor analysis, age, gender, educa­\ntional status, ethnicity, marital status, residential type, and \noccupation were significantly associated with COVID-19 \nseverity. Here, it was found that cases aged more than 35 \nyears suffered from a more severe state than people below \nthis age. Although the CDC marked elderly people (>60 \nyears) as the vulnerable group,5 studies have also found \nthat younger and older adults are the groups with most \nexposure and increased numbers of cases.19–21 According \nto these studies, adults are exposed at their workplace, \nduring transportation, or at other gatherings, as they are \nthe main earners in their families. Also, above 35 years of \nage is considered to be a potential stage for developing \nnon-communicable diseases,22 which may increase the \nseverity of a COVID patient, as the presence of any \nother diseases has also been found to be positively asso­\nciated with COVID-19 severity.23\nThis study found that females are less likely than males \nto be in critical and severe COVID statess. This finding \ncomplies with a study conducted in China in 2020, where \nCai showed that males are more vulnerable than females to \ncritical COVID-19 states owing to their predisposition to \nsmoking.24 Males are more likely than females to be ever- \nsmokers, which increases their odds of having more smok­\ning-related diseases, contributing to the severe and critical \nlevels of the patients. Higher educational status is signifi­\ncantly related to COVID-19 severity. This finding does not \ncomply with the findings from other studies conducted in \nSweden, Germany, and New York City, USA. Studies \nconducted in western countries have found that education \nis a protective factor against COVID-19, as the lower the \neducational \nlevel, \nthe \ngreater \nthe \nexposure \nto \ngatherings and personal contacts, along with lower main­\ntenance \nof \nhand \nhygiene.21,25,26 \nThe \nauthors \nof \nthose studies also linked socio-economic status with edu­\ncational level, which was followed by healthcare inequal­\nities for people of low income categories with lower \neducational level. However, in Bangladesh, more severe \ncases are found among highly educated people than among \npeople with lower levels of education. This is probably \ndue to lifestyle and occupation, which are correlated with \neducation in Bangladesh. The higher the education, the \nmore sedentary a lifestyle is adopted. People with higher \neducation are mostly involved in occupations that require \nmore brain work than muscle work, which also provide \nthem with better socio-economic security and thus encou­\nrage them to have sedentary lifestyles.23 An inactive life­\nstyle is a risk factor for all sorts of non-communicable \ndiseases, which increase the case severity by acting as \ncomorbid diseases.27 Another probable reason could be \nthe ignorance of people with lower educational level in \nreporting cases or letting cases go unnoticed. However, as \nthis finding doesn't comply with previous findings, further \ninvestigations are needed. , .\nAlthough medical professionals are the frontline work­\ners during the COVID situation and at the highest level of \nrisk risk because of direct contact, unemployed patients \nwere found to be at two times higher risk of developing \na severe condition. This may seem surprising, but, in line \nwith previous research, this finding provides a good \ninsight into the reasons. A study conducted in Germany \nprovided the same result and, based on a previously con­\nstructed framework, they provided three reasons for this: \ninequalities in exposure, inequalities in vulnerability, and \ninequalities in care.28 According to that study, these three \ninequalities are linked to the socio-economic position. \nPeople with lower socio-economic position do not have \naccess to proper healthcare, and because they do not \nreceive \ntimely \nhealthcare, \nthe \nCOVID \nsituation \nworsens among unemployed people.2 Retired people are \nalso found to be at almost 14 times higher risk than \nmedical professionals. Given that the retirement age in \nBangladesh is 61 years, this finding is valid, as elderly \nage has already been proven to be a risk factor for the \nseverity of COVID-19.\nJournal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2021:14                                                                                 \nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S317603                                                                  \nDovePress                                                                \n1931\nDovepress                                                                                                                                                          \nMohsin et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nIn the non-residential urban localities and rural areas, \nthe severity of COVID-19 was found to be almost three \ntimes and two times higher, respectively, than in the urban \nresidential areas. As the urban residential areas are \nplanned areas with proper healthcare facilities and lower \npopulation density, the spread of the virus is limited there \nand instant healthcare facilities are available to prevent the \ndevelopment of severe disease. In contrast, in urban non- \nresidential areas and rural areas, these facilities are out of \nthe reach of most people. In addition, the maintenance of \nhygiene required to prevent COVID-19 is often not possi­\nble owing to the population density.\nIn this study, ever-married people were found to have \na higher risk than never-married people of having severe \nand critical stages of COVID-19. This may be because \never-married people are in contact with their partners and \nother family members at home, which increases the expo­\nsure of ever-married people in comparison to the never- \nmarried group. However, previous studies have shown that \nsmoking, which has a positive association with COVID-19 \nseverity, has an increased rate among never-married peo­\nple, probably as a result of several stress issues.29,30 This \nmay indicate the opposite direction from the finding, and \nrequires further investigation.\nAdjusting for other factors, ethnicity was found to be \nsignificantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Chakma \npeople and other indigenous ethnic groups were found to \nbe at 3.43 times higher risk of having the critical stage of \nCOVID-19. This could be due to the inaccessible food and \nhealthcare facilities in the remote area where the indigen­\nous people reside. Along with that, their weak strategy to \nprevent COVID-19 due to a lack of mass announcements \nand awareness in the remote areas may also be a reason. \nHowever, this finding complies with previous studies con­\nducted on different ethnic groups in different countries and \nstates. Studies conducted among different minority ethnic \ngroups suggest that ethnicity and COVID-19 should be \na focus for public health research area in the future.31–33\nThe main strength of this study is its sample size. This \nstudy was conducted by telephone, using a city corporation \ncase-confirmed list. The study sample comprised 2022 cases \ncovering all five stages of COVID-19. This resulted in \na larger sample size than in any other study conducted on \nthis issue. It also resulted in a good, representative data set, \nproperly blending some of the districts of Dhaka.\nA limitation of this study is that there were few repre­\nsentative data for different ethnic groups. In addition, in \nthe smoker category, former smokers were included. This \nmay have caused misclassification bias in a few cases. \nAlso, e-cigarette use was not included in the survey, \nwhich may have led to a few more cases being missed.\nConclusion\nSmoking is strongly associated with the severity of \nCOVID-19 disease progression. This finding calls for \nmass \nawareness \nand \ncessation \ncampaigns \nby \ngovernments and other organizations to maintain alertness \nregarding contamination by similar types of virus-borne \ndiseases. However, many other factors have also been \nfound to play associated roles in accelerating the severity \nof the disease. These factors also need immediate attention \nfrom public health professionals so that they can be inves­\ntigated further and proper measures can be introduced.\nEthical Approval\nThe study was ethically approved by the institution’s \nreview board (IRB)/ethical review committee (ERC) of \nNorth South University, Bangladesh (Memo no. 2020/OR- \nNSU/IRB-No. 0802).\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude \nto the study participants for their cooperation.

The underlying mechanisms are not\ncompletely understood, and treatment options are currently limited, as existing data focus more on\nrisk factors and predictors. Smoking has been reported as a risk factor for poor outcomes of acute\nSARS-CoV-2 infection and seems to also play a role in mediating post-COVID-19 symptoms. We\naimed to review relevant work addressing the interaction between smoking and long COVID in order\nto characterize smoking’s role as a risk factor and possibly identify new research directions. Methods:\nThe PubMed/MEDLINE database was searched using the keywords ‘smoking’, ‘long COVID’, and\n‘post-acute COVID’ to identify relevant English-language articles published up to October 2023.\nResults and conclusions: From the 374 initial hits, a total of 36 papers were deemed relevant to the\naim of the review. There was signiﬁcant variability concerning the ways in which tobacco usage was\nquantiﬁed and reported; still, there is compelling evidence linking smoking to an increased risk of\ndeveloping manifestations of post-acute-COVID disease. Some clinical conditions, such as dyspnea,\ncardiovascular symptoms, and cognitive or mental-health impairment, seem to be relatively strongly\nassociated with smoking, while the connection between smoking and upper-airway involvement\nseems less certain. The available data support recommending smoking cessation as a clinical tool for\nthe prevention of long COVID.\nKeywords: post-COVID-19 syndrome; smoking; risk factors\n1. Introduction\nLong COVID is a relatively well-known disease state that is generally deﬁned by\nthe presence of symptoms of variable intensity three months following the incomplete\nresolution of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, with those symptoms lasting for at least\ntwo months and possibly for more than a year [1]. Time points of four and twelve weeks\nare used to deﬁne a different entity, ongoing COVID-19 [2].\nThe clinical picture of long COVID is complex and of variable severity, but quality\nof life is generally impaired. A comprehensive metanalysis that included 57 studies and\n250,351 COVID survivors reviewed clinical features [3] of long COVID and classiﬁed\nthem into ﬁve main groups: neurological (headache, taste/smell disturbances, cognitive\nimpairment, memory and concentration issues), mental-health-related (depression, sleep\ndisorders, generalized anxiety disorder), respiratory (ﬁbrosis, restrictive ventilatory defects,\nchronic cough, persistent dyspnea), mobility-impairing (decreased exercise tolerance) and\nJ.

Various additional symptoms\nand clinical phenomena have been also considered, and multiple pathophysiological mech-\nanisms have been suggested [2]. These mechanisms include direct viral toxicity, endothelial\ndamage, immune dysregulation, and persistent anomalies of the angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 pathway. All of these mechanisms may be modulated by smoking, either by a\ndirect effect of nicotine or through indirect pathways, such as increased inﬂammation.\nFrom a pragmatic point of view, clinical researchers have attempted to identify po-\ntential risk factors and predictors of disease severity. This task was complicated by the\nplethora of potential issues covered by the umbrella term “long COVID” and by the limited\namount of data usually available in retrospective studies.\nSmoking is a well-recognized risk factor for various respiratory and cardiovascular\nconditions and has complicated effects on the central nervous system. For these reasons,\nsmoking is generally regarded as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in acute forms of\nSARS-CoV-2 infection, despite some controversies regarding the putative protective role\nof nicotine. Although smoking status is frequently noted in medical records and is thus\navailable for retrospective reports and analyses, there is no clear consensus regarding its\nimplications for the physiopathology of long COVID.\nThe aim of this paper is to review available published data in order to assess smoking\nas a potential predictor of the risk of developing post-acute COVID-19 from a clinical point\nof view and, potentially, to explore underlying mechanisms.\n2. Method and Research Design\nA MEDLINE/PubMed database literature search was performed using the keywords\n‘smoking’, ‘long COVID’, and ‘post acute COVID’ to build the simple logic structure ((long\nCOVID) OR (post-acute COVID) AND (smoking)). No article-type or time restrictions were\nused (up to October 2023), but the language of publication was limited to English.\nA total of 374 entries were identiﬁed, and the abstract of each entry was screened\nfor relevance. If the abstract screening proved inconclusive, the full article was analyzed\nfor relevance, which was deﬁned as results or conclusions pertaining to smoking as a\nrisk factor/predictor. The article-selection process is illustrated in the PRISMA ﬂowchart\n(Figure 1).\nJ. Pers. Med. 2024, 14, 97\n3 of 15\nFigure 1. PRISMA ﬂowchart illustrating the article-selection process. Out of 374 potential hits from\nPubMed/MEDLINE, 36 papers were included in the ﬁnal analysis.\n3. Results\nAfter the searching and screening processes were completed, a total of 36 papers\ncontaining relevant data on the potential role of smoking as a predictor or risk factor\nfor long COVID symptoms were retained. Relevant titles and details are summarized in\nTable 1.\nA total of twelve articles including over 1 million subjects reported results supporting\nan association and possibly causative link between smoking and developing long COVID.\nFurthermore, seven papers reported deleterious effects of smoking on long COVID patients,\nsuch as increased number of symptoms, higher severity, late resolution, and greater impact\non quality of life.\nSome papers reported more speciﬁc results concerning the potential harmful effects\nof smoking on various systems that can be affected by long COVID: three concerning\ncardiovascular involvement, four about respiratory disorders and persistent pulmonary\nlesions, six about neurological and mental health impacts and two about other entities.\nAmong the 34 papers, three were systematic or literature reviews in which smoking\nwas reported to be a potential risk factor or clinical predictor of the risk of developing\nsymptoms of long COVID (possibly speciﬁcally in older patients and female patients).\nJ.

It is worth mentioning that the data on vaping come from a particularly large cohort.\nFour articles mention smoking cessation as a potentially useful strategy for managing\nlong COVID in their conclusions.\n4. Discussion\nThe relation between COVID-19 and smoking proved complex and difﬁcult to assess,\neven for acute COVID-19. Although relevant raw data have been published, there are\nsometimes different interpretations of these data: a 2020 systematic review and meta-\nanalysis of 22 COVID-19 studies found that smoking has a slight detrimental effect on the\nrisks of developing severe disease and of mortality, especially for younger patients who\ndo not have diabetes [40], while a later re-analysis of the same data reached the opposite\nconclusions, suggesting a potentially protective role for nicotine [41] (albeit taking into\naccount the possibility of a reporting bias and selection bias in the original studies). Current\nopinion favors a deleterious effect of smoking on outcomes of acute COVID-19 based on\nexperimental [42] and clinical data [43].\nPublished data paint a hazy picture of the role of smoking in the pathogenesis of long\nCOVID. Some cohorts speciﬁcally report no evidence of a link, association or predictive\nrole. It is worth mentioning that a large number of included studies were not designed to\nhighlight such an effect, as they aimed to match the cohort under study and the controls in\nterms of smoking status.\nStill there are published studies that identify correlations between smoking and various\naspects of long COVID.\nSmoking in the month preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported as the most\nimportant predictor of the risk of developing long COVID symptoms (mainly those relevant\nto capacity for self-care). Smoking was followed in importance by poor sleep quality and\nlow physical activity in a British longitudinal study [28] that included 1581 patients.\nSimilarly, smoking and vaping are reported alongside female gender, obesity, older\nage, low-income household, and being a healthcare worker as predictors for persistent\nCOVID-19 symptoms at the 12-week milestone in a large British community study that\nincluded over 600,000 subjects [14].\nPost-COVID-19 manifestations may have serious consequences, apart from lower\nquality of life: one analysis using the OnCovid registry data on 2634 cancer patients [8]\nreported an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.18–2.75) and listed smoking\nhistory as a potential risk factor.\nThe functional impact of persistent COVID-19 symptoms may be difﬁcult to assess\nobjectively, but instruments have been developed for this purpose. One such instrument is\nthe Post-COVID-19 Functional Status scale [44]; using this tool with an Egyptian cohort\nfound a prognostic role for smoking [12].\nData from a Japanese long COVID cohort study that tested various therapies suggest\nthat respiratory manifestations are the most prevalent and usually the most aendable to\nmedical interventions. The study data also support the idea that smoking may increase the\nrecovery period for speciﬁc symptoms [20].\nSome published data suggest a predictive role for smoking across all groups of symp-\ntoms. For example, a Bangladeshi cohort study [21] reports odds ratios for smokers vs\nnon-smokers of 1.76 (0.93, 3.34) for developing long COVID, 1.49 (0.92, 2.44) for respiratory\nJ. Pers. Med. 2024, 14, 97\n7 of 15\nsymptoms, 1.29 (0.79, 2.11) for cardiovascular problems, 1.69 (1.05, 2.73) for neurological\nsymptoms, and 1.35 (0.70, 2.60) for mental health issues. The generality of these effects\nmay support the hypothesis that persistent inﬂammation is a cause of long COVID. Along\nthis line of reasoning, another study including 121 mild COVID-19 cases with persistent\nclinical features found an association between long COVID and low-grade inﬂamma-\ntion (instrumentalized as neutrophil count, ﬁbrinogen level, C-reactive protein level and\nneutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) and reported signiﬁcant differences between genders [45].\nThere are also published data focusing on speciﬁc symptoms. For example, a Saudi\nArabian cohort study investigating persistent taste and smell issues among 2497 COVID\npatients [33] identiﬁed different predictors on stratifying for gender: females had a higher\nrisk overall, particularly for the ﬁrst SARS-CoV-2 episode, while male gender was associated\nwith smoking and admission to intensive care.\nSimilarly, in a Chinese cohort of 121 post-COVID-19 patients, persistent chronic\ncough [34] was linked to current smoking OR 6.95, 95% CI: 1.46–33.14. As a caveat,\naccording to the authors’ interpretation, the unusually large odds ratio may be partially\nexplained by the relatively small number of smokers included in the analysis.\nProlonged respiratory symptoms are a common clinical manifestation of long COVID.\nMultiple underpinning pathophysiological changes may be responsible. For example,\npersistent lung lesions, secondary ﬁbrosis, respiratory muscle impairment, and decreased\ntransfer capacity were all reported during the convalescence phase of COVID-19 for more\nthan 50% of patients [46].\nNicotine was reported as having complex effects on the renin–angiotensin system.\nIn terms of its relevance to COVID-19, there are data suggesting down-regulation of the\nangiotensin 2 (ACE2) receptor in both its membrane-bound and soluble forms [47], but\nthere are conﬂicting reports on its increased expression in the alveolar and bronchial\nepithelia of smokers and COPD patients [48]. This change is particularly signiﬁcant for\nsubjects with COPD stage III and IV, compared with patients with less serious forms of\nCOPD and smokers without airﬂow limitations. This variable effect of nicotine exposure\non ACE2 receptor expression might explain the various contradictory reports on a putative\nprotective role of smoking against COVID-19; furthermore, there are experimental data\nsuggesting that chronic and acute exposure to cigarette smoking have different effects on\nACE2 expression [49].\nA retrospective study that compared computed tomodensitometry data between\n77 long COVID patients and matched controls reported an approximately 10% decrease\nin lung volume among COVID-19 patients in the absence of clear lung lesions. The\nauthors advance the hypothesis of microﬁbrotic lesions, possibly linked to prolonged\ninﬂammatory changes [50]. This inﬂammatory hypothesis is supported by other work [51]\nreporting transfer impairment as the most frequent anomaly and identifying three risk\nfactors: age, disease severity and intensity of systemic inﬂammation. There are convincing\ndata supporting smoking as an independent risk factor for the persistence of chest X-ray\nanomalies at 12 weeks after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least some subgroups of\nhospitalized patients [37].\nLung ﬁbrosis following pulmonary viral infection is a well-known phenomenon. A\nvariable degree of ﬁbrosis is common; a literature review [52] that included 2018 COVID-\n19 survivors from 6 studies reported a 44.9% prevalence of ﬁbrotic lesions and found\nan association with coughing, dyspnea, chest pain, myalgia, and fatigue. The authors\nidentiﬁed a series of prognostic factors: computed tomography scores over 18, admission to\nintensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Somewhat counter-intuitively, COPD is reported\nas a risk factor, while smoking was not found to have a signiﬁcant impact. Similarly, a\nstudy aimed at identifying risk factors for developing post-COVID-19 lung ﬁbrosis, which\nfollowed 387 patients [53], found no signiﬁcant role for smoking but found signiﬁcant roles\nfor male gender, need for ventilatory support, persistent breathlessness, and high levels of\ncytokine-storm markers. The processes underlying of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung ﬁbrosis\nare not completely understood, but imbalances of the renin–angiotensin system [54] and\nJ. Pers. Med. 2024, 14, 97\n8 of 15\nlow levels of circulating interferon gamma [55] have been reported as potentially relevant\nto ﬁbrosis following COVID-19. Smoking is known to have similar effects [56] but also has\na variable effect [57] on the transforming growth factor pathway [58], which is central to\nﬁbroblast proliferation and collagen production. However, smaller studies have found a\npotential negative effect of smoking on post-COVID-19 lung ﬁbrosis [59]. This effect may\nreﬂect an indirect inﬂuence, as smoking and asthma were good predictors of severe disease\nand the need for mechanical ventilation.\nMuscle mass and capacity are increasingly used as survival predictors of chronic\ncardiovascular and respiratory obstructive disorders; respiratory-muscle dysfunction may\npartially explain the restrictive respiratory patterns reported in COVID-19 patients [60].\nA metanalysis and literature review attempting to characterize sarcopenia as a risk factor\namong older adults [61] found a plethora of demographic, socio-economic, and morbid\nconditions, many of which also been identiﬁed as risk factors for long COVID. A cross-\nsectional study on the body composition of 711 COVID patients reported associations\nbetween dynapenia and sarcopenia and lower lung function [62]. The association between\nsarcopenia and smoking is well known [63], as extensive data have been collected from\nCOPD patients [64]; the underlying mechanisms are complex and incompletely elucidated,\nbut a role has been postulated for systemic inﬂammation—TNF alpha, IL1, IL6, and C-\nreactive protein have been investigated in this context [65].\nConsidering the available evidence, one may assume that at least some of the respi-\nratory manifestations of long COVID are consequences of multiple pathophysiological\nalterations, including but probably not limited to restrictive ventilatory defects in the con-\ntext of ﬁbrotic lesions of variable severity that developed as a consequence of prolonged\ninﬂammation and that are potentially aggravated by respiratory muscle disfunction. Smok-\ning has a well-known role in prolonging and aggravating inﬂammatory events, and this\nrole may be partially explained by the nicotine–ACE2 interaction. Setting nicotine aside,\nthere are limited data concerning the role of the over 2500 known components of tobacco\nsmoke in COVID pathogenesis.\nAlong the same line, dyspnea and fatigability may reﬂect multisystemic involvement\n(typically respiratory and cardiovascular involvement), as the empiric data suggests. For\nexample, one study including 89 COVID-19 patients reported associations between long-\nterm pulmonary dysfunction and age, hypertension, and insulin resistance. This study also\nidentiﬁes relevant biological changes, such as high platelet counts and CXCL9 levels [66].\nCXCL9 is a cytokine involved in chemotaxis and lymphocytic migration and has also been\ninvestigated as a potential biomarker of heart failure [67]. CXCL9 has been reported to be\nupregulated in long-term smokers and ex-smokers [68]. This association may underline\na link between smoking and respiratory manifestations of long COVID, such as dyspnea\nand fatigue.\nWhile cardiovascular impairment may explain some symptoms, such as dyspnea or\nfatigue, new-onset cardiovascular disease was clearly linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection [69],\nand persistence after 12 weeks is not uncommon. Furthermore, there are published data\nsuggesting an association between smoking and long COVID-related hypertension and\ntachycardia [16]. Results from a Polish cohort included increased arterial stiffness in\nCOVID-19 convalescents [70], an effect that persisted after controlling for age, sex, body\nmass index, diabetes and smoking; it is to be expected that smoking in this case will have\nan additive effect.\nAlthough smoking is known to have a deleterious effect on smell and taste capabili-\nties [71], there are reports suggesting no effect on similar deﬁciencies related to long COVID.\nTwo small cohorts [23] of previously hospitalized patients found no signiﬁcant impact\nof smoking on the risk of developing such symptoms [38], and a larger study found that\nsmoking, male gender and a history of intensive care were correlated with an increased\nrisk of developing dysgeusia [33]. Such contradictory results are difﬁcult to reconcile, but\nvariability in ACE2 expression on the upper-respiratory-tract mucosa may explain the dif-\nferences: it is lower in younger [72] and female subjects, which are the main demographics\nJ. Pers. Med. 2024, 14, 97\n9 of 15\nassociated with better outcomes for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and which are less likely\nto be found in a hospitalized cohort.\nRegarding cognitive impairment, data from a retrospective Swiss cohort of outpatients\n(with mild and moderate forms of COVID-19) suggest that more than half of SARS-CoV-2-\npositive patients reported persistent cognitive symptoms up to 10 months after the acute\ninfection. Speciﬁcally, smoking seems to be signiﬁcantly related to memory impairment [9].\nA study that included 54 post-COVID-19 patients with mild neurocognitive impair-\nment [73] found signiﬁcantly decreased serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor\n(BDNF) compared with healthy controls. Smoking, or at least nicotine exposure, has a\nknown effect on the BDNF pathway [74], inﬂuencing serum levels and possibly the expres-\nsion of TrkB receptors. Although smoking is generally associated that smoking with higher\nBDNF levels, recent data show a more nuanced inﬂuence—current heavy smoking [75] and\ntotal number of smoking [76] years seem particularly important, while light smoking has\nno signiﬁcant inductive effect.\nVarious, non-mutual, exclusive mechanisms have been investigated to explain long\nCOVID manifestations. These mechanisms include viral persistence, immune abnormality,\nvascular anomalies and autonomic dysregulation. At least for neurological complaints, the\navailable published data seem contradictory; some authors have suggested the possibility\nof viral persistence in neuronal structures [77], while a study on 25 patients with post-\nCOVID-19 cognitive symptoms [78] found no evidence of persistent viral components or\ninﬂammatory markers in cerebrospinal ﬂuid or serum.\nSome neurological manifestations of long COVID might be explained by reduced\nlevel of serotonin; a recent work [79] explored this hypothesis and postulated a role for\ninterferon-driven inﬂammation, which could act by decreasing tryptophan absorption and\nincreasing serotonin turnover.\nMental-health effects may be difﬁcult to assess in long COVID patients, and the\nunderlying mechanisms are probably complex; there are data suggesting an association\nbetween smoking and sedative use [15] (signiﬁcant for female gender), a relationship\nthat might not be casual but that rather might reﬂect anxious behavior. Furthermore, the\nSARS-CoV-2 epidemic seems to have had an indirect effect on mental health and even\nsomatic symptoms, as was shown in a Greek cohort [80]; similarly, a Turkish transverse\nstudy reported that smoking predicted the levels of anxiety experienced by recovered\nCOVID patients who had been hospitalized (OR 4, 95% CI 1.2–12.5) [36], but the authors\nhypothesize that tobacco use is a coping strategy, rather than a cause. Smoking was found\nto be associated with sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression in a Chinese cohort that\nenrolled previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients [39] one year after their discharge,\nand various mental-health conditions are known to be associated with chronic respiratory\ndiseases [81].\nImmune dysregulation has also been discussed as a potential underlying mechanism\nfor persistent COVID-19 symptoms—a hypothesis supported by compelling data showing\na higher incidence of autoimmune disorders [82] following the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.\nThere is no easy way to explore the potential inﬂuence of smoking on complex immune\nresponses, as many effects of nicotine are dose-dependent [83], but empiric data show\nweaker antibody responses in smoking patients [84] and possibly an increased probability\nof subsequent reinfections [85].\nThe analysis of published results encountered some methodological limitations: the\nmajority of published studies use a dichotomic (sometimes three-layered) stratiﬁcation,\nwith smoker/ex-smoker and non-smoker categories; additionally, loosely deﬁned terms\nsuch as “light smoking” or “current smoker” are sometimes utilized; ﬁnally, there generally\nseems to be no data available on the intensity of tobacco consumption (expressed as pack-\nyears or otherwise).\nAdditionally, social and economic status, cultural characteristics, and mental state are\na few factors that may function as confounders of the role of smoking in long COVID.\nJ. Pers. Med. 2024, 14, 97\n10 of 15\nThe majority of the studies analyzed have retrospective designs, which limits their\npower and scope. This limitation was to be expected, given the chronic nature of long\nCOVID. Some of the data were obtained by telephone surveys and various self-reporting\ntools, an approach that may introduce reporting bias. The broad deﬁnition of long COVID\nmay also lead to overdiagnosis, as some symptoms are not speciﬁc and the criterion that\nsymptoms ‘should not be explained by other chronic or intercurrent disorders’ (according\nto the generally accepted deﬁnition of long COVID) might not translate easily to clinical or\nresearch practice, especially when self-reporting or phone surveys are employed.\nAlong this line of reasoning, we may infer that the relationship between smoking\nand the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic does not stop at the clinical level. There are some data\nsuggesting COVID-19 and related social and healthcare policies had a mixed effect on\nsmoking, with some individuals starting or restarting smoking as a coping mechanism\nand policies encouraging quitting or switching to vaping as a potentially less harmful\nalternative [86]. Data from a small Turkish cohort suggest the disease itself may play a role\nas a motivator encouraging smoking cessation and perhaps preventing relapse, especially\nfor patients who believe that smoking has a negative health impact [87]. From the public-\nhealth point of view, policies implemented to manage COVID-19 in South Asia [88] were\nreported to have a positive effect on tobacco and alcohol consumption that differed between\ngenders, a result that may underline the importance of local customs, education levels\nand socio-economic status. On the other hand, a similar report from Greece [89] found no\nsigniﬁcant impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on tobacco usage; such data may support\nthe importance of considering cultural and socio-economic background when assessing\nsmoking on a population level.\nThe relationship between smoking and COVID-19 seems to be complicated and multi-\nfaceted. For example, a British survey of 3179 adults [90] showed that smokers and longtime\nex-smokers were more likely to self-report COVID-19, compared to never smokers. The\nauthors suggest differences in hygiene habits, such as washing hands after smoking or\nvaping, as potential explanations; still, such results underline potential sources of reporting\nbias when self-reporting methods are employed. Along the same line, the authors of a\nTurkish study on chronic COVID-19 symptoms [35] suggest that perceived low social\neconomic status is associated with an increase in reported symptomatology, although the\nunderlying mechanism is not elaborated upon.\nThere are few studies that include recommendations of smoking cessation for long\nCOVID patients. The data may be scant and limited, but given the agreement with general\npublic-health policies, such a recommendation seems like a sensible approach.\nThere is signiﬁcant variability in the incidence of various symptoms associated with\nlong COVID when comparing either percentages or rankings; this variability is probably\nexplained by differences between cohorts, methods of gathering data, timing of assessments,\nand, possibly, differences in the deﬁnitions utilized.\nThere are practically no data that may elucidate the roles of different components of\ntobacco smoke; clinical data makes use of the umbrella term “smoking”, and fundamental\nresearch usually focuses on biological effects of nicotine. With this limitation in mind, we\nalso consider a small number of studies that found similar effects for smoking and vap-\ning [14] and snuff use [24]; this agreement may suggest a central role for nicotine exposure\nas a risk factor for developing long COVID, considering that the chemical composition of\nthese products is otherwise quite different. Future research initiatives might beneﬁt from\nincluding vaping and heated tobacco products in standard data collection, considering the\nsocietal changes in tobacco-related habits.\nThere are some initiatives attempting to address some of these issues and to assess\nlong COVID from a prospective point of view. One such initiative is a recently published\nprotocol [91] attempting to characterize vascular and endothelial anomalies that also\nincludes a systematic tool for the collection of smoking data.\nThis review has some obvious limitations, at least some of which are external and\nlinked to the nature of the condition under study.\nJ. Pers. Med. 2024, 14, 97\n11 of 15\nMore than one label or keyword may be used for the clinical entity under study.\nAlthough both ‘long COVID’ and ‘post acute COVID’ were used as keywords in an attempt\nto be comprehensive, there might nonetheless be papers using a different or alternative\nterminology. This possibility may be relevant especially for early papers published before\nthe terms were coined.\nPost-acute COVID has a clear but general deﬁnition, which may lead to overdiagnosis.\nAdditionally, the intensity and impact of the symptoms are not always reported or available,\nwhich limits the value of intergroup comparisons.\nThe majority of data seem to be either retrospective or generated by bias-prone meth-\nods such as phone surveys or self-reporting of symptoms.\nReported smoking data are frequently limited (ex., no data on total tobacco consump-\ntion or quit time), which makes it difﬁcult to investigate a dose–response relationship.\n5. Conclusions\nThere is compelling evidence to link smoking to an increased risk of developing\npost-acute COVID manifestations.\nThere seems to be a relatively strong association between smoking and some deﬁni-\ntive clinical components of long COVID, mainly respiratory and heart-related issues; the\nassociation with olfactory or taste disturbances seems weak, although selection bias could\nnot be excluded. Smoking probably plays an etiologic role in the underlying physiological\nphenomena of respiratory, cardiovascular, and, possibly, neurological manifestations of\nlong COVID; the relationship between smoking and at least some cognitive or mental-\nhealth-related symptoms may in part be explained by association, rather than causation.\nDespite limited data, recommending smoking cessation as a clinical tool for prevention of\nlong COVID seems to be a reasonable approach.\nAvailable data on long COVID may be biased, given the retrospective nature of\nthe studies and the sometimes vague deﬁnitions utilized; similarly, only limited data on\nsmoking are available. Future research could beneﬁt from using a robust approach to data\ngathering, such as employing standardized deﬁnitions and data types.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.C.T. and A.T.C.; resources, A.C.T., A.T.C., R.A.C.D.,\nD.R.P., O.E.M., L.T. and C.V.; data curation, A.C.T., A.T.C. and I.A.G.-C.; writing—original draft\npreparation, A.T.C.; writing—review and editing, A.C.T., D.R.P. and O.E.M.; visualization, R.A.C.D.\nand L.T.; supervision, A.C.T.

Out of 432 \nstudies,  we identified 13 studies examining the clinical characteristics of a total of 5960 \nhospitalized COVID-19 patients that presented data on the smoking status. No study \nreported e-cigarette use among COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of current \nsmoking ranged from 1.4% to 12.6%. The random effect pooled prevalence of \ncurrent smoking was 6.5% (95%CI: 4.9-8.2%).\nThis preliminary analysis does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk \nfactor for hospitalization for COVID-19. Instead, these consistent observations, which \nare further emphasized by the low prevalence of current smoking among COVID-19 \npatients in the US (1.3%), raises the hypothesis that nicotine may have beneficial \neffects on COVID-19. This could be attributed to its immunomodulatory effects and its \ninteraction with the renin-angiotensin system.

However, the results were remarkably consistent across all studies and \nwere recently verified in the first case series of COVID-19 cases in the US. \nIn conclusion, the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to improve health \nrisk remains valid, but no recommendation can currently be made concerning the \neffects of smoking on the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. No studies recording e-\ncigarette use status among hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified. Thus, no \nrecommendation can be made for e-cigarette users.

SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, nicotine, smoking, hospitalization, electronic \ncigarette.\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nThere is a lot of speculation about the effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019\n(COVID-19). Smoking increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and media reports\nsuggest that it may increase the risk of being infected with acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19.\n \nSARS-CoV-2 is known to use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor\nfor cell entry. There is a complex and unclear interplay between COVID-19 and the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system.1 Until recently, smoking and nicotine were found to\ndown-regulate ACE2 expression  in the lung and other tissues.2,3 More recent analyses\nsuggest that up-regulation of ACE-2 caused by smoking could be detrimental for COVID-\n19.4,5 However experimental data suggest that infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2\nleads to down-regulation of ACE2, and this downregulation is detrimental due to\nuncontrolled ACE and angiotensin II activity.6,7 It has been observed that decreased ACE2\navailability contributes to lung injury and ARDS development.8,9 Therefore, higher ACE2\nexpression, while seemingly paradoxical, may protect against acute lung injury caused by\nCOVID-19.10\n \nChina has a high prevalence of smoking (26.6%), much higher among males (50.5%) than\nfemales (2.1%).11 It was recently suggested that there is no strong evidence between\nsmoking and prevalence of COVID-19 due to the low prevalence of smoking among\nCOVID-19 patients in 2 studies compared to the population smoking prevalence in\nChina.12 The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of current smoking\namong Chinese hospitalized cases with COVID-19 relative to the population prevalence of\ncurrent smoking in China.\n \n \nMethods\nMethods\nA systematic review of the literature was performed by searching for publications on\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, April 3, 2020\nQeios ID: Z69O8A.12   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/Z69O8A.12\n2/10\nPubMed using the terms \"[SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19 OR 2019-nCoV] AND [Clinical OR\nMortality OR Outcome]” in the title or the abstract on April 1. Out of a total of 432\nstudies, 13 studies which included data about the smoking status of hospitalized COVID-\n19 patients were identified.13-25 No study reported e-cigarette use among COVID-19\npatients. The pooled rate of current smoking was calculated by random effect meta-\nanalysis using JASP Version 0.11.1 (JASP Team 2019, University of Amsterdam,\nNetherlands).\n \nResults\nResults\nThe studies examined are presented in T able 1\nT able 1. One study presented the combined\ncurrent and former smoking prevalence, and all were considered current smokers in this\nanalysis.13 Two other studies reported the smoking status as \"history of smoking\" or\n\"smoking\".22,24 While it was unclear if these definitions included both current and former\nsmokers, we analyzed the data assuming they were all current smokers.\n \nFigure\n \nA total of 5960 patients with data on smoking status were presented, with 55.1% being\nmales. Current smoking was reported by a total of 450 patients, with the prevalence\nranging from 1.4% (95%CI: 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95%CI: 10.6-14.6%) across all\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, April 3, 2020\nQeios ID: Z69O8A.12   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/Z69O8A.12\n3/10\nstudies.

The\nrandom effect meta-analysis is presented in Figure 1\nFigure 1.\n \n \nFigure\n \n \nDiscussion\nDiscussion\nThe current study examined for the first time the prevalence of current smoking among\nhospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China. An unusually low prevalence of current\nsmoking among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in China was observed when considering\nthe population smoking prevalence. The pooled prevalence observed in the 13 studies\nanalyzed was approximately 1/4th the population prevalence. Consistently low prevalence\nof current smoking was observed in all studies.\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, April 3, 2020\nQeios ID: Z69O8A.12   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/Z69O8A.12\n4/10\n \nThis preliminary analysis, assuming that the reported data are accurate, does not\nsupport the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-\n19. However, other confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, should be\nconsidered in examining if access of Chinese smokers with COVID-19 to hospital care\nmay be different compared to the non-smoking population. At this time, it is impossible\nto perform a multivariate analysis or examine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection and\nhospitalization according to the smoking status of the whole population. The accuracy of\nthe recorded smoking status also needs to be determined. It is possible that some\npatients may have quit smoking shortly after disease initiation and before admission to\nhospital, and thus would be registered as former smokers. Only 3 of the studies reported\nthe proportion of former smokers among patients, which was particularly low (1.9%,\n3.0% and 5.0%).14,17,20 Another limitation is that differences in smoking prevalence exist\nbetween age groups, particularly considering that hospitalization for COVID-19 may be\nmore likely for older people. A study by Liu et al. reported that the highest smoking\nprevalence in China was observed in males aged 40-59 years.26 The median age in all the\nstudies analyzed herein was < 59 years, with the exception of one subgroup of patients in\na study comparing elderly with young cases.15 Additionally, high smoking prevalence was\nobserved among older Chinese males by Liu et al. Specifically, the prevalence of current\nsmoking in males was: 46.5% in 18-29 years, 57.6% in 30-39 years, 60.3% in 40-49 years,\n59.5% in 50-59 years, 52.2% in 60-69 years and 41.5% in 70+ years. In females, the\nhighest smoking rats were observed in those aged 50 years or higher (4.7-8.7%)\ncompared to younger age groups (1.7-2.6%).26 Thus, it is unlikely that age was a factor\nthat substantially affected the present analysis. Finally, the present analysis examined\nonly hospitalized cases. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn on the susceptibility of\nsmokers to less severe COVID-19 that would not require hospitalization.\n \nThe study also has implications when examining the effect of smoking status on disease\nprogression, complications and death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. One study\nreported that current smoking is associated with higher odds of severe COVID-19.27\nHowever, it is well-established that smokers are more likely than non-smokers to suffer\nfrom comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, which are risk factors for adverse\nCOVID-19 outcomes. It remains unclear whether smoking per se or other factors related\nto comorbidities may be responsible for an adverse outcome.\nConsidering the above-mentioned uncertainties, the generalized advice to quit smoking\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, April 3, 2020\nQeios ID: Z69O8A.12   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/Z69O8A.12\n5/10\nas a measure to improve health risk remains valid, but no recommendation can be\ncurrently made concerning the effects of smoking on the risk of hospitalization for\nCOVID-19. In fact, the consistently low prevalence of current smoking among Chinese\npatients with COVID-19 was further supported by the recent data recently released from\nthe US CDC.28 From a total of 7162 patients in the US, only 1.3% were current smokers.\nlow smoking prevalence was also observed among hospitalized non-ICU (2.1%) and ICU\ncases (1.1%), while the population smoking prevalence in the US is 13.8%. These\nobservations raise a possible hypothesis that nicotine might reduce the risk for severe\nCOVID-19. Hospitalization for COVID-19 will inevitably result in abrupt withdrawal of\nnicotine and its beneficial effect linked to this hypothesis in smokers or users of other\nnicotine products. This could, at least partly, explain the association between smoking\nand COVID-19 severity among hospitalized patients.27 Nicotine has been found to\nprevent acute lung injury in an animal ARDS model and has immunomodulatory\neffects.29,30 There is also evidence for an interaction between nicotine and the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone axis, although such interactions remain unclear.2-5 In any case,\nthe observations of a consistently low prevalence of smoking among COVID-19 cases in\nChina and the US, together with the potential mechanisms through which nicotine\ninteracts with the inflammatory process and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\naxis involved in the development of COVID-19, warrant an urgent investigation of the\nclinical effects of pharmaceutical nicotine on COVID-19 susceptibility, progression and\nseverity. The potential need to provide pharmaceutical nicotine products to smokers who\nexperience an abrupt withdrawal of nicotine when hospitalized for COVID-19 or aim to\nfollow medical advice to quit smoking to relieve underlying conditions that may increase\nvulnerability to serious or fatal symptoms should also be examined.\n \nFinally, an important issue that also needs to be addressed is the effect of e-cigarette\nuse on COVID-19 risk, particularly for Europe and the US where prevalence of use is\nhigher compared to China. No studies recording e-cigarette use status among\nhospitalized COVID-19 patients in China were identified. Thus, no recommendation can\nbe made for e-cigarette users, but all the above-mentioned issues relevant to the\nhypothesis about the effects of nicotine and nicotine withdrawal on COVID-19\nprogression and severity are equally applicable to e-cigarette users.\n \n \nReferences\nReferences\n1.

Smokers are at a higher risk of \ndeveloping COVID-19 and are also at a higher risk of developing \nsevere COVID-19 complications.1 Although there are no data \navailable regarding the benefits of smoking cessation during the \nCOVID-19 epidemic, there is evidence to suggest that smoking \ncessation for 4 weeks or more will lessen the risk of developing \nCOVID-19 as well as the risk of developing severe COVID-19 \ncomplications.\nSmoking and COVID-19: Increased Risk and \nIncreased Complications\nBoth smoking and COVID-19 affect the respiratory system. Smoking \nis known to increase the risk of lung cancer (relative risk [RR] 10.92; \n95% confidence interval [CI] 8.28–14.20), chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease (RR 4.01; 95% CI 3.18–5.05), and asthma (RR \n1.61; 95% CI 1.07–2.42).2 In a study examining respiratory syn-\ncytial virus, a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2, it was shown that cig-\narette smoke causes necrosis of airway epithelial cells and prevents \nviral-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis usually limits viral replication \nand inflammation. However, when it is replaced with necrosis, both \nviral replication and inflammation are enhanced, leading to an in-\ncreased susceptibility of acquiring viral infections.3 Furthermore, \nsmokers often have more hand-to-face movements (compared with \nnonsmokers), making viral transmission more probable.\nSmokers also have an increased risk of developing severe com-\nplications once they become infected with SARS-CoV-2.1 A recent \nsystematic review examined five studies that analyzed the smoking \nstatus of patients during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The \nsize of the patient population in all of these studies ranged from \n41 to 1099 and the studies only included patients who were \nCOVID-19 positive.1 The authors concluded that smokers (com-\npared with nonsmokers) were 1.4 (RR 1.4; 95% CI 0.98–2.00) \ntimes more likely to suffer from severe symptoms of COVID-19. \nThey were also 2.4 (RR 2.4; 95% CI 1.43–4.04) times more likely \nto be placed in the intensive care unit, require mechanical ven-\ntilation, or die.1 Another recent Chinese study published in the \nLancet, compared the incidence of severe COVID-19 symptoms \nin 52 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit. \nComparing smokers to nonsmokers, 26 (81%) versus 9 (45%) \nhad acute respiratory distress syndrome, 30 (94%) versus 7 (35%) \nrequired mechanical ventilation, 15 (29%) had heart failure, and \n12 (23%) had kidney failure.4 Smokers are therefore more likely \nto acquire SARS-CoV-2 and are more likely to have adverse out-\ncomes once the infection is acquired.\nImmediate Benefits of Smoking Cessation\nAlthough there are limited data available, studies from the sur-\ngical literature suggest that even 4 weeks of smoking cessation \nmay decrease the risk of adverse outcomes and intubation asso-\nciated with COVID-19.5 In a study published in the Canadian \nJournal of Anesthesia in 2012, the authors conducted a systematic \nreview and meta-analysis of 25 studies on short-term preoperative \nsmoking cessation and postoperative complications. The authors \nof this study identified that at least 4 weeks of smoking cessation \nlowers the risk of respiratory complications compared with cur-\nrent smokers (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.61–0.96 and RR 0.53; 95% CI \n0.37–0.76).5 In another surgical study examining over 600  000 \nnoncardiac surgical patients, current smokers had a higher like-\nlihood of 30-day mortality (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.11–1.72) and a \nhigher incidence of postoperative complications such as surgical \nsite infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; 95% CI 1.80–2.43), pneu-\nmonia (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.80–2.43), unplanned intubation (OR \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/22/9/1664/5828549 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1665\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2020, Vol. 22, No. 9\n1.87; 95% CI 1.58–2.21), and septic shock (OR 1.55; 95% CI \n1.29–1.87).6 Thus, based on data from the surgical literature, \nthere is reason to conclude that 4 weeks of smoking cessation will \nbe associated with a lower incidence of adverse events and intub-\nation among COVID-19 patients.\nSmoking Cessation\nPhysicians can play a crucial role in helping smokers quit smoking during \nthe COVID-19 epidemic. Physicians can use telemedicine to advise their \npatients regarding smoking cessation and to recommend pharmaco-\ntherapy. In a study published in the Lancet in 2016, varenicline was \nshown to be the most effective pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation \nfollowed by bupropion and the nicotine patch.7 In this 12-week study \nof 8144 participants, patients treated with varenicline had better abstin-\nence rates compared with those on placebo (OR 3.61; 95% CI 3.07–\n4.24), those using the nicotine patch (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.46–1.93), and \nthose using bupropion (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.52–2.01). In addition, par-\nticipants placed on bupropion and the nicotine patch achieved higher \nsmoking cessation rates compared with those on placebo (OR 2.07; \n1.75–2.45 and OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.82–2.54).7 The primary endpoint \nin the study was confirmed smoking cessation for weeks 9–12.7 These \nmedications can be prescribed by the patient’s physician and can be \ndelivered to their homes from the nearest pharmacy. Finally, physicians \nshould also make their patients aware of behavioral therapy hotlines for \nsmoking cessation. The National Cancer Institute offers these services \non their website (smokefree.gov).\nConclusion\nSmoking cessation is likely to reduce the risk of developing COVID-\n19 as well as the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 compli-\ncations. For this reason, physicians should advise their patients to \nstop smoking immediately.\nSupplementary Material\nA Contributorship Form detailing each author’s specific involvement with this \ncontent, as well as any supplementary data, are available online at https://\nacademic.oup.com/ntr.\nFunding\nNone.\nDeclaration of Interests\nNone declared.\nReferences\n\t1.\t Vardavas CI, Nikitara K.

We agree \nwith the Authors and we also believe that smoking has a complex and \nnot yet clear link with COVID-19. We considered 2 cohorts of 601 pa­\ntients from 2 Northern Italian cities (Brescia and Bergamo) most affected \nby the SARS-CoV-2 infection: one concerning patients admitted to our \nhospital in Brescia, and another one concerning non-hospitalized pa­\ntients evaluated at the territorial medicine level in Bergamo. The aim of \nthe study was to assess whether or not there was a correlation between \ncurrent active smoking and severity of COVID-19 disease. 299 consec­\nutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients (M/F = 208 (70%)/ 91(30%) were \nincluded and among these 46 (15%) were current active smokers. The \nmean age was 68.8 years (±11.7). The patients who died as a conse­\nquence of COVID-19 disease were 87 (29%). Table 1 shows that active \nsmoking and COVID-19 are independent variables (p-value = 0.99) in \nour hospitalized patients. Garufi et al. claim that the current available \ndata on the relationship between COVID-19 and smoking only concern \nhospitalized patients [2]. In our study 302 consecutive non-hospitalized \nCOVID-19 patients (M/F = 176 (58.3%) /126 (41.7%) were also \nincluded and among these 92 (30%) were current active smokers. The \nnon-hospitalized patients who died as a result of COVID-19 disease were \n28 (9.3%). The table I shows that current active smoking and COVID-19 \nwere independent variables (p-value = 0.66) also for non-hospitalized \npatients. These data are in line with the results of the study performed \nby Meini et al. and Lippi et al. that reported an unexpectedly low \nprevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 hospitalized patients \n[3,4]. We agree with the Authors and we also found no significant \ncorrelation between active smoking and severity of COVID-19 disease. \nWe believe that our study can add important information about the link \nbetween smoking and COVID-19 in Italian hospitalized and non- \nhospitalized patients too. \nProbably the link between smoking and COVID-19 is not simple and \ndoes not concern a single factor. \nIf it is true that smoking increases the expression of ACE2 receptors \nto which the SARS-Cov-2 attaches, it is equally true that up regulation of \nthis enzyme can decrease the risk of developing serious systemic com­\nplications of coronavirus infection [5,6]. This is due to the fact that \nACE2 converts angiotensin II (ANG II) to Angiotensin 1–7 (ANG 1–7) \nthus decreasing the powerful pro inflammatory effect of ANG II [7,8]. \nOther Authors have confirmed that ACE2 mitigates pro inflammatory \neffects by decreasing the circulating amount of ANG II [9]. Moreover, \nstudies in mice have shown that in smokers there is an upregulation of \nACE2 which protects from the development of the Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS) [10,11]. Consequently, studies have hy­\npothesized that the up-regulation of this enzyme may protect patients \nfrom severe lung damage and that this also occurs in patients with \nCOVID-19 [11]. \nAlthough it seems like a paradox, the latest scientific evidences are in \nfavour of the hypothesis that smoking is not associated with the severity \nof COVID-19 patients. Our case series is interesting because it reports the \ndata of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, confirming the non- \nassociation between smoking and COVID-19 disease. Future studies will \nbe need to confirm this hypothesis and to discover the underlying \npathophysiological mechanisms. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper. \nReferences \n[1] De Bernardis E, Bus`a L.

There has been \nan explosion of COVID-19-related publications, both as pre-\nprints and in peer-reviewed journals.2 Therefore, it is impor-\ntant that evidence is synthesized on specific aspects of the \nepidemiology of COVID-19 for informing existing targeted \npublic health strategies, which may have been impacted by the \ncurrent pandemic. One such determinant is smoking, which \ncauses approximately 8 million deaths each year across the \nglobe before the pandemic.3 Therefore, any potential associa-\ntion between smoking and COVID-19 would be a public \nhealth opportunity for tackling both the current pandemic and \nthe tobacco epidemic toward population health and wellbeing.\nEvidence to date on the potential association between smok-\ning and COVID-19 is patchy and mixed.4-6 In the early days of \nthe pandemic, the evidence available to the global audience was \nmostly from China. The first systematic review on smoking and \nCOVID-19 that was published in March 2020 included 5 stud-\nies – all from China.7 Since then, several systematic reviews were \npublished which included studies mainly from China but were \nmostly preprints.5,6 A rapid “living” systematic review is also \navailable – initially as a pre-print.8 The Lancet has acknowl-\nedged the importance of preprints but reiterated quality.9 A \nrecent review of systematic reviews on smoking and COVID-19 \nhas highlighted several methodological limitations of the sys-\ntematic reviews published to date, such as small sample size, \nselection bias, and the lack of generalisability.10 Therefore, we set \nout to address few of these potential gaps through a comprehen-\nsive literature review of smoking and COVID-19 including only \ncohort studies from settings outside of China which are peer-\nreviewed journal publications in English.\nThe overarching research question was “Are individuals \nwith a smoking history at an increased risk of developing \nSARS-CoV2 infection, COVID-19 disease severity or mortal-\nity compared to those without a smoking history”?\nMethods\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nA search was conducted in the PubMed database for studies \npublished between January 1, 2020, to August 30, 2020. The \nZotero 5.0.85 software was used to manage the selected stud-\nies. A comprehensive search was designed for the purpose of \nthis study (Appendix 1). Only full-text studies were included in \nSmoking and COVID-19: A Literature Review of Cohort \nStudies in Non-Chinese Population Settings\nAoife Rodgers, Manasi Nadkarni, Emilie Kruke Indreberg,  \nLenah Alfallaj and Zubair Kabir\nSchool of Public Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.\nABSTRACT\nBackground: Smoking history and its potential association with COVID-19 has attracted many researchers and the lay public alike. How-\never, the studies published to date have several methodological limitations and are mainly from China. We set out to synthesize evidence on \nsmoking and COVID-19 relationship drawn on cohort studies only which are published in non-Chinese population settings.\nMethod: A systematic literature search was undertaken drawn on predefined eligibility criteria and a comprehensive search strategy fol-\nlowing the PRISMA guideline between January 2020 and August 2020, excluding preprints and gray literature. Three specific outcomes \nwere examined: smoking history, SARS-CoV2 infection, and COVID-19 severity.\nResults: Of an eligible 40 full-text studies, 7 cohort studies outside of China were finally included in this literature review through inde-\npendent reviewing. Four studies were from the UK, 2 from the United States, and 1 from Turkey. The sample size ranged from 200 to more \nthan 5000 participants. The findings broadly point to 1 direction, a higher smoking prevalence and an increased risk of smoking history on \nboth SARS-CoV2 infection and on COVID-19 severity.\nConclusion: A smoking history (either current or past) seems to negatively impact both SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 severity. \nHowever, such an observation strengthens the argument to continue smoking cessation efforts both for individuals and for the general popu-\nlation health and well-being.\nKeywords: Smoking, COVID-19, severity, review: prospective\nRECEIVED: June 27, 2020.

The studies identified by this search \nwere further analyzed for their eligibility. Study characteristics \nof the selected studies (n = 8) are shown in Table 1. The \nPRISMA flowchart is available as Figure 1.\nNarrative synthesis of evidence\nThe final number of cohort studies (both prospective and ret-\nrospective) included for narrative synthesis were 7 (all outside \nof China). Depending on the outcome of each study, the data \npresented in Table 2 reflects the heterogeneity of each study. \nThe 3 outcomes presented for the exposure of interest (a smok-\ning history – either a former smoker or a current smoker, as \ndefined in each study) were: (1) smoking prevalence by sub-\ngroups; (2) severity of SARS-CoV2 infection (as demonstrated \nin each study of being hospitalized); (3) mortality (COVID-\n19-related deaths). If information on gender is available in any \nof the studies related to the above 3 outcomes, Table 2 also \ncaptures this. No quality appraisal was undertaken because of \nthe nature of this literature review.\nResults\nA comprehensive search of PubMed between January 1, 2020 \nand August 30, 2020 yielded 40 peer-reviewed publications in \nnon-Chinese population settings in alignment with our eligi-\nbility criteria of including only cohort studies. Of these 40 eli-\ngible, only 7 were finally included following full-text reviewing \nby 2 independent reviewers (AF & MN), and any conflicts \nwere resolved by a third reviewer (ZK).\nTwo of these 7 studies were from the United States,11,15 1 \nfrom Turkey14 and the remaining 4 were from the United \nKingdom.12-16,17 The sample populations in all these 7 studies \nwere individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 from a \ntarget population. The population sample ranged from 200 \n(Bronx, US) to 502,640 (UK) patients.

We also \nreport adjusted odds ratios where available.\nJehi et al11 in the US of 4536 patients reported significant \nhigher smoking rates (P < .001) among those hospitalized \n(n = 958) across 2 cohorts (development and validation) – 8.6% \nwere current smokers and 36.4% were former smokers com-\npared to 6.9% and 26.3%, respectively, among those who were \nnot hospitalized.\nLassele et  al12 in England studying 428,494 individuals \nusing the UK Biobank study reported a similar trend as Jehi \net  al study: significantly higher smoking rates among those \nhospitalized (n = 900) compared to those not hospitalized \n(n = 427,594), 41.9% former smokers and 11.4% current smok-\ners as against 34.6% former and 10% current smokers, respec-\ntively. The same study reported significantly higher odds of \nhospitalizations among former and current smokers compared \nto non-smokers (1.30; 95% CI:1.10-1.55 and 1.25; 95% CI: \n0.96-1.62), respectively, following multivariable regression.\nAnother UK Biobank Study (McQueenie et al13) reported \nsmoking prevalence among those who tested COVID-19 posi-\ntive (n = 1324) and those who tested negative or were not tested \n(n = 426,875), 51% were ever smokers (current and former \ncombined) as against 44.6% among those who were negative, \nrespectively. The same study also reported that ever-smokers \nhad an increased risk of testing COVID-19 positive in indi-\nviduals with no multimorbidity (1.26; 95% CI: 1.02-1.57) in \nthe multivariable analysis.\nA retrospective cohort study in Istanbul,14 Turkey of 611 \nin-patents (Şenkal et al) reported a higher smoking rate (13%) \namong those defined as severe as compared to those who were \ncategorized as “non-severe” (11%), and this was not significant \n(P = 0.56).\nThe smallest study (Palaiodimos et  al15) in this review \n(n = 200) of all COVID-19 in-patients from Bronx, New \nYork reported an ever-smoking rate of 32.5%, which is cer-\ntainly higher than the smoking rate in general population of \nNew York City. The same study reported in the univariate \nanalyses that ever-smokers had higher odds of in-patient \nmortality (1.19; 95% CI: 0.60-2.36) but in multivariable \nanalyses ever-smoking was found to be protective of in-\npatient mortality (0.83; 95% CI: 0.37-1.87) albeit not a sig-\nnificant association. However, this study showed that \nCOVID-19 in-patients who were ever-smoking had an \nincreased odds of oxygen requirements in a multivariable \nanalysis (2.10; 95% CI:1.07-4.10).\nAnother UK Biobank study16 of 7099 participants (Raisi-\nEstabragh et al) reported that 1439 tested COVID-19 positive. \nOf these, 50.9% were ever-smokers compared to 51.8% ever-\nsmokers among those who tested negative. The same study \nreported a higher odds (1.26; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.40) of testing \nCOVID-19 positive among ever-smokers when compared to \nthose who were COVID-19 test negative and were not tested \n(n = 494,838) in the multivariable analyses, but did not reach \nstatistical significance when the untested populations were \nexcluded from the model (1.02; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.15).\nThe largest study17 in this review included 502,640 partici-\npants from the UK Biobank (Woolford et al). 4510 of the par-\nticipants were tested for COVID-19 and 1326 tested positive. \n40% of those who tested positive were former smokers as \nopposed to 37.8% among those who tested negative. However, \n11% were currently smoking among those who tested positive \nas against 14% among those who tested negative. All these \nfindings were significant when compared with the background \npopulation (P < .001).\nIn summary, all the 7 studies included show an apparent \nhigher risk of COVID-19 among the ever-smoking popula-\ntion, and more pronounced among former smokers.\nDiscussion\nThis review of cohort studies outside of China examining the \nrelationship of smoking and COVID-19 is an explorative nar-\nrative synthesis following a systematic approach, with prede-\nfined eligibility criteria and search strategy. The conclusion \nacross all these 7 studies are broadly in the same direction, \npointing toward a potential harmful effect of smoking on \nCOVID-19 severity and being more susceptible to contracting \nSARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the observation of an \nincreased risk of COVID-19 among former smokers is intrigu-\ning. This observation is consistent across several studies both \nincluded in this review and few of those which did not qualify \nfor this review.18,19 This observation needs careful attention \nand deeper exploration, especially related to timing of quitting \nsmoking, because it is probable that those smokers with mor-\nbid conditions could have quit smoking once they were diag-\nnosed with COVID-19.\nSome of the strengths of this review include the robustness \nof eligibility criteria of not including pre-prints and to include \nonly cohort studies. Pre-defined eligibility criteria and a com-\nprehensive search strategy also lends support to the rigor of this \nreview. A systematic approach to include studies outside of \nChinese population settings may add to the strength of this \nreview for several reasons. First, a systematic review of initial 5 \nChinese studies have already been published in March 2020.7 \nSecond, several systematic reviews post this first systematic \nreview have also been published, majority of these reviews \ndid include studies from China and were preprints.5,6 Third, \nthe evolution and the epidemiology of COVID-19 adds to the \ncomplexity of reproducibility – and this was evident from the \nstudies published in the initial stage of the pandemic which \nwere mainly from Chinese hospitals and had small population \nsample.7 Therefore, these initial studies from China and else-\nwhere were either cross-sectional or hospital-based and were \nmethodologically weak: selection bias, the lack of generaliza-\nbility, confounding, and relatively of small sample size. We \naimed to address these limitations in our current review by \nincluding only cohort studies.\nRodgers et al\t\n5\nOur review has some methodological limitations. We did \nnot undertake a systematic review or a meta-analysis because of \nthe heterogeneity of the papers. Our limit to only published \npeer-reviewed literature instead of including gray literature \nmay have influenced our search strategy. We searched only 1 \ndatabase, the PubMed, which is otherwise considered one of \nthe most comprehensive peer-reviewed medical literature data-\nbases to date. Finally, not all studies included in this review had \nall the parameters that we were interested in examining. \nExamples include, self-reported smoking history (some had no \nspecific distinction between current and former smokers), the \nlack of adjusted estimates for the specific outcomes of interest, \nno gender breakdowns, no unified operational definition of \n“severity” of COVID-19 across the studies reviewed, and the \ninability to capture “infectiousness” of SARS-CoV2 owing to \nthe nature of the currently COVID-19 diagnostic tests widely \nemployed across these countries. All these methodologically \ninherent limitations need to be addressed in future research to \ninfer a more concrete conclusion on smoking and COVID-19 \nprogression.\nFurthermore, the epidemiology and the natural history of \nthis pandemic is evolving. Therefore, it would be premature to \nspeculate on the probable causal mechanism of this observation \nbetween a smoking history and SARS-CoV2 infection and its \nsequelae. Several potential mechanisms have been postulated, \nespecially in relation to upregulation of ACE2 receptors and \nsmoking, and also the role of nicotine on anti-cholinergic path-\nway.20,21 However, the totality of evidence in terms of the global \ntobacco epidemic remains unaltered, smoking kills 8 million \nindividuals every year globally, and any additional attribution of \nsmoking to SARS-CoV2 infection quite naturally will increase \nthe burden on the current pandemic. Therefore, smoking ces-\nsation and avoidance of secondhand smoke exposure must \nremain the cornerstone of population health and well-being, \ndespite the lingering uncertainty.\nEthical Considerations\nNo personal data were used, therefore no ethical approval was \nsought\nReferences\n\t 1.\t\nSchiffmann A.

Age and certain underlying health conditions are considered to be detrimental \nfor disease outcomes. The World Health Organisation associated smoking \nwith an adverse progression of the disease and called on smokers to quitting \nsmoking. However, a review of 174 cohort studies revealed an unexpected low \nnumber of current smokers among subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections1. \nThe prevalence of current smokers suffering from symptomatic COVID-19 was \nfrequently significantly lower than in the general population. Current smokers \nwere at reduced risk of being tested positive compared to former smokers and \nnever smokers, which might have been caused by different testing frequencies, \nbut were at higher risk for severe symptomatic COVID-191. This low prevalence \nof current smokers among COVID-19 patients led to the hypothesis that smoking/\nnicotine uptake might have a preventive effect2,3. Research was initiated on the \ninterrelation of nicotine, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and SARS-CoV-2 \ninfections. Amongst others, the downregulation of the expression of angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as well as an inhibitory effect on the production \nof pro-inflammatory cytokines were identified as potential effects of exposure \nto nicotine. This is difficult to understand seeing that other studies found an \nincreased expression of ACE-2 in smokers, the entrance gate of the coronavirus \ninto human cells4,5. In the evaluation of the cohort studies, little attention was \ngiven to the possibility that the use of the proportion of smokers in the general \npopulation as a reference for deriving prevalence ratios to study the association \nof smoking with COVID-19 disease outcomes may be inappropriate. Prevalence \ndata for smoking and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease) reported in 25 studies, which partially identified \na potentially beneficial effect of smoking/nicotine intake, were re-analysed to \ninvestigate the relationship between symptomatic COVID-19 and national \nsmoking prevalence taking account of known risk factors associated with the \ndisease (Supplementary file)6. The limited agreement of the prevalence of those \nrisk factors in the general population with the cohort data demonstrates indirectly \nthat these patients most likely do not reflect the health status of the general \npopulation. In the absence of specifically designed studies, any hypothesis on the \neffect of smoking/nicotine uptake on symptomatic COVID-19 remains speculative. \nThe number of potentially confounding variables would require a multivariate \nstatistical approach and large cohort sizes for providing clarity on the significance \nof potential effects. However, the structure of the published aggregated data \npermits only univariate approaches. As such, the hypothesis of a potentially \nprotective effect of smoking/nicotine uptake on symptomatic COVID-19 cannot \nbe verified.\nAFFILIATION\n1 European Commission, Joint \nResearch Centre (JRC), Geel, \nBelgium\nCORRESPONDENCE TO\nThomas Wenzl.

Understanding smokers’ re-\nsponses to the pandemic will help assess its public health\nimpact and inform future public health and provider mes-\nsages to smokers.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess risk perceptions and change in\ntobacco use among current and former smokers during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in May–July\n2020 (55% response rate)\nPARTICIPANTS: 694 current and former daily smokers\n(mean age 53, 40% male, 78% white) who had been hos-\npitalized pre-COVID-19 and enrolled into a smoking ces-\nsation clinical trial at hospitals in Massachusetts, Penn-\nsylvania, and Tennessee.\nMAIN MEASURES: Perceived risk of COVID-19 due to\ntobacco use; changes in tobacco consumption and inter-\nest in quitting tobacco use; self-reported quitting and\nrelapse since January 2020.\nKEY RESULTS: 68% (95% CI, 65–72%) of respondents\nbelieved that smoking increases the risk of contracting\nCOVID-19 or having a more severe case. In adjusted anal-\nyses, perceived risk was higher in Massachusetts where\nCOVID-19 had already surged than in Pennsylvania and\nTennessee which were pre-surge during survey adminis-\ntration (AOR 1.56, 95% CI, 1.07–2.28). Higher perceived\nCOVID-19 risk was associated with increased interest in\nquitting smoking (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01–2.92). During\nthe pandemic, 32% (95% CI, 27–37%) of smokers in-\ncreased, 37% (95% CI, 33–42%) decreased, and 31%\n(95% CI, 26–35%) did not change their cigarette con-\nsumption. Increased smoking was associated with higher\nperceived stress (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16–1.91). Overall,\n11% (95% CI, 8–14%) of respondents who smoked in\nJanuary 2020 (pre-COVID-19) had quit smoking at sur-\nvey (mean, 6 months later) while 28% (95% CI, 22–34%) of\nformer smokers relapsed. Higher perceived COVID-19\nrisk was associated with higher odds of quitting and lower\nodds of relapse.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most smokers believed that smoking in-\ncreased COVID-19 risk. Smokers’ responses to the pan-\ndemic varied, with increased smoking related to stress\nand increased quitting associated with perceived\nCOVID-19 vulnerability.\nKEY WORDS: cigarette smoking; electronic cigarettes; COVID-19; risk\nperceptions.\nJ Gen Intern Med 36(12):3786–93\nDOI: 10.1007/s11606-021-06913-3\n© Society of General Internal Medicine 2021\nINTRODUCTION\nCigarette smoking is a potentially modifiable risk factor\nassociated with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\namong individuals infected with the severe acute respi-\nratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2),1–6\nunderscoring the public health priority of addressing\ntobacco use, already the leading preventable cause of\ndeath worldwide, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data\non cigarette smoking behaviors in the USA during the\npandemic are needed to assess the full public health\nimpact of the pandemic and to inform public education\nand tobacco cessation efforts.\nCOVID-19 may have positively or negatively altered to-\nbacco users’ perceptions of the risk of smoking, interest in\nquitting, actions to quit, or amount of tobacco used. For\nexample, if smokers feel vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their\ntobacco product use, they may be more interested in reducing\nor quitting.7, 8 Restrictions on social gatherings might discour-\nage tobacco use by offering fewer cues or opportunities to\nsmoke. Alternatively, sheltering at home might facilitate to-\nbacco use in homes where smoking is allowed or other\nsmokers are present. Finally, stress due to the pandemic might\nincrease cigarette smoking.8, 9 Historically, stress-provoking\nPrior Presentations: An abstract of this work was presented as an oral\npresentation at the 2021 virtual Annual Meeting of the Society for Research\non Nicotine and Tobacco, February 2021.\nReceived March 8, 2021\nAccepted May 4, 2021\nPublished online June 7, 2021\n3786\nevents with national or global impact, such as the 9/11 attacks,\nhave been linked to greater tobacco use.10,11\nThe current study investigated whether cigarette smokers’\nself-reported health risk perceptions, motivation to quit, and\namount of tobacco use changed during the early months of the\nUS COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a survey of previ-\nously hospitalized cigarette smokers who had sought to quit\nand received a cessation intervention after discharge as part of\na clinical trial. As individuals who had undergone a recent\nmajor health event that prompted an effort to stop smoking,\nstudy participants were a vulnerable group in whom tobacco\nuse might be in flux and for whom smoking cessation would\nbe especially impactful.\nMETHODS\nDesign\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of individuals enrolled\nin the Helping HAND 4 (HH4) study (NCT03603496), a\ngeographically diverse three-site randomized clinical trial\ncomparing the effectiveness of two smoking cessation inter-\nventions for hospitalized smokers who were being discharged\nand planned to quit smoking. The interventions lasted for 3\nmonths and follow-up continued for 6 months after hospital\ndischarge (study protocol previously described).12 Both the\nparent HH4 study and the COVID-19 supplemental survey\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each\nparticipating institution. The supplemental survey was admin-\nistered from May 18–July 16, 2020, which was between 2 and\n20 months after parent study enrollment.\nParticipants\nParticipants in the HH4 trial were recruited from inpatient\nunits of three hospitals in Boston, MA; Pittsburgh, PA; and\nNashville, TN. Participants were ≥18-year-old, English-\nspeaking daily cigarette smokers who planned to quit smoking\nand agreed to accept a prescription for nicotine replacement\ntherapy at discharge. Patients were excluded if they were\nunable to provide informed consent due to psychiatric or\ncognitive impairment, medically unstable, or lacked reliable\ntelephone access.\nEnrollment\nThe parent study completed enrollment of 1409 participants\nbefore the current study began. We attempted to contact all\nparent study participants, excluding those who had died\n(n=40), withdrawn from further study participation (n=45),\nor lacked valid contact information (n=67). Of 1257 remaining\nparent study participants, 1021 had given consent to receive\nunencrypted text messages and were sent up to 5 messages\nlinked to an online survey using Research Electronic Data\nCapture (REDCap),13 followed by 2 phone calls to administer\nthe survey.

Partic-\nipants received $20 for survey completion.\nMeasures\nCOVID-19-Related Measures.\nCOVID-19 Testing, Infection, or Exposure. Respondents\nwere asked whether they had been tested for COVID-19, had\na positive test, had a health care provider tell them they had\nCOVID-19, believed that they had ever had COVID-19, and\nhad a household member or close contact infected with\nCOVID-19. For analysis, we created a composite measure\n(COVID-19 exposure/illness) that included respondents who\nreported any of these events.\nPerceived Tobacco-Related COVID-19 Risk. Respondents\nwere asked 2 questions about their perception of a smoker’s\nrisk of COVID-19: (1) “To what extent, if any, do you believe\nthat continued smoking affects the risk of getting infected with\ncoronavirus or having a more severe case?” (5-point Likert\nscale, from “definitely increases the risk” to “definitely re-\nduces the risk”); (2) “In your opinion, does reducing or stop-\nping smoking lower the risk of getting coronavirus or a more\nserious case?” (yes/no).\nTobacco Product Use. Questions about changes in\nsmoking behavior and interest in quitting due to\nCOVID-19 were asked only of respondents who report-\ned that they were smoking cigarettes in January 2020,\nbefore the US COVID-19 pandemic: (1) “Has your\ninterest in reducing or stopping smoking changed since\nthe COVID-19 pandemic started?” (no change, in-\ncreased, decreased) and (2) “Has the amount you smoke\nchanged since the COVID-19 pandemic started?” (no\nchange, increased, decreased but still smoking, stopped\nsmoking entirely). We also assessed the proportion of\ncurrent smokers who reported that they quit between\nJanuary 2020 and the survey administration (5–7 months\nlater) and the proportion of nonsmokers who reported\nrelapsing during the same period.\nRespondents who reported a change in the amount\nsmoked were asked if any of 8 factors led to the\nchange: change in cravings/urge, change in ability to\nbuy cigarettes, change in daily routine facilitating or\nhindering smoking, worry or stress related to stay-at-\nhome restrictions, worry or stress related to other as-\npects of the COVID-19 pandemic, wanting to stay\nhealthy, fear of getting or spreading the coronavirus,\nand desire or need to save money.\nCovariates. Demographics (age, sex, education level,\nrace/ethnicity), study site, date of enrollment in the parent\nstudy, years smoked, and cigarettes per day prior to the\nindex hospital admission were obtained from the baseline\n3787\nRigotti et al.: Cigarette Smoking During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJGIM\nsurvey completed at the parent study enrollment. All other\ncovariates were assessed at the time of supplemental COVID-\n19 survey.\nCurrent Tobacco Use. Respondents were asked about past 7-\nday use of cigarettes and nicotine-containing e-cigarettes.\nStress. Respondents were asked to rate their overall level of\nstress on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = little or none and 5 =\nthe most stress I’ve ever had.\nFinancial Status. Worry about financial problems was\nassessed using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = no worry to 5 =\nthe most worry I’ve ever had). One question asked whether the\npandemic had affected income. Three questions from\nVeenstra14 asked about specific financial burdens.\nStatistical Analysis\nResponse options for COVID-19 Likert scale smoking ques-\ntions were dichotomized or trichotomized based on frequency\ndistributions. The outcome measures for cigarette smokers\nwere as follows: (1) perceived COVID-19 risk due to\nsmoking; (2) change in interest in reducing or quitting\nsmoking from January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) to survey com-\npletion; (3) change in amount smoked during that interval; and\n(4) quitting or relapsing during that interval.\nUnivariate analyses examined associations between\neach of the COVID-19-related outcome measures and\nall covariates, including demographics, study site, cur-\nrent tobacco use, composite measure of COVID-19 ex-\nposure/illness, financial worry, and overall stress. Multi-\nple logistic regression models for each outcome were\nconstructed; terms included age, gender, race, education,\nhistory of COVID-19 exposure/illness, study arm, time\nsince study enrollment, and any other variables with a\nunivariate association of p≤.10 with the outcome mea-\nsure. Significance was set at a two-sided p≤.05. All\nanalyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS In-\nstitute, Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nParticipant Characteristics\nOf 1257 participants available for this study, 694 (55%\nresponse rate) completed the supplemental survey. Re-\nspondents and non-respondents differed slightly in age\nand gender but not in race or cigarettes per day. At\nenrollment into the parent study a mean of 12±5 (SD)\nmonths earlier, respondents (vs. non-respondents) had an\naverage age of 52±12 years (vs. 50±13, p=.004), were\n60% female (vs. 51%, p=.002), were 78% non-Hispanic\nwhite and 14% non-Hispanic black (vs. 78% and 16%,\nrespectively, p=.84), and smoked an average of 16±11\ncigarettes daily (vs. 17±11, p=.14). At the time of the\nsurvey administration (May 18–July 16, 2020), 457 of\nrespondents (66%) reported past 7-day cigarette\nsmoking, 46 (6%) reported past 7-day e-cigarette use,\nTable 1 Characteristics of the Survey Respondents (n=694)\nn\n%\nCollected at enrollment in the Helping HAND 4 studya\nAge (mean years, SD)b\n52 (±12)\nSex (n, %)b\nMale\n280\n40\nFemale\n414\n60\nRace/ethnicity (n, %)b\nWhite non-Hispanic\n543\n78\nBlack non-Hispanic\n98\n14\nHispanic\n42\n6\nOther\n11\n2\nEducation (n, %)b\n≤High school graduation or GED\n368\n53\nSome college\n225\n32\nCollege graduate\n101\n15\nStudy site (n, %)b\nMA\n270\n39\nPA\n183\n26\nTN\n241\n35\nCurrent (past 7-day) cigarette smoker\n694\n100\nYears smokedc (mean, SD)\n35 (± 13)\nCigarettes/dayc (mean, SD)\n16 (± 11)\nCurrent (past 7-day) electronic cigarette user\n46\n7\nCollected at time of COVID-19 survey administration\nTobacco use status (in January 2020, pre-COVID-19)d\nCurrent (past 7-day) cigarette smoker\n427\n62\nCurrent (past 7-day) e-cigarette user\n48\n7\nNeither cigarettes nor e-cigarettes\n238\n34\nDeclined\n12\n2\nTobacco use status (at time of survey during COVID-19)e\nCurrent (past 7-day) cigarette smoker\n457\n66\nCurrent (past 7-day) e-cigarette user\n46\n6\nNeither cigarettes nor e-cigarettes\n214\n31\nDeclined\n7\n1\nCollected at enrollment in the Helping HAND 4 studya\nCOVID-19 history\nTested positive\n5\n<1\nTold by health provider that I had COVID-19\n13\n2\nBelieve I had COVID infection\n63\n9\nHousehold/close contact had COVID-19 infection\n35\n5\nCOVID-19 exposure/illness (any of the four above)\n95\n14\nStress — overall level of stress (mean, SD)f\n3.6 (± 1.2)\nFinancial concerns\nWorry about financial problems (mean, SD)f\n3.4 (±1.4)\nEffect of COVID-19 pandemic on income\nDecreased\n305\n44\nIncreased\n48\n7\nNo change\n317\n46\nDecline to answer\n24\n3\nFinancial hardship due to COVID-19 pandemic\nHad to use savings\n194\n28\nHad to borrow money or take out loan\n172\n25\nCould not make credit card or bill payments\n165\n24\naEnrollment into the parent Helping HAND 4 survey occurred a mean\n(± SD) of 12 ± 5 months before administration of the COVID-19\nsupplemental survey\nbDemographic factors and study site were assessed at enrollment into\nthe parent Helping HAND 4 survey.

At that time,\n427 respondents (62%) reported retrospectively that they\nhad been smoking cigarettes and 48 (7%) reported hav-\ning used e-cigarettes in January 2020 (i.e., pre-COVID-\n19 in the USA). Fourteen percent of respondents report-\ned a past history of COVID-19 exposure or illness.\nRespondents reported substantial levels of overall stress\nand financial concerns.\nPerceived Risk of COVID-19 due to Tobacco\nUse\nSixty-eight percent (95% CI, 65–72%) of respondents\nbelieved that continued smoking definitely might in-\ncrease the risk of a coronavirus infection or of having\na more serious case. Nearly as many (63%, 95% CI,\n59–66%) felt that reducing or stopping smoking would\ndecrease that excess risk (Fig. 1). In multivariable anal-\nyses, the belief that smoking increased COVID-19 risk\nwas more common among respondents at the MA site\nvs. the PA or TN sites (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.56,\n95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–2.28) (Table 2). A\nrespondent’s own experience of COVID-19 illness or\nexposure was not associated with perceived risk of\nCOVID-19 due to smoking. Former smokers were more\nlikely than current smokers to believe that smoking\nincreases COVID-19 risk (AOR 2.35, 95% CI 1.60–\n3.47) and that reducing or quitting smoking reduces\nCOVID-19 risk (AOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.50–3.09).\nInterest in Reducing or Stopping Smoking\nAmong the 427 respondents who were smoking in January\n2020 (i.e., pre-COVID-19 in the USA), 41% (95% CI, 37–\n46%) reported an increased interest in reducing or stopping\nsmoking since the pandemic, while 46% (95% CI, 41–51%)\nreported no change, and 13% (95% CI, 10–16%) reported less\ninterest (Fig. 2). Heightened interest in reducing or quitting\nwas associated with the belief that smoking increases the risk\nof COVID-19 infection or complications (AOR 1.72, 95% CI\n1.01–2.92) and that stopping smoking decreases that risk\n(AOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.10–3.02) (Supplemental Table 1).\nChange in Amount Smoked\nAmong respondents smoking pre-pandemic, 32% (95% CI,\n27–37%) reported that their smoking had increased since the\npandemic began, 31% (95% CI, 26–35%) reported no change,\nand 37% (95% CI, 33–42%) reported decreased smoking\n(including 8% who quit smoking) (Fig. 2). Adjusted odds of\nincreased smoking since COVID-19 were associated with\nhigher overall stress (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16–1.91, per point\non a 5-point scale), female sex (AOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.26–\n3.45), and Hispanic ethnicity (AOR 2.98, 95% CI 1.21–7.37)\n(Table 3).\nAmong those who increased their smoking, reasons cited\nmost often were stress due to stay-at-home restrictions (76%),\nstress for other reasons (66%), a change in daily routine making\nit easier to smoke (62%), greater craving to smoke (46%), and\nfear of getting or spreading the virus (45%) (Supplemental\nFigure 1). In contrast, smokers who decreased their smoking\nmost often cited a general desire to stay healthy (69%), change\nin daily routine making it easier to quit (47%), lower craving to\nsmoke (36%), a need to save money (34%), and fear of getting\nor spreading the virus (25%). Fewer than one-quarter cited\nstress or difficulties obtaining cigarettes.\nSmoking Cessation and Relapse\nOf the 427 respondents who were smoking pre-pandemic, 45\n(11%, 95% CI, 8–14%) reported not smoking when surveyed in\nMay–July 2020 (i.e., 5–7 months later); 43 (10%) neither\nFigure 1 Respondents' perceived risk of COVID-19 illness due to smoking and perceived benefit of quitting smoking on COVID-19 risk.\n3789\nRigotti et al.: Cigarette Smoking During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJGIM\nsmoked nor vaped; and 2 (0.5%) vaped only. Adjusting for age,\nsex, and COVID-19 exposure, the odds of quitting smoking\nduring the pandemic was associated with the belief that smoking\nincreases COVID-19 risk (AOR 2.27, 95% CI, 1.05–4.91).\nOf 258 respondents who were not smoking in January\n2020, 71 (28%, 95% CI, 22–34%) resumed smoking. Relapse\nto smoking was associated with a higher overall stress level\n(AOR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01–1.94) and inversely associated with\nthe belief that smoking increases COVID-19 risk (AOR 0.30,\n95% CI 0.16–0.56) in adjusted analyses.\nDISCUSSION\nThis cross-sectional survey assessed tobacco use and risk\nperceptions in the early months of the US COVID-19 pan-\ndemic among a large group of current and former smokers\nwho had participated in a clinical trial to stop smoking after\nhospitalization. Tobacco users’ response to the pandemic var-\nied. While 41% of smokers reported greater interest in reduc-\ning or quitting, almost one-third of respondents increased their\ncigarette consumption, consistent with reports of increased\nTable 2 Factors Associated with Perceived Risk of Smoking and COVID-19 Infection or Severity.

On\nthe other hand, two-thirds of respondents believed that\nsmoking increased the risk of a COVID-19 infection or com-\nplication. Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 was associat-\ned with a higher odds of interest in reducing or quitting\nsmoking, more self-reported quitting by those respondents\nwho were smokers when the pandemic began in the USA,\nand less relapse to smoking among former smokers. Overall,\n11% of respondents who were smokers in January 2020 had\nquit smoking when surveyed an average of 6 months later, but\n28% of respondents not smoking before the pandemic re-\nsumed smoking during this period.\nSmokers often cite stress as a reason for smoking more or\nreturning to smoking after a quit attempt.9 As we hypothe-\nsized, a higher level of stress was associated with increased\nsmoking and with relapse by former smokers. Further evi-\ndence for the role of stress comes from smokers’ attributions\nof why their smoking behavior increased. The most frequently\nendorsed responses were worry or stress due to either stay-at-\nhome restrictions (76%) or to other aspects of the coronavirus\npandemic (66%). Financial worry was not independently\nassociated with changes in smoking behavior after adjustment\nfor overall stress. A change in routine making it easier to\nsmoke was the only other item endorsed by at least half of\nsmokers. Curiously, neither perceived vulnerability to\nCOVID-19 nor change in smoking behavior was associated\nwith respondents’ personal experiences with COVID-19.\nHowever, the survey was conducted prior to widespread avail-\nability of testing for SARS-Co-V2, and few respondents\n(<15%) reported COVID-19 exposure or infection, limiting\nour statistical power to detect an association.\nAn unexpected observation was that respondents’ belief in\nsmokers’ vulnerability to COVID-19 varied by study site, being\nmore common in MA than in PA or TN even after adjustment\nfor demographic factors and respondents’ COVID-19 history or\nexposure. A possible explanation is geographic differences in\nCOVID-19 infection rates at the time of the survey. COVID-19\nmay have been a more salient threat to respondents in MA, who\nhad experienced a COVID-19 surge just before the survey\nadministration, than in PA or TN where COVID-19 rates were\nmuch lower (Fig. 3). Pre-existing geographic differences in\nsmoking prevalence and tobacco control policies may have also\ncontributed to the difference. MA has a low smoking prevalence\nTable 3 Factors Associated with Smokers Who Increased Smoking After Onset of COVID-19.

Two smaller US surveys also found similar associations\nbetween perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 and interest in\nreducing tobacco use.20, 21 Our finding of stress as an impor-\ntant factor influencing smoking behavior during the pandemic\nis corroborated by Dutch and Australian surveys.22, 23\nEleven percent of respondents who were smokers im-\nmediately before the pandemic reported no longer\nsmoking when surveyed 4–6 months later. We have no\ndata on the pre-pandemic quit rate in the sample. Howev-\ner, English population-based surveys of adults found an\nincrease in the number and success of quit attempts in\nApril 2020 compared to previous months, consistent with\nour findings.24 The 2018 population-based U.S. National\nHealth Interview Survey found that 8% of adults who\nwere smokers 12 months before the survey had quit 1\nyear later.25 However, our sample is not directly compa-\nrable because it was selected for an interest in quitting and\nall participants received smoking cessation treatment as\npart of study protocol. Additionally, respondents who had\nquit for 4–6 months in our study might not have sustained\nabstinence for 12 months.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the cross-sectional\nobservational study design limits the ability to infer causal\nrelationships from observed associations. Second, we measured\nperceived COVID-19 risk with a single question asking both\nabout disease susceptibility and severity. Whether respondents\nwho endorsed this question agreed with both components of\nrisk cannot be determined. Third, the response rate was 55%.\nHowever, in a sensitivity analysis using the propensity score\napproach to match each non-responder to a responder with\nsimilar characteristics, we observed very similar findings in\nour key results when responses from non-responders were\nimputed using the responses from their matched responders.\nFourth, self-efficacy and barriers to quit smoking such as nico-\ntine dependence were not collected during the pandemic, al-\nthough participants’ attributions for their reported change in\nsmoking behavior reflect these barriers. Finally, the survey\nsample was not population-based, limiting generalizability.\nHowever, the sample consists of geographically diverse\nmiddle-aged and older smokers who have had a recent major\nhealth event and sought to quit smoking. This reflects a large\ngroup of US smokers, since more than half of smokers make a\nquit attempt each year and 16 million of the 34 million US\nsmokers have a chronic tobacco-related disease.27, 28 The sam-\nple also resembles many smokers seen by general internists.\nIn summary, this study found that during the early months\nof the US COVID-19 pandemic, most smokers believed that\nsmoking increased their vulnerability to COVID-19 but their\nsubsequent tobacco use varied. While 40% reported reducing\nor quitting smoking, many motivated by perceived vulnerabil-\nity to COVID-19, another third increased their smoking,\nwhich they attributed to pandemic-related stress. Our findings\ncould help public health and health care systems identify\nFigure 3 Daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, March 1–July 31, 2020, in counties in which the 3 study sites are located.

Since its \npublication, a study entitled ‘Cardiovascular Disease, Drug Therapy, and Mortality in Covid-19’ by Mehra et al. has been retracted \nby the New England Journal of Medicine. This version of the Scientific Brief has removed the study from the review. The removal \nof this study from the review does not change the conclusions of the analysis. \n \nBackground \nThe harms of tobacco use are well-established. Tobacco causes 8 million deaths every year from cardiovascular diseases, lung \ndisorders, cancers, diabetes, and hypertension.1 Smoking tobacco is also a known risk factor for severe disease and death from many \nrespiratory infections.2-4 In the COVID-19 pandemic, questions have been asked about clinical outcomes for smokers, and whether \nthey are equally susceptible to infection, and if nicotine has any biological effect on the SAR-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes \nCOVID-19).5-7 At the time of writing, one clinical trial to test the effects of nicotine has been announced, but no trial registration \nrecord was found as of 12 May 2020.  \nThis review therefore assesses the available peer-reviewed literature on the association between smoking and COVID-19, including \n1) risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2; 2) hospitalization with COVID-19; and 3) severity of COVID-19 outcomes amongst \nhospitalized patients such as admission into intensive care units (ICU), use of ventilators and death. \n \nMethods \nA review was conducted on 12 May 2020 on smoking and COVID-19, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and WHO \nGlobal Database. Quantitative primary research on adults or secondary analyses of such studies were included. Individual studies \nincluded in meta-analyses that were not otherwise identified in the search were sought. \nDue to the preliminary nature of the many non-peer-reviewed reports issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, preprint repositories \nwere deliberately excluded from this review. \n \nReview of the evidence \nThirty-four peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were in English. None examined tobacco use and \nthe risk of infection or the risk of hospitalization. A total of 26 observational studies and eight meta-analyses were identified. All \nobservational studies reported the prevalence of smoking amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two meta-analyses reported \npooled prevalence of smoking in hospitalized patients using a subset of these studies (between 6 and 13 studies).  \nEighteen of the 26 observational studies containing data on smoking status by severity of COVID-19 outcomes. Six meta-analyses \nwere identified that examined the association between smoking and severity of COVID-19. Nine of the 18 studies were included in \nthe six meta-analyses of smoking and severity (five to seven studies in each analysis), resulting in 1,604 sets of patient data being \nreported more than once. All data in the six meta-analyses come from patients in China.   \n \nWhat is the risk of smokers being infected by SARS-CoV-2? \nThere are currently no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among smokers. This research \nquestion requires well-designed population-based studies that control for age and relevant underlying risk factors.  \n \nWhat is the risk of smokers being hospitalized for COVID-19?  \nThere are currently no peer-reviewed studies that directly estimate the risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 among smokers. \nHowever, 27 observational studies found that smokers constituted 1.4-18.5% of hospitalized adults.8-32 Two meta-analyses have \nbeen published which pooled the prevalence of smokers in hospitalized patients across studies based in China. The meta-analysis \nby Emami et al.33 analysed data for 2986 patients and found a pooled prevalence of smoking of 7.6% (3.8% -12.4%) while Farsalinos \net al.34 analysed data for 5960 hospitalized patients and found a pooled prevalence of 6.5% (1.4% - 12.6%). \n \nSmoking and COVID-19: Scientific brief \n-2- \nWhat is the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death amongst smokers? \nMeta-analyses: \nZhao et al.35 analysed data from 7 studies (1726 patients) and found a statistically significant association between smoking and \nseverity of COVID-19 outcomes amongst patients (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.0 (95% CI 1.3 – 3.1).  The statistical significance disappeared \nwhen the largest study by Guan et al.13 was removed from the analysis (a sensitivity test to see the impact of a single study on the \nfindings of the meta-analysis). An updated version of this meta-analysis which included an additional study remained significant \nwhen this same sensitivity test was applied however.36 Zheng et al.37 analysed data from 5 studies totalling 1980 patients and found \na statistically significant association between smoking and COVID-19 severity when using a fixed effects model: OR: 2.0 (95% CI \n1.3 – 3.2). Lippi et al.38 analysed data from 5 studies totalling 1399 patients and found a non-significant association between smoking \nand severity.  Guo et al.,39 however, later identified errors in the calculation and concluded that this association was indeed \nstatistically significant (OR 2.2 (95% CI 1.3 – 3.7). Vardavas et al.40 analysed data from 5 studies totalling 1549 patients and \ncalculated a relative risk that indicated a non-significant relationship between smoking and severity of COVID-19. However, the \nsame authors found a statistically significant association between smoking status and primary endpoints of admission to Intensive \nCare Unit (ICU), ventilator use or death.  \nIndividual studies not included in meta-analyses: \nNine studies were not included in any of the meta-analyses identified. One of these studies reported observational data for 7162 \npeople in hospital and outpatient settings in the United States of America but did not include any statistical analysis of association.10 \nAnother study of 323 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, reported a statistically significant association between smoking and \nseverity of disease (OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.2 – 10.2).15 Kozak et al.41 found a statistically significant association between smoking and \nICU admission and mortality amongst 226 patients in Toronto, Canada. The remaining six studies were small case series (ranging \nfrom 11 to 145 people) that reported no statistically significant associations between smoking status and severity of COVID-1,8, 11, \n18, 27, 42 apart from Yu et al.43 who reported on a study of 70 patients a statistically significant OR of 16.1 (95% CI 1.3 – 204.2) in a \nmultivariate analysis examining the association between smoking and the exacerbation of pneumonia after treatment. \n \nLimitations \nHospital based studies that report patient characteristics can suffer from several limitations, including poor data quality. Collecting \nsmoking history is challenging in emergency contexts and severity of disease is often not clearly defined and is inconsistent across \nstudies. Such studies are also prone to significant sampling bias. Characteristics of those who are hospitalized will differ by country \nand context depending on available resources, access to hospitals, clinical protocols and possibly other factors not considered in the \nstudies. Further, most studies did not make statistical adjustments to account for age and other confounding factors. \nWell-designed population-based studies are needed to address questions about the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of \nhospitalization with COVID-19. \nConclusions \nAt the time of this review, the available evidence suggests that smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and death \nin hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Although likely related to severity, there is no evidence to quantify the risk to smokers of \nhospitalization with COVID-19  or of infection by SARS-CoV-2 was found in the peer-reviewed literature. Population-based studies \nare needed to address these questions. \n \nRelated WHO Recommendations \nGiven the well-established harms associated with tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure;2 WHO recommends that tobacco \nusers stop using tobacco. Proven interventions to help users quit include toll-free quit lines, mobile text-messaging cessation \nprogrammes, nicotine replacement therapies and other approved medications.   \n \nReferences \n1.

The WHO has declared \nCOVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to be a public health emergency of \ninternational concern.1 Until effective therapeutics and vaccines \nbecome available, minimising the spread of COVID-19 is a pressing \nglobal challenge. Approximately 80% of infected individuals remain \nasymptomatic or present only with minor symptoms, whereas 15% \nbecome moderately to severely ill with cough and shortness of breath, \nand 5% require intensive care. Elderly people with underlying diseases, \nsuch as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic \nrespiratory disease and malignancies, are at greater risk of developing \nsevere COVID-19. Behavioural measures, such as coughing etiquette, \nhand washing, social distancing and reducing physical contact, are \nrecommended to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, the \neffects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and \nworsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed.\nSmoking is a major risk factor for many respiratory infections, and \ncould also accelerate disease progression in those infected.2 Previous \nstudies have shown that smokers are more likely to contract influenza \nand exhibit more severe symptoms than nonsmokers.3 Additionally, \nwith the previous Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-\nCoV) outbreaks, smoking was reported to be a risk factor for MERS-CoV \ninfection and associated with high mortality.4 The mechanisms by \nwhich smoking increases the risk of worsening pneumonia include \naltered airway architecture, inhibition of airway ciliary clearance and \nreduced immune function.3 \nThere are several reasons why smoking adversely affects the immune \nsystem. First, smoking reduces CD4+ T-cells (helper T-cells), which \npromote antibody production in B-cells and activate killer T-cells to \nattack pathogens. Second, nicotine, a major component in tobacco \nproducts, which promotes the secretion of catecholamines and \ncorticosteroids, could impair immune function and suppress the body’s \nability to combat infections.5,6 Third, nicotine also reportedly inhibits the \nproduction of interleukin-22, which helps suppress lung inflammation \nand repair damaged cells.7 Thus, in COVID-19, as well as in other \ninfectious diseases, the risk of infection and increased disease severity \ncould be higher in smokers. However, although there are reports of age, \nsex and underlying diseases being factors driving SARS-CoV-2 \ntransmission and disease deterioration, few studies have focused on \nthe association with cigarette smoking.\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and limited data \non the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of COVID-19 \npatients are available. However, emerging data appear to indicate an \nincreased risk of infection, morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in \nindividuals with a history of smoking. According to the WHO, the \nmortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 in China is higher among men (4.7%) \nthan women (2.8%), which might reflect the large sex difference in \nsmoking habits in China (52.1% in men and 2.7% in women).8,9 In \nWestern countries, where infection transmission has recently soared, \nsmoking tends to be higher among men, although the sex difference is \nnot as great as in China. The European Centre for Disease Prevention \nand Control (ECDC) reported that COVID-19 deaths were more frequent \namong men; a higher smoking rate in men might be attributable to the \nhigher mortality.10 \nAbstract\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already evolved into a rapidly expanding pandemic. Risk factors for COVID-19, such as \ncardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are all strongly associated with smoking habits. The effects of \ncigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed. Emerging data indicate that smoking \nhistory is the major determinant of worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function. \nThus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as a public health measure to limit the global impact of COVID-19.\nKeywords\nSmoking, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, pandemic\nDisclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\nReceived: 7 April 2020 Accepted: 8 April 2020 Citation: European Cardiology Review 2020;15:e16.

In comparison, only 4.7% of those who had \nnever smoked developed critical outcomes.11 Additionally, the \nproportion of patients with severe symptoms was 21.2% among \ncurrent smokers and 42.9% among past smokers, which was higher \ncompared with those who had never smoked (14.5%).11 In this report, \nthe analysis was just a simple comparison. Usually, past smokers were \nolder than current smokers. Therefore, a high age in past smokers may \ncontribute to their worsening outcomes. \nA small study from China using multivariate analysis identified the \nfollowing four factors as being associated with COVID-19 deterioration: \nsmoking history, body temperature of >37.3°C at the time of admission, \nrespiratory failure and age ≥60 years.12 Among these, the OR for \nsmoking history was highest at 14 (CI [1.6–45]; p=0.018), which was \nhigher than the ORs for other factors associated with disease \ndeterioration (8.5–9.0). As noted earlier, COVID-19 is considered to be \nsevere and associated with a higher mortality rate in elderly patients \nwith underlying diseases; it is worth noting that underlying diseases \nrelated to the severity of COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are all strongly \nassociated with smoking.13,14\nCOVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory tract, and virus \nentry into cells, viral replication and virion release occur within the \nrespiratory tract.15 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 converts the \nvasoconstrictor angiotensin II to vasoprotective angiotensin.1–7 Multiple \nstudies have shown that ACE-2 is a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2.16 \nSARS-CoV-2 enters cells through ACE-2 receptors present in mucosal \nepithelial cells and alveolar tissues in a clathrin-dependent process. \nCigarette smoking increases the expression of ACE-2 in pulmonary \ntissues, which could in part account for the increased risk of \ninfection.17,18 Additionally, the WHO has noted that smokers perform \nrepeated hand to face reciprocal movements, which contribute to \nincreased opportunity for virus entry.19\nACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers also increase the \nexpression of ACE-2 receptors, which could increase the risk of \nCOVID-19 infection. In fact, the ECDC reported that 74% of COVID-19 \nfatalities in Italy had concomitant hypertension, suggesting an \nassociation with these drugs.10 Many societies, including the European \nSociety of Cardiology, have issued alerts that patients with \ncardiovascular diseases discontinue ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-\nreceptor blockers.20 Switching to calcium antagonists has been \nsuggested; however, further evidence for this is needed.21\nAlthough only a few reports on smoking have been published to date \nand further accrual of evidence is warranted, smoking is likely to be an \nimportant and significant factor associated with COVID-19 severity. \nCigarette smoking decreases lung function, and evidently poses a \ngeneral risk factor for severe respiratory infections, thus there is an \napparent association between cigarette smoking and COVID-19 \nseverity. The detailed mechanism by which COVID-19 becomes more \nsevere in patients with a history of cigarette smoking warrants further \ninvestigation. There is also a need for more evidence on the effect of \nsecond-hand smoke on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, according \nto published COVID-19 research reports, even at this stage, it might be \nwell assumed that smokers are likely to be at serious risk for contracting \nSARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary \nclearance and immune function as early as 1 month. Thus, smoking \ncessation awareness is strongly encouraged as part of public health \nmeasures to limit the global impact of COVID-19. \n1.\t\nWHO. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.

  "ERJ-01340-2020.pdf": "Current smoking is not associated with\nCOVID-19\nTo the Editor:\nWe have read with interest the paper by LEUNG et al. [1] recently published in the European Respiratory\nJournal, reporting a higher expression of the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) in the\nsmall airway epithelia of smokers and COPD patients with putatively important implications for\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, since ACE-2 has been shown to be the receptor utilised by\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter the host cell [2]. Furthermore, the\nauthors reported that current smokers showed a higher expression of ACE-2 gene expression than\nnon-smokers, concluding that the increased ACE-2 expression in smokers might predispose to increased\nrisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [1].\nTo this regard, all epidemiological data published so far reported that COVID-19 patients show a very low\nprevalence of smokers, with no significant association between current smoking and severe disease in\nCOVID-19 patients [3–6].\nAt the University-Hospital of Padova, located in the Veneto Region, one of the areas in Italy most affected\nby COVID-19, between 15 March and 10 April, 2020, 132 patients were assessed in our clinic for\nSARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia. The analysis of patients’ smoking history showed that no-one was a\ncurrent smoker, with 112 patients (84.8%) who had never smoked and 20 (15.2%) who were former\nsmokers. These data are in agreement with those from China [3–6]. Furthermore, there was no difference\nin the disease severity between patients who never smoked and former smokers. These data are even more\nstriking if we consider that the percentage of current smokers in Italy and in the Veneto Region is 25.7%\nand 22.7%, respectively (www.epicentro.iss.it/passi/dati/fumo).\nThus, the conclusions of LEUNG et al. [1] to consider cigarette smoking as a severe risk factor for\nCOVID-19 pneumonia are in contrast with the strong and consolidated epidemiological data coming from\nChina [3–6] that have been confirmed also in our patients.\nMarco Rossato\n, Lucia Russo, Sara Mazzocut, Angelo Di Vincenzo, Paola Fioretto and Roberto Vettor\nClinica Medica 3, Dept of Medicine – DIMED, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.\nCorrespondence: Marco Rossato, Clinica Medica 3, Dept of Medicine – DIMED, University-Hospital of Padova, Via\nGiustiniani, 2, 35128 Padova, Italy.

Rossato and co-workers, we too have been struck by the relative underrepresentation of current\nsmokers in cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, particularly in light of our recent\nfindings\nthat\nthe\nsevere\nacute\nrespiratory\nsyndrome\ncoronavirus\n2\n(SARS-CoV-2)\nreceptor\nangiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) is upregulated in the airway epithelium of this population [1].\nChina [2], Italy (as reported by M. Rossato and co-workers), and now New York City [3] have all reported\ncurrent smoking rates below those of their respective general populations. The reason for this is a mystery.\nOne possible explanation is misclassification of smoking status owing to under-reporting of smoking in these\ncohorts. Another is that smokers may be taking medications that may offer some protection against\nCOVID-19 (e.g. certain inhalers). It should be noted that severe COVID-19 preferentially targets the older\npopulation (>65 years) with comorbidities, in whom smoking rates are approximately 3–5 fold lower than that\nin the general population. Thus, the background smoking rates in the severe COVID-19 susceptible subgroups\nmay be much lower than the general smoking rates of the population. Notwithstanding these issues, we\nshould be extraordinarily cautious about the messaging surrounding smoking and COVID-19, especially in\nthese fraught times where misinformation is commonly amplified in a vacuum of rigorous evidence [4, 5]. We\nare unaware of any evidence to date that demonstrates that smoking is protective against COVID-19. In fact,\nalthough current smoking has not been found to be a major risk factor for COVID-19, COPD patients appear\nto have worse outcomes upon contracting the virus with an almost threefold odds ratio of dying, needing\nmechanical ventilation, or being admitted to an intensive care unit [6]. As many of our COPD patients in this\npandemic fit an unfavourable demographic profile – elderly, male, and with cardiovascular comorbidities – we\nwould continue to recommend exercising caution in protecting them from COVID-19.\nJanice M.

This information may influence smoking \ncessation related beliefs in smokers.\nMETHODS Online questionnaires were answered from 26 March to 3 April 2020 \nin the Netherlands by 340 smokers willing to quit smoking. Beliefs regarding \n(quitting) smoking and (consequences of) the coronavirus are described and \nassociations with motivation to quit due to the coronavirus are reported.\nRESULTS While 67.7% of the smokers indicated that the coronavirus did not \ninfluence the number of cigarettes smoked per day, 18.5% smoked less cigarettes \nand 13.8% smoked more cigarettes per day due to the coronavirus. One-third \nof the smokers were more motivated to quit smoking due to the coronavirus. \nMotivation to quit due to the coronavirus was positively associated with beliefs \nabout the coronavirus as a serious threat, being at high risk of catching the \ncoronavirus and developing severe illness, smokers being at higher risk than \nnon-smokers, quitting smoking to reduce complaints, the social environment \nendorsing quitting, and perceived stress.\nCONCLUSIONS Subgroups of smokers may be receptive to smoking cessation advice \ndue to COVID-19. Because of the measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus \n(e.g. stay at home as much as possible), personalized digital health interventions \nmay be particularly suitable to reach smokers at home.\nINTRODUCTION \nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory \ninfection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as \ncoronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic has determined \ndaily life in most countries in the past weeks/months \nand there is no end in sight.\nThe current situation may influence (beliefs \nabout) smoking behavior. Smokers may smoke \nmore tobacco because of higher stress levels due to \nthe crisis situation1. Yet, smokers may also perceive \nincreased susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19, \npotentially increasing motivation to quit.\nThe coronavirus may pose an additional threat to \nsmokers. First, the hand-to-mouth movement while \nsmoking can facilitate viral infection. Public health \nmeasures strongly advise to avoid touching eyes, \nnose and mouth, since hands can transfer the virus \nto the face and from there enter the body. Second, \ntobacco smoke damages the lungs of the smoker and \ncompromises the immune system resulting in an \nincreased risk for respiratory infections and negative \ndisease progressions2. \nThere is distinct evidence that smoking status is \nassociated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. \nA recent meta-analysis revealed that current smoking \nincreases the risk of severe COVID-19 by around \ntwofold (pooled OR=1.98; 95% CI: 1.29–3.05)3. \nMehra et al.4 evaluated the relationship of smoking \nstatus and in-hospital mortality among 8910 \nAFFILIATION\n1 Department of Health Promotion, \nMaastricht University/CAPHRI, \nMaastricht, The Netherlands\n2 Centre for Health Protection, \nNational Institute for Public Health \nand the Environment (RIVM), \nBilthoven, The Netherlands\nCORRESPONDENCE TO\nJan M.

Current smoking \nstatus was found to be independently associated with \nan increased risk of death (OR=1.79; 95% CI: 1.29–\n2.47). \nSmokers may be influenced by (news) reports \non these findings about the link between smoking \nand COVID-19. Therefore, this study describes \nDutch smokers’ perceptions regarding susceptibility \nto and severity of COVID-19 and its effect on \nsmoking behavior (i.e. number of cigarettes \nsmoked) and difficulty to quit smoking. Associations \nbetween beliefs and motivation to quit due to the \n(consequences of) coronavirus are reported. As \nthere may be gender differences in psychological \nresponses to crises, differences in beliefs between \nmen and women are also described5.\nMETHODS\nFrom 26 March to 3 April 2020, a questionnaire \nwas distributed to smokers willing to quit smoking. \nInclusion criteria were that participants were aged \n≥18 years, have smoked cigarettes in the past 7 \ndays, and were motivated to quit smoking within \n5 years. The sample was provided by Flycatcher, a \nDutch ISO certified internet research agency with \nmore than 10000 voluntary members. In return for \nfull participation, panel members received a lottery \nticket and points, which can be redeemed for gift \nvouchers. Informed consent was obtained online. \nThe questionnaire was part of an overarching project \non digital smoking cessation interventions for which \nethical approval was granted by the institutional \nethical review committee (FHML-REC/2019/072). \nPotential participants were selected for invitation \nbased on the inclusion criteria. Flycatcher sent an \ninvitation e-mail to 463 members of their panel, of \nwhich N=340 completed the questionnaire (response \nrate: 73%). \n The I-Change model6, aimed at explaining \nmotivational and behavioral change by integrating \nvarious social-cognitive theories, served as a \ntheoretical framework for the beliefs about smoking \nand the coronavirus and covered risk perception, \nattitude, social norms, self-efficacy, and action \nplanning (Figure 1). All items were measured on \na 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=‘Strongly \ndisagree’ to 5=‘Strongly agree’. Means and 99.99% \nconfidence intervals for the beliefs were calculated \nand are reported as diamonds in the left-hand panel \nof Figure 1.\nCorrelations between the individual items and \nmotivation to quit (MTQ) due to (consequences of) \nthe coronavirus were calculated. MTQ due to the \ncoronavirus (i.e. ‘Because of the coronavirus, I'm \nnow more motivated to quit smoking’) was measured \non a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=‘Strongly \ndisagree’ to 5=‘Strongly agree’. The association \nstrength is reported in the right-hand panel of Figure \n1. The diamonds visualize the correlation coefficients \nwith 95% confidence intervals. \nThe confidence interval-based estimation \nof relevance (CIBER) approach was employed \nto visualize the results7. The tool is part of the \n‘userfriendlyscience’8 package for the statistical \ncomputing environment R. \nFurthermore, changes in smoking behavior due \nto the coronavirus (i.e. ‘Because of the coronavirus, \nI now smoke more/less a day’) were measured \nwith response options being 1=‘Less cigarettes’, \n2=‘Unchanged’, and 3=‘More cigarettes’. For \nresponse options 1 and 3, the exact number of \ncigarettes smoked less or more was measured as well.\nDemographics were assessed by age, gender, and \neducation level (low, intermediate, high). Cigarette \ndependence was assessed by the Fagerström Test9. \nThe six items of the scale were summed into an \noverall score ranging from 0 to 10. Willingness to \nquit smoking was assessed by asking participants \nwhen are they planning to quit smoking (within \n1 month, within 6 months, within 1 year, within 5 \nyears).\nRESULTS\nSample characteristics\nThe mean age of participants was 49 years (SD=13; \nrange=21–80) and the majority was female (60.9%). \nOf the participants, 21.8% had a low level of \ncompleted education (i.e. no education or primary \neducation), 42.6% an intermediate level (i.e. \nsecondary education), and 35.6% a high level (i.e. \ntertiary education). The mean cigarette dependence \nwas moderate (M=3.8; SD=2.5). Participants smoked \nan average of 88.8 (SD=67.9) cigarettes in the past \n7 days. Sixty-three participants (18.5%) were willing \nto quit within 1 month, 124 (36.5%) were willing to \nquit within 6 months, 91 (26.8%) were willing to quit \nTobacco Prevention & Cessation\nShort Report\n3\nTob.

Of our sample, 18.5% indicated that \nthey smoke less cigarettes due to the coronavirus \n(M=4.1 cigarettes/day, SD=3.3), 13.8% indicated \nthat they smoke more cigarettes (M=7.3 cigarettes/\nday, SD=8.2), and 67.7% did not alter the number \nof cigarettes. \nThe CIBER analyses (Figure 1) reveal that MTQ \ndue to the coronavirus was positively associated with \nbeliefs about the coronavirus as a serious threat, \nbeing at high risk of catching the coronavirus and \ndeveloping severe illness, smokers being at higher \nrisk than non-smokers, quitting smoking to reduce \ncomplaints, the social environment endorsing \nquitting, and perceived stress. All beliefs reported \nin Figure 1, except for self-efficacy (‘Because of the \ncoronavirus, I find it hard to quit smoking’), were \nsignificantly (p<0.01) positively associated with \nMTQ due to the coronavirus. These items together \nexplained 66–77% of the variance in MTQ due to \ncoronavirus. \nAnalysis of variance also confirmed that smokers \nmotivated to quit were significantly (p<0.01) more \nconvinced of all these items than smokers not \nmotivated to quit.\nDifferences in beliefs about smoking and the \ncoronavirus between men and women\nMen and women differed statistically significantly \non two items. Women compared to men indicated \nthat they experience more stress in their daily life \nbecause of the coronavirus [F(1,338)=11.94; p<0.001; \nηp\n2=0.034; 95% CI: 0.006–0.080] and that they found \nit more difficult to quit smoking because of the \ncoronavirus [F(1,338)=11.47; p<0.001; ηp\n2=0.033; \n95% CI: 0.006–0.078].\nDISCUSSION\nOne-third of our smokers were more motivated to \nquit smoking due to the coronavirus. Our results \nreveal which beliefs may be especially important \nto incorporate in smoking cessation interventions \nin times of COVID-19, such as the risks of being a \nsmoker, and support from their social environment. \nSince people are advised to stay at home in many \ncountries to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, \ndigital health smoking cessation interventions form \nan effective way to reach smokers10. In order to \nreach as many smokers as possible and reduce the \nspread of the coronavirus, we advocate evidence-\nbased (digital health) interventions that are easily \naccessible for all citizens and include the latest \nevidence about the relation between smoking and \nCOVID-19.\nLimitations\nA limitation of this study is that we included all \nsmokers willing to quit smoking within 5 years. Thus, \nthe sample consists of smokers highly motivated to \nquit and smokers less motivated to quit. Inclusion \ncriteria of only smokers who are contemplating or \npreparing to quit may lead to different results.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of the present study provide evidence that \nperceiving the coronavirus as a serious threat and \nacknowledging that smokers are at higher risk than \nnon-smokers is associated with motivation to quit. \nBelieving that quitting decreases that risk and that \nfriends and family endorse quitting is also associated \nwith motivation to quit.\nREFERENCES\n1.\t Kassel JD, Stroud LR, Paronis CA.

COVID-19\nwas going to be added to the long list of diseases caused by smoking and\nwas becoming the latest key argument to recommend avoiding tobacco\nuse and quitting smoking [1,3,4]. However, Lippi and Henry [5] pub-\nlished in the European Journal of Internal Medicine a meta-analysis\nwith an unequivocal title: “Active smoking is not associated with se-\nverity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)”. In this meta-analysis,\nbased on ﬁve Chinese studies, the authors reported a pooled odds ratio\n(OR) for COVID-19 progression of 1.69 (95% conﬁdence interval, CI,\n0.41-6.92) for smokers versus non-smokers. This study enjoyed wide-\nspread visibility in the scientiﬁc literature, as well as the lay press and\nvarious online social networks. It has been cited, posted or tweeted,\nparticularly by researchers or subjects ﬁnancially supported by the to-\nbacco industry.\nOn 30 April 2020, Guo [6] published a commentary on Tobacco\nInduced Diseases, showing that the meta-analysis by Lippi and Henry\n[5] contained several mistakes in data collection. Guo did a meta-\nanalysis using correct ﬁgures from the same ﬁve studies and obtained\nan OR of 2.20 (95% CI, 1.31-3.67).\nWe double-checked the two meta-analyses and agree with all the\ncriticism raised by Guo [6]. We feel justiﬁed in drawing attention to a\nnumber of mistakes and debatable choices made by Lippi and Henry in\ntheir review [5], which were only partially addressed by Guo [6]. With\nreference to the study by Guan and colleagues [7], Lippi and Henry's\nmeta-analysis considered the OR for severity at admission, but, as\nshown in Table 1, they misreported that they had considered the OR for\na composite outcome, i.e. requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission\nor mechanical ventilation, or death (mistake 1). The decision to con-\nsider the OR for severity at admission (OR: 1.51; 95% CI 0.97-2.36)\ninstead of for the composite outcome (OR: 2.60; 95% CI 1.45-4.66) is\nhighly debatable (debatable choice 1), since the composite outcome,\nnot surprisingly deﬁned as the primary endpoint by Guan and collea-\ngues [7], seems a more reliable and objective measure of the progres-\nsion of the disease.\nThen too, Lippi and Henry [5] considered the OR for current smo-\nkers versus non-smokers (former and never smokers combined; deba-\ntable choice 2). However - at least when the information is available - it\nis preferable to compare the risk of ever (current and former smokers)\nversus never smokers (from information provided by Guan et al. [7] one\ncan estimate an OR of 1.87; 95% CI 1.25-2.82) or current versus never\nsmokers (OR: 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.49). In fact, given that a large\nproportion of ex-smokers quit smoking because of smoking-related\nconditions [8], the inclusion of ex-smokers in the reference category\nwould bias any possible eﬀect of current smokers.\nFor the same reason, the inclusion in the meta-analysis of the study\nby Huang and colleagues [9], providing estimates for current versus\nnon-smokers, is debatable too (debatable choice 3). For this study the\ncorrect number of non-severe patients is 28 (not 31; mistake 2) and the\ncorresponding OR is 0.27 (95% CI, 0.01-5.62), not 0.30 (95% CI, 0.01-\n6.26; mistake 3) [9]. The choice of univariate estimate for Liu and\ncolleagues’ study [10] (OR: 12.19; 95% CI, 1.76-84.31) instead of\nmultivariate estimate (OR: 14.29; 95% CI, 1.58-25.00) is also debatable\n(debatable choice 4). It is not by chance, in fact, that the multivariate\nresult was reported by Liu and colleagues in the Abstract [10]. The\nstudy by Yang and colleagues [11] gives the number of non-severe\npatients (i.e. survivors) as 20, not 18 (mistake 4). More importantly, the\ncorrect OR - also reported by Guo [6] - is 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01-2.50) not\n3.03 (95% CI, 0.14-68.71; mistake 5). Finally, in the study by Zhang\nand colleagues [12], the number of severe patients is 58 not 60 (mistake\n6). Thus, the corresponding OR is 7.30 (95% CI, 0.34-154.96) not 7.05\n(95% CI, 0.33-149.60; mistake 7).\nThe worrying number of mistakes and debatable choices in the Lippi\nand Henry paper [5] is not the only problem. The main concern is their\nuse of a non-standard method to compute meta-analytic ﬁgures\n[13,14]. As well explained also in a rebuttal letter by Lo and Lasnier\n[14], the model Lippi and Henry used [5] has fundamental ﬂaws which\nresult in incorrect uncertainty intervals. We re-analyzed the same (in-\ncorrect) ORs used in their meta-analysis [5] but with standard proce-\ndures in R (metagen package) and found the same ﬁxed-eﬀects point\nestimate for the OR. However, we found a slimmer 95% CI, giving a\nsigniﬁcant ﬁgure (OR: 1.69; 95% CI, 1.11-2.58).

Accord-\ningly, Carmona-Bayonas [15] used a Bayesian random-eﬀects model to\nﬁnd a 95% posterior probability of the disease following a worse course\nin a smoker compared to a non-smoker.\nMoreover, the comments of other researchers on the Lippi and\nHenry meta-analysis [5], including the warning to be cautious, taking\npublished data as only preliminary [16] and recommending a correct\ninterpretation of pooled estimates from studies with potential limita-\ntions [17], are common sense. However, in this case they are super-\nﬂuous since they rely on properly conducted meta-analyses.\nLippi and colleagues replied to the comments by Garuﬁand col-\nleagues [16], with a letter to the editor entitled “Active smoking and\nCOVID-19: a double-edged sword” [18]. The letter reported the results\nfrom two additional studies [19,20], apparently in favor of the hy-\npothesis that there was no relation between smoking and COVID-19\nprogression. However, Lippi and colleagues overlooked some other\nﬁndings from the same studies which contrast with their hypothesis.\nFor instance, from the article by Petrilli et al. [19], Lippi and colleagues\nreported the crude OR for current versus non-smokers as 0.63 (95% CI,\n0.40-1.00), without mentioning that the study found inconclusive re-\nsults for ever smokers, with a multivariate OR of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.65-\n1.21) [19]. In addition, Lippi et al. [18] reported that in the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Response Team study\n[20] the proportion of current smokers among ICU patients was nearly\nhalf that among non-ICU patients, the crude OR of ICU for current\nversus non smokers being 0.51 (95% CI, 0.19-1.36). But again they did\nnot mention that former smokers were 7.2% of ICU patients and 4.4%\nof non-ICU patients, corresponding to a crude OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.07-\n2.70). More importantly, when considering all the participants in that\nstudy (not only hospitalized, but also non-hospitalized patients, who\nwere excluded in Lippi and colleagues’ estimates [18]), the OR for ever\nversus never smokers from the CDC COVID-19 Response Team study\n[20] was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.82-3.73) [13].\nThe latest systematic review, published in pre-print on 23 May\n2020, clariﬁed the role of smoking in COVID-19 severity and mortality,\nsummarizing the main ﬁndings so far [21]. It examined 22 studies re-\nporting disease severity in hospitalized patients according to smoking\nstatus. The meta-analysis included only three fair-quality studies. Cur-\nrent smokers were at higher risk of more severe disease than never\nsmokers (RR: 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.75). There was no signiﬁcant dif-\nference between former and never smokers (RR: 1.51; 95% CI, 0.82-\n2.80).\nAnother recent meta-analysis included 19 studies for a total of\n11,590 COVID-19 patients [13]. Of these, 30% of ever smokers ex-\nperienced disease progression, compared with 18% of non-smokers\n(OR: 1.91, 95% CI, 1.42-2.59). Results were similar for current versus\nnever smokers (OR: 1.91; 95% CI, 1.10-3.29), but based on only ﬁve\nstudies [13].\nIn conclusion, the meta-analysis by Lippi and Henry [5] suﬀers from\na surprising number of errors, resulting in misleading conclusions. It is\nthe only review so far indicating no relation between smoking and\nCOVID-19 severity. There are now at least 17 further studies in sub-\nsequent meta-analyses [13,21] that provide deﬁnite evidence of a direct\nrelationship between tobacco smoking and COVID-19 severity and\nprogression.\nGiven the self-declared lack of competing interest of these authors,\nwe are conﬁdent that the paper is the result of an unfortunate series of\nhonest errors, with no intentional misconduct. The authors, not experts\nin tobacco control, were probably not aware of the serious, far-reaching\npotential consequences of their erroneous results, statements and con-\nclusions. In fact, they were – and are still - giving the tobacco industry\nand its advocates a chance to raise doubts about the evidence that\nsmoking worsens COVID-19 progression and prognosis. Unfortunately,\nthis has substantially reduced the eﬃcacy of the tobacco control com-\nmunity's claims to support smoking cessation in the COVID-19 era.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNone to declare.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Paolo D'Argenio, TobaccoEndgame, Italy (https://\ntobaccoendgame.it/),\nProf.\nMaria\nSoﬁa\nCattaruzza,\nLa\nSapienza\nUniversity, Rome, Italy, and Dr. Vincenzo Zagà, President of the Italian\nSociety for Tobaccology (SITAB; https://www.tabaccologia.it/) for\ntheir suggestions and comments.

  "ADD-116-982.pdf": "Assessing and addressing collider bias in addiction\nresearch: the curious case of smoking and COVID-19\nAddiction researchers need to be more aware of collider bias\nas a possible explanation for ﬁndings. This could be an\nexplanation for an apparently protective effect of smoking on\nCOVID-19.\nAddiction researchers tend to have a keen eye for con-\nfounder bias. They are often quick to spot why variables\nthat cause both an exposure and an outcome can produce\nspurious associations. A researcher who is studying possi-\nble gateway effects (for example, the likelihood of cocaine\nuse among people who have prior exposure of cannabis\nuse) will take care to control for confounding variables,\nsuch as the personality trait ‘novelty-seeking’. In this sim-\nulated example, novelty-seeking is a cause of cannabis\nuse and also a cause of cocaine use [1]. Unless controlled\nfor, confounders may suggest a causal association between\ncannabis and cocaine use where none exists. However,\nthere is another source of bias that is often neglected:\ncollider bias. Collider bias can be seen as the ﬂip side of con-\nfounder bias, but it is much less intuitive. Whereas con-\nfounders cause both exposures and outcomes, colliders\nare caused by both exposures and outcomes (Fig. 1 shows\ndirected acyclic graphs). Whereas controlling for a con-\nfounder removes bias, controlling for a collider can produce\nit. So, when do confounder and collider bias occur?\nConfounder bias occurs when an analysis fails to ade-\nquatelycontrol for avariable, a ‘confounder’, that is a cause\nof both the exposure and outcome. The effect of this is to\ndistort the association between exposure and outcome. In\nthe above example, novelty-seeking (confounder) causes\nboth cannabis (exposure) and cocaine use (outcome). This\nindicates that people who use cannabis have higher levels\nof the novelty-seeking trait than those who do not. As high\nnovelty-seeking also causes people to use cocaine, there\nwill be a positive association between use of both drugs\neven if cannabis use does not itself cause subsequent co-\ncaine use. To determine whether or not cannabis use\ncauses cocaine use, the researcher must control for\nnovelty-seeking by adding it as a covariable in the analysis.\nThis will show whether people who use cannabis are more\nlikely to subsequently use cocaine than those who do not,\neven when they have the same level of novelty-seeking.\nBy controlling for the confounder, bias has been removed.\nBy contrast, collider bias occurs when an analysis con-\ntrols for, stratiﬁes on, or selects its sample based on a vari-\nable, a ‘collider’, that is caused by the exposure and also\ncaused by the outcome [2,3]. This distorts the association\nbetween the exposure and outcome. For example, a\nresearcher is interested in testing whether depression\n(the exposure) is associated with impulsivity (the out-\ncome). Let us assume that, in this simulated example, there\nis no association between depression and impulsivity in the\ngeneral population. However, depression and impulsivity\nboth increase the likelihood of a person using opioids—so\nopioid use is a collider. Controlling for opioid use in the\nanalysis would introduce a negative association between\ndepressive symptoms and impulsivity. It would make it ap-\npear that depression causes people to become less impul-\nsive, or impulsivity causes people to become less depressed.\nCollider bias occurs not only when adding a collider as a\ncovariable, but also when you select (or stratify) your sam-\nple based on a collider. This is also often called ‘selection\nbias’. This selection process happens frequently in addic-\ntion research. Using our previous example, selecting a sam-\nple of only people who use opioids would produce a\nnegative association between depressive symptoms and im-\npulsivity, where none existed in the general population\n(see Fig. 2). Another way to think about this is the follow-\ning: if you know someone uses opioids, but they have no\ndepressive symptoms, something must have caused them\nto start. Therefore, they may be more likely to be impulsive.\nConversely, people who are depressed may use opioids even\nif they are not very impulsive. Hence, the relationship\nshown in Fig. 2.\nRecently, it has been suggested that collider bias could\nbe a particular problem in research investigating whether\nsmoking may protect against contracting COVID-19 [4].\nIn many countries, people who develop a cough are ad-\nvised to be tested for COVID-19. However, both smoking\nand COVID-19 can cause coughing. Smokers who develop\na smoking-related cough may seek out a test even when\nthey do not have COVID-19. This would lead smokers to\nbe over-represented among those who test negative for\nCOVID-19, inducing a negative association between\nsmoking and COVID-19 where none really exists. This is\nbecause only those who are tested are included in the\nsample, and being tested is the result of the collider ‘having\na cough’. Thus, selecting for a sample of those who are\ntested for COVID-19 is the equivalent of conditioning on\nthis collider. Results from a recent systematic review sup-\nport the above interpretation: compared with people who\nhave never smoked, smokers were more likely to be tested\nfor COVID-19, but less likely to test positive [5]. It should\nbe noted that there is some evidence from sources that\nare unaffected by collider bias, such as seroprevalence\nstudies [6,7], that smokers have lower risk of contracting\n© 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction\nAddiction, 116, 982–984\nEDITORIAL\ndoi:10.1111/add.15348\nCOVID-19. Nonetheless, smokers may have worse out-\ncomes when hospitalized [5], so the overall effect of\nsmoking could be negative even if it protects against\ninfection.\nCollider bias has been implicated in seemingly protec-\ntive effects of smoking previously. For example, a recent\npaper explored the impact of collider bias in studies exam-\nining how smoking affects birth defects [8]. The authors\nfound that, in a sample where only live births were in-\ncluded, children of smokers were less likely to exhibit the\nbirth defect anencephaly relative to children of non-\nsmokers. Smoking (the exposure) and anencephaly (the\noutcome) both reduce the likelihood that pregnancy will\nend in a live birth (the collider). Therefore, only including\nlive births in a sample introduces collider bias, which in-\nﬂates the negative association between smoking and anen-\ncephaly. This could lead someone unaware of collider bias\nto erroneously conclude that smoking protects against an-\nencephaly. The authors also included results from pregnan-\ncies that did not result in live births. When they did so, the\nassociation weakened towards the null—which lends sup-\nport for the hypothesis that the association is due to collider\nbias rather than representing causality.\nWhat should addiction researchers do to address col-\nlider bias? First, we must think carefully about the causal\nrelationships between variables in our studies. This can\nbe done by drawing simple causal graphs, such as in\nFig. 1. Even if we do not present these graphs in our man-\nuscripts, having a better picture of the causal relationships\nbetween variables may help us to spot confounders and\ncolliders that we would have otherwise missed. Secondly,\nwe can design studies in a way that mitigates against the\nimpact of collider bias. These include using weighting of\nparticipants to make the sample more representative\nof the underlying population, with the aim of removing\nor minimizing the impact of biases in the selection of the\nsample. We can also use cross-contextual studies, where\nthe same associations are explored in different settings with\ndifferent underlying sample selection criteria. All these\nmethods have limitations, but crucially they have different\nlimitations. By triangulating different study designs, a\nclearer estimate of the likelihood of various causal associa-\ntions can be ascertained [9].\nThirdly, once a study has been conducted, we can look\nfor indicators of collider bias. We can examine the demo-\ngraphics of the sample being analysed to identify whether\nparticular groups are over- or under-represented. For ex-\nample, the over-representation of smokers among those\ntested for COVID-19, but their lower rates of testing positive\nrelative to never smokers, is indicative of collider bias. Sim-\nilarly, we can use ‘negative controls’: variables that we have\nreason to assume should not be associated. If an associa-\ntion is found with these, then the risk of collider bias may\nbe high [10].\nMuch as with confounding, it is often not possible to be\nsure that collider bias has been avoided or eliminated. How-\never, with a clearer understanding of what causes it, and\nchecks and balances to explore whether it could be present,\nwe can be better placed to interpret surprising and implau-\nsible ﬁndings with appropriate caution and caveat.\nFigure 2 Simulated example showing the association between depressive symptoms and impulsivity (a) in the general population and (b) among\npeople who use opioids. Opioid use is a collider, as it can be caused by depressive symptoms or impulsivity. Therefore, selecting a sample of opioid\nusers produces a spurious negative association between depressive symptoms and impulsivity.

A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis \nfound smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusu-\nally low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by \ncalculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association \nbetween smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering \nthe highly heterogeneous study populations.\nMethods:  The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from \nChina and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-\nadjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations.\nResults:  A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19–0.30). Unlike \nthe original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using ran-\ndom-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98–1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant \nassociation was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88–3.94).\nConclusion:  An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be gen-\neralized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires \nhospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other \nnicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented \nhypothesis.\n© The Author(s) 2021.

Therefore, it was not surprising that reports \nsuggested a higher risk for severe COVID-19 among hos-\npitalized smokers [2–4]. However, these studies failed to \nnotice the relatively low prevalence of smoking among \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  kfarsalinos@gmail.com\n1 Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, Department \nof Pharmacy, University of Patras, 26500 Rio‑Patras, Greece\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 9\nFarsalinos et al. Harm Reduct J            (2021) 18:9 \nhospitalized patients compared to population smoking \nrates [5, 6]. This was first noticed in Chinese case series, \nbut similar findings have been observed in other coun-\ntries, while it has also been reported that smoking may \nbe associated with lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection [7–10]. The possibility that smokers may be less \nlikely to develop severe COVID-19 that would require \nhospitalization is an important factor in determining the \noverall smoking-related risk. A higher risk for adverse \noutcome among hospitalized smokers is not applicable \nto all smokers if they are indeed less likely than non-\nsmokers to be hospitalized for COVID-19. In March, we \nhypothesized for the first time that nicotine may be pro-\ntective against COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory \nproperties and to a potential direct interaction between \nSARS-CoV-2 and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [11, \n12]. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway repre-\nsents a reflex mechanism that modulates the immune \nresponse and protects from hyper-inflammation, a hall \nmark of severe COVID-19 [13, 14]. Therefore, if the virus \ninteracts with the cholinergic system, dysregulation of \nthe cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway could result \nin an uncontrolled immune response. This hypothesis is \nnot contradictory to reports of a higher risk for adverse \noutcome in hospitalized smokers with COVID-19. Smok-\ners experience abrupt cessation of nicotine intake once \nhospitalized (unless nicotine replacement therapies \nare administered), resulting in the rapid elimination of \nplasma nicotine levels and deprivation of any hypotheti-\ncal beneficial effects.\nRecently, Karanasos et al. [15] published a systematic \nreview and meta-analysis of 22 studies, examining the \nimpact of smoking on disease severity and mortality of \nhospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. They \nalso performed a meta-regression analysis and stratified \nstudies according to the prevalence of diabetes among \npatients (< 15% and ≥ 15%). They reported that smok-\ning was associated with higher odds of disease severity \nin studies with low prevalence of diabetes. However, the \nauthors did not examine the smoking prevalence among \nhospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to the popula-\ntion smoking rates. Additionally, we noticed minor errors \nin the data presented (mentioned below) which were \naddressed in the present analysis. Finally, the authors \nused a fixed-effects method for the meta-analysis. This is \nrather odd and probably inappropriate, especially when \nit comes to the justification they proposed. The authors \nstated that they used fixed effects due to non-significant \nheterogeneity (I2 < 50%). This particular approach is ques-\ntionable since the I2 purpose is to quantify the degree \nof heterogeneity and not to test its significance. Indeed, \nthe respective statistical test based on the Cochran’s chi-\nsquare yielded a significant p value of 0.02. (Note that this \ntest has low power and thus a significant result is even \nmore important). That is, if the authors were to choose \nbased on purely statistical arguments, they should have \nchosen the random-effects model. Nevertheless, the \nchoice of fixed vs. random effects has been a matter of \ndebate in the literature and the prevailing approach is \nthat the model choice for meta-analysis should be based \non the sampling frame and not on the results of a statisti-\ncal test such as the test for heterogeneity in effect sizes \n[16, 17]. The studies analyzed included patients from dif-\nferent hospitals, geographical locations and countries, \nand age and comorbidities. Additionally, even the defi-\nnition of smoking was not universal in all studies, with \nsome reporting current and former smoking while others \nreporting “smoking history” or “smoking” [13]. Taking \ninto account that the primary goal of such an analysis is to \ngeneralize the results, one would argue that the random-\neffects model should have been the method of choice in \nthe first place, irrespective of the identified heterogene-\nity [16]. For these reasons, the random-effects model is \nconsidered more appropriate and is advocated by most \nexperts [16, 18, 19]. We also need to emphasize that in \ncase of zero heterogeneity the estimates of both models \ncoincide. Moreover, the choice of the fixed-effects model \ncomes to a direct disagreement with the subsequent \nuse of a random-effects meta-regression performed by \nthe authors [15]. Meta-regression is used to explore the \nsources of heterogeneity [20]; thus, its use contradicts the \ninitial argument for choosing the fixed-effects model.\nConsidering the above, and to address potential \nerrors in the original study, we re-analyzed the data and \nexpanded the analysis by: (1) calculating the prevalence \nodds ratio (POR) [21] of smoking among hospitalized \nCOVID-19 patients relative to population smoking rates \nand (2) examining the association between smoking and \nCOVID-19 severity and mortality, as well as the associa-\ntion between smoking and severity with studies stratified \naccording to diabetes prevalence (< 15% and ≥ 15%).\nMethods\nThe same studies as examined by Karanasos et al. were \nanalyzed herein (N = 22) [22–43]. Data extraction was \nperformed by two authors (K.F., P.B.). Smoking preva-\nlence was derived from the tables of each publication. \nSimilarly to Karanasos et  al., the studies were stratified \nby country in two groups: China and USA. The follow-\ning minor errors were noticed in the original analysis: \n(1) In the study by Shi et al. [34], 434 patients were non-\nsmokers (487 patients in total, of whom 40 were smokers, \n434 were non-smokers, and 13 had unknown smoking \nhistory). Karanasos et  al. presented 433 non-smokers \nin the original analysis. (2) In the study by Chen et  al. \n[40], 12 patients were current smokers and seven were \nPage 3 of 9\nFarsalinos et al. Harm Reduct J            (2021) 18:9 \n\t\nformer smokers. The original analysis by Karanasos et al. \nincluded former smokers as current smokers, but in all \nother studies former smokers were not included into the \ncurrent smokers group. 3. In the study by Wang et  al. \n[41], two groups of different patients were presented, \nboth of which had data on survival and smoking status \n(n = 296 and n = 44). Only the first group was included in \nthe original analysis, while we included all patients in the \ncurrent analysis.\nSmoking prevalence in each study was compared \nwith the expected prevalence based on gender and age-\nadjusted population smoking rates. The gender distribu-\ntion of patients (proportion of males and females) in each \nstudy was used for the gender adjustment. No gender \nadjustment was performed for one study because of una-\nvailable data [38]. Since no data were available on the age \ndistribution of patients, age adjustment was performed \nby assuming that all patients were aged ≥ 65 years. This \nage group has the lowest smoking rates in both China \nand the USA compared to other adult age groups, while \nthe mean or median age of patients in the studies was \nlower than 65 (Table 1). Thus, this age-adjustment under-\nestimates the expected smoking prevalence.

For \nmortality, five studies were analyzed. One study included \ndata on both disease severity and mortality, and it was \nused in both analyses [29]. The analysis of disease sever-\nity stratified by diabetes prevalence included ten studies \nwith prevalence < 15% [22–25, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37] and \nsix studies with prevalence ≥ 15% [26, 28, 30, 33, 38, 39].\nAll analyses were performed with inverse variance ran-\ndom-effects meta-analyses using Review Manager (Rev-\nMan) 5.4 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, \nThe Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).\nResults\nThe characteristics of the studies are presented in Table 1. \nThe number of expected smokers based on gender and \nage-adjusted population smoking rates is also reported. \nIn total, 7168 patients were analyzed, with 482 of them \nbeing smokers. The random-effects pooled prevalence \nof smoking was 7.0% (95%CI 5.1–9.3%). The expected \npooled prevalence of smoking was calculated at 24.1% \n(95%CI 20.1–28.3%). Only one study had more smokers \nthan the expected number of smokers [29].\nThe POR of smoking is presented in Fig. 1. The propor-\ntion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who reported \nbeing smokers was approximately 1/4th and 1/3rd the \nexpected proportion based on population smoking \nrates in China and USA, respectively, and 1/4th in the \ntotal sample. This indicates a substantial under-repre-\nsentation of smokers. The results of the random-effects \nmeta-analysis of the association between smoking and \ndisease severity and mortality are presented in Figs.  2 \nand 3, respectively. A statistically significant associa-\ntion was observed between smoking and disease sever-\nity in the Chinese studies (OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.09–2.26) \nbut not in the US studies (OR 0.66, 95%CI 0.33–1.32). \nNo statistically significant association between smoking \nand COVID-19 severity was found when all studies were \nanalyzed (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98–1.98). No statistically sig-\nnificant association was observed between smoking and \nCOVID-19 mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88–3.94), simi-\nlarly to the study by Karanasos et al. We also verified the \nstatistically significant association between smoking and \ndisease severity in the studies with low (< 15%) preva-\nlence of diabetes, which was not observed in the studies \nwith high diabetes prevalence (Fig. 4).\nDiscussion\nThis re-analysis of the recently published study by Kara-\nnasos et  al. identified a particularly low prevalence of \nsmoking among hospitalized COVID-19. This is con-\nsistent with previous publications [5, 6, 46]. It should \nbe emphasized that several limitations are applicable to \nthis analysis, mainly related to the  possibility for poor \nrecording or under-reporting of the smoking status, lack \nof adjustment for confounding factors and potential dif-\nferences in healthcare access between smokers and  non-\nsmokers. Another argument that has been suggested \nis that hospitalized COVID-19 cases are more likely to \nsuffer from smoking-related comorbidities and might \nhave already quit smoking because of these comorbidi-\nties. While this is a possibility, population surveys show \nthat comorbidities, such as COPD, are still more preva-\nlent in current rather than former smokers [47]. Some of \nthe studies included in this analysis reported “smoking” \nonly, without clarifying if former smokers where included \nin that group. Another type of selection bias could be \nlinked to smokers being more likely to be tested for res-\npiratory diseases than the general population. However, \nin a recent study of a large sample of COVID-19 patients \nin Mexico we noticed that smokers were less likely to be \ndiagnosed for COVID-19, but the proportion of patients \ntested for COVID-19 who were smokers was not different \nfrom the population prevalence of smoking [48]. In any \ncase, a vast difference between observed and expected, \npopulation-based, smoking prevalence was observed, \neven when the latter was adjusted by gender and age. The \nlack of high quality data or studies specifically evaluating \nthe effect of smoking on COVID-19 susceptibility and \nseverity is expected, considering the emergency of the \npandemic. However, priorities, recommendations and \ntreatment decisions should be based on best currently-\navailable evidence, and any gaps in knowledge should be \npresented so that efforts to be resolved will be intensified.\nOur analysis failed to reproduce the results of the study \nby Karanasos et al. concerning the association between \nsmoking and COVID-19 severity. We consider the use \nof random-effects meta-analysis crucial when examin-\ning studies with such diverse and heterogeneous popula-\ntions. However, other studies [2–4], including one by our \ngroup [46], found a positive association between smok-\ning and adverse outcome among hospitalized COVID-19 \npatients. Still, choosing a proper methodology in any data \nanalysis is important, irrespective of the study results \nor expectations. The low prevalence of smoking among \nhospitalized COVID-19 patients, combined with the \nincreased odds for severe disease when smokers are hos-\npitalized, which was not confirmed in this analysis but \nhas been reported in other studies, should be accurately \ninterpreted as a risk confined to a substantially smaller \nPage 5 of 9\nFarsalinos et al. Harm Reduct J            (2021) 18:9 \n\t\nthan the expected number of smokers who develop \nsevere COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. This is \ndifferent from interpreting the results as an indication \nof an elevated risk for all smokers. These findings are \nnot contradictory to a hypothesis we recently presented \nthat nicotine may have potential benefits, considering the \nrapid elimination of nicotine once smokers are admitted \nto the hospital and quit nicotine intake. In fact, clinicians \nshould consider administering pharmaceutical nicotine \nreplacement therapies in hospitalized smoking patients \nas “on-label” use, based on their indication as smoking \nsubstitutes [5]. Finally, while we verified the findings by \nKaranasos et al. concerning the studies with low preva-\nlence of diabetes, the authors suggested that smoking \nmay have a more pronounced adverse effect in younger, \nnon-diabetic patients. However, this interpretation is \nproblematic considering that their meta-regression is \nused to relate the results of the studies to published aver-\nages of patient characteristics within studies. This raises \nthe possibility for ecological fallacy [49], which can-\nnot be investigated due to the lack of individual patient \ndata. There is no information in any of the studies on \nwhether smokers were younger or had lower prevalence \nof diabetes compared to non-smokers. Thus, it is virtually \nimpossible to generate such a conclusion from the meta-\nregression analysis.\nUnderstandably, the issue of smoking is highly con-\ntroversial and the findings of this and other studies may \nFig. 1  Prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Moreover, there may \nbe concerns about the public perceiving smoking as a \nprotective factor, which could discourage smoking cessa-\ntion or might even encourage smoking relapse. However, \nit is the duty of the research community to focus on the \ndata only and present them in an unbiased and balanced \nway, by emphasizing the limitations but also by avoiding \npotential predispositions or result expectations. In that \nFig. 2  Random-effects meta-analysis of the association between smoking and COVID-19 severity.

Harm Reduct J            (2021) 18:9 \n\t\nrespect, the well-established evidence on the adverse \nhealth effects of smoking raises no doubt that smoking \ninitiation or continuation cannot be recommended as a \nprotective measure for COVID-19 (or any other disease). \nHowever, the consistent data on low smoking prevalence \namong hospitalized patients, despite their limitations, \nraise the possibility nicotine could have potential thera-\npeutic effects. Nicotine has been available for years in \npharmaceutical formulations and has been used thera-\npeutically even in non-smokers [50, 51]. It is also possible \nthat other pharmaceutical  agonists of nicotinic acetyl-\ncholine receptors may have similar therapeutic benefits \n[52], with animal studies showing effects similar to nic-\notine in promoting inflammatory control through the \nnicotinic cholinergic system [53–55]. Therefore, pharma-\nceutical nicotine replacement therapies or other nicotinic \nagonists should be investigated in experimental in vitro \nstudies and in clinical trials as a potential therapeutic \nmeasure for COVID-19.\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthors’ contributions\nKF conceived the study.

The objective was to assess whether smoking and e-ciga-\nrette use were associated with severe COVID-19.\nMethods: This cohort ran from 24 January 2020 until 30 April 2020 at the height of the\nﬁrst wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England. It comprised 7 869 534 people repre-\nsentative of the population of England with smoking status, demographic factors and\ndiseases recorded by general practitioners in the medical records, which were linked to\nhospital and death data. The outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization, inten-\nsive care unit (ICU) admission and death. The associations between smoking and the out-\ncomes were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models, with sequential adjustment\nfor confounding variables and indirect causal factors (body mass index and smoking-\nrelated disease).\nResults: Compared with never smokers, people currently smoking were at lower risk of\nCOVID-19 hospitalization, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.64 (95% conﬁdence inter-\nvals 0.60 to 0.69) for <10 cigarettes/day, 0.49 (0.41 to 0.59) for 10–19 cigarettes/day, and\n0.61 (0.49 to 0.74) for \u000220 cigarettes/day. For ICU admission, the corresponding HRs\nwere 0.31 (0.24 to 0.40), 0.15 (0.06 to 0.36), and 0.35 (0.17 to 0.74) and death were: 0.79\n(0.70 to 0.89), 0.66 (0.48 to 0.90), and 0.77 (0.54 to 1.09) respectively.

All-cause mortality was\nhigher for current smoking than never smoking, HR 1.42 (1.36 to 1.48). Among e-cigarette\nusers, the adjusted HR for e-cigarette use and hospitalization with COVID-19 was 1.06 (0.88\nto 1.28), for ICU admission was 1.04 (0.57 to 1.89, and for death was 1.12 (0.81 to 1.55).\nConclusions: Current smoking was associated with a reduced risk of severe COVID-19\nbut the association with e-cigarette use was unclear. All-cause mortality remained higher\ndespite this possible reduction in death from COVID-19 during an epidemic of SARS-\nCoV-2. Findings support investigating possible protective mechanisms of smoking for\nSARS-CoV-2 infection, including the ongoing trials of nicotine to treat COVID-19.\nKey words: Smoking, E-cigarettes, COVID-19, cohort study\nIntroduction\nEarly in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, smoking was identi-\nfied as a risk factor for worse outcomes from COVID-19—\na reasonable assumption given smoking is associated with\na higher incidence of most respiratory infections.1–3\nHowever, an ongoing systematic review, last updated on\n13 August 2021, reported evidence from 547 studies that\ncurrent smoking was associated with a reduced incidence\nof SARS-CoV-2.4 Current smoking was associated with\ngreater risk of severe disease, with a relative risk (RR) 1.3\n[[95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.01 to 1.71]. There was\ninconclusive evidence on whether the risks of hospitaliza-\ntion or death differed from those of people who have never\nsmoked, RR 1.10 (95%CrI 0.97 to 1.24) and RR 1.13\n(95%CrI 0.90 to 1.40), respectively. The same review\nfound evidence that people who previously smoked had a\nsimilar risk of infection as did people who have never\nsmoked but greater risk of severe COVID-19 if infected,\nwith risk estimates suggesting that people who had stopped\nsmoking were at greater risk than those who continued,\nbut these were not compared directly. However, many\nstudies of risk factors for severe COVID-19 have included\nonly cohorts of hospitalized patients. This can induce a\ntype of selection bias, collider bias, because several patient\nfactors influence the likelihood of hospitalization and\nthereby become correlated in hospitalized patients, irre-\ntrievably biasing the strength of associations.5,6 We there-\nfore need studies of largely unselected community dwelling\nparticipants with sufficient precision to determine the di-\nrection and strength of these associations.\nSmoking is a risk factor for many non-communicable\ndiseases, which are important risk factors for developing\nsevere COVID-19.7 However, it is important to determine\nwhether there is a direct causal relationship between smok-\ning and COVID-19 outcomes. Smoking is a risk factor for\ndisease following infection from many respiratory viruses\nand a natural assumption is that smoking is likely to\nworsen COVID-19. Key mechanisms that underlie this\ngeneral susceptibility include impaired mucocilary oscilla-\ntion and reduced cough reflex sensitivity leading to coloni-\nzation and reproduction of pathogens. Smoke impairs the\nepithelium by impairing the replenishment of cells and\nimpairing the integrity of intracellular contacts. Cell func-\ntion is impaired through accumulation of mutation reduc-\ning autophagy, further impairing the respiratory barrier.\nSmoke decreases the activity of nitric oxide synthetase, re-\nducing a key early defence against infection.8–10 Thus if\nsmoking were to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nor severe COVID-19, this would imply one or more con-\nstituents of tobacco smoke have specific effects against\nKey Messages\n• Compared with people who had never smoked, current smoking was associated with one-third lower risk of\nhospitalization, two-thirds lower risk of intensive care unit admission and one-ﬁfth lower risk of death.\n• People who had stopped smoking had a 10-20% higher risk of severe COVID-19.\n• There was uncertain evidence on the association between e-cigarette use and severe COVID-19 because of\nimprecision.\n• In this study, conducted at the height of English SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, current smoking was associated with higher\nall-cause mortality.\nInternational Journal of Epidemiology, 2022, Vol. 51, No. 4\n1063\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/4/1062/6531917 by guest on 01 April 2025\nSARS-CoV-2 infection, either on the virus itself or on the\nimmune defence structure of the lungs or more generally.9\nNicotine, which is widely available as a cheap pharmaceu-\ntical, is the plausible candidate component of smoke that\nmay have this effect and its possible role is described more\nin the Discussion.11 Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\nhas shown the importance of public trust in messaging,\nwhere the main weapon against the pandemic is changing\npopulation behaviour. Understanding and communicating\nwhether smoking is a protective or a risk factor for severe\nCOVID-19 should help maintain that trust. We therefore\nconducted a large community cohort study to examine the\nassociations between smoking, nicotine use and severe\nCOVID-19.\nMethods\nDesign and participants\nThis was an open cohort study from 24 January 2020 un-\ntil 30 April 2020 of all adults registered with 1205 gen-\neral practices in England contributing to the QResearch\ndatabase, representing 20% of English practices. The\nprotocol was published.12 Almost everyone is registered\nwith a general practitioner (GP), so this is a population\nsample. The GP database includes significant chronic\ndiseases and information on behavioural risk factors for\nillness. This was linked to SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcrip-\ntion polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test records\nheld by Public Health England (PHE), which includes all\npositive cases as it is a notifiable disease. The records\nwere linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), which\ngives information on the diagnoses of everyone admitted\nto hospitals in England and the Intensive Care National\nAudit\nand\nResearch\nCentre\n(ICNARC)\nCase\nMix\nProgramme database, providing data from all intensive\ncare units (ICUs) in England.13 They were also linked to\nall death certificates in England, which include date and\ncause of all deaths provided by the Office for National\nStatistics. Outcome data were available up to 30 April\n2020.\nWe identified a cohort of all patients aged 20 years and\nolder who were registered with the GP practices on the\nstart date (24 January 2020, the date of the first recorded\ninfection in the UK). Patients entered the cohort on this\ndate and were censored at the earliest of the following time\npoints: date of death from unrelated causes, leaving the GP\npractice, occurrence of the relevant outcomes of interest,\nor study end date (30 April 2020). We used all the relevant\npatients on the pooled database to maximize power and to\nenhance generalizability of the results.\nOutcomes\nThe outcomes were:\ni. hospital admission for COVID-19 deﬁned as having a\npositive test for SARS-CoV-2 and appearing in the\nHES dataset as an inpatient;\nii. admission to ICU with severe COVID-19 identiﬁed\nfrom ICNARC records;\niii. death from COVID-19 deﬁned ICD10-codes for con-\nﬁrmed (U07.1) or suspected COVID (U07.2) on death\ncertiﬁcates;\niv. all-cause mortality.\nThere was no population testing for SARS-CoV-2 tak-\ning place during this period in England, precluding analysis\nof the association between smoking, vaping and incidence\nof COVID-19 (see Supplementary material, available as\nSupplementary data at IJE online, for discussion of this).\nExposures\nGPs classified smoking status as never, former, light (1-9\ncigarettes/day), moderate (10-19 cigarettes/day) or heavy\nsmoking (\u000220 cigarettes/day). We used the most recent\nrecorded value of smoking status at study entry. We\ncounted a person as using nicotine replacement therapy\n(NRT) if they had been prescribed this within 28 days of\ncensoring. However, there were only 26 people with pre-\nscriptions of NRT in this period, meaning we could not es-\ntimate risks in this group, and they are not considered\nfurther. We classified a patient as using e-cigarettes if they\nhad a relevant clinical code recorded in their GP record at\nstudy entry.\nCovariates\nGPs in England have registers of patients and patients are\nnot permitted to see hospital specialists, except in emer-\ngency, without GP referral. GP records are computerized\nand GPs record all key diseases a person has, and we used\nthese recorded diagnoses in the analysis. Diseases are\nrecorded at the time of diagnosis, if diagnosed by a GP, or\nshortly after it (e.g. from discharge summaries from hospi-\ntal). We identified relevant potential confounding path-\nways using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We identified\nthat demographic factors (age, gender, socioeconomic sta-\ntus, ethnicity, region) and non-smoking-related disease\nwere potential confounders. The non-smoking-related dis-\neases were bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, ex-\ntrinsic allergic alveolitis/hypersensitivity, other interstitial\nlung diseases, hypertension, type 1 diabetes, chronic liver\ndisease,\nsuch\nas\nhepatitis,\nand\nchronic\nneurological\n1064\nInternational Journal of Epidemiology, 2022, Vol. 51, No. 4\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/4/1062/6531917 by guest on 01 April 2025\nconditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone dis-\nease, multiple sclerosis (MS), learning disability and cere-\nbral palsy. Two paths reflected part of the potential causal\neffect of smoking on the outcome: smoking-related disease\nand body mass index (BMI). The smoking-related diseases\nwere: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\nasthma, lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, coro-\nnary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation,\ntype 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\nIn the DAG, we identified confounding paths for the as-\nsociation\nbetween\nnicotine\nuse\n(vaping)\nand\nsevere\nCOVID-19 which were blocked by controlling for demo-\ngraphic factors (defined above) and smoking status.\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted multivariable Cox proportional hazards\nmodels to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ra-\ntios (HRs) for the association between smoking status and\nsevere COVID-19 using Stata version 16.0. We adjusted\nfirst for factors that blocked confounding associations (de-\nmographic factors and non-smoking-related diseases) and\nthen added factors on the indirect causal paths between\nsmoking and severe COVID-19. These were BMI (smoking\nreduces BMI) and smoking-related disease. This latter\nanalysis allowed us to estimate the direct causal path be-\ntween smoking and severe COVID-19 disease. In all analy-\nses, we entered all variables as categorical variables with\nunrecorded data as an additional categorical variable and\nage as a continuous variable.\nWe tested whether age, gender, ethnic group and the\npresence of asthma or COPD modified the association be-\ntween smoking and severe COVID-19. To do so, we added\nmultiplicative interaction terms to the regression models.\nWe confined the analysis of the association between\nvaping and severe COVID-19 to people who currently or\nhad previously smoked, as vaping is almost confined to\nthis group. We identified that confounding would be con-\ntrolled in these analyses by adjustment for demographic\nfactors and smoking status. We re-ran the analysis includ-\ning only people who were no longer smoking.\nGiven active smoking in the <10 cigarettes and 10-19\ncigarettes a day groups was associated with reduced mor-\ntality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, the question people\nwho smoke would face was whether to continue smoking\nthrough the pandemic or quit now. We examined all-cause\nmortality (including deaths due to COVID-19) using the\nfully adjusted model described above but combining all\ncurrent smoking categories.\nWe conducted four post-hoc sensitivity analyses de-\nscribed in the Supplementary material.\nResults\nThere were 8 256 161 adults in the cohort, of whom\n7 869 534 (95.3%) had recorded smoking status and were\nincluded in the analyses. Of these, 1 402 133 (17.8%)\nsmoked and 1 748 966 (22.2%) had previously smoked.\nThere were 69 047 (0.9%) recorded as using e-cigarettes,\nof whom 3251 (4.7%) were recorded as never smoking,\n35 267 (51.1%) as formerly smoking and 30 529 (44.2%)\nas currently smoking. In the cohort, 14 253 (0.18%) were\nadmitted to hospital with COVID-19, 1527 (0.019%)\nwere admitted to ICU and there were 5817 (0.074%)\ndeaths attributed to COVID-19. Baseline characteristics\nare shown in Table 1. Over half of those admitted to hospi-\ntal with COVID-19 were aged over 70 years and over half\nof those who died were aged over 80 years. In contrast,\nover half of those admitted to ICU with COVID-19 were\naged under 60 years.\nAssociation between smoking status and severe\nCOVID-19\nAfter\nadjustment\nfor\ndemographic\nfactors\nand\nnon-\nsmoking related morbidity, adults smoking fewer than 10\ncigarettes/day were one-third less likely to be hospitalized,\ntwo-thirds less likely to be admitted to ICU and one-fifth\nless likely to die from COVID-19 than people who had\nnever smoked (Table 2). After further adjustment for BMI\nand smoking-related morbidity these associations were\nlargely unchanged. The risk estimates for people smoking\n10-19 and more than 20 cigarettes/day were similar in\nmagnitude to the group smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes\ndaily, but estimates were less precise because 78% of peo-\nple who smoked reported smoking fewer than 10 ciga-\nrettes/day (Table 1).\nPeople who had stopped smoking had a 10-30% higher\nrisk of COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admission and\ndeath than people who had never smoked (Table 2).\nCompared with people who had stopped, people currently\nsmoking were 40-50% less likely to be admitted to hospital\nfor COVID-19, 70-80% less likely to be admitted to ICU\nand 30-40% less likely to have a COVID-19 related death.\nThere was evidence that the protective association be-\ntween smoking and severe COVID-19 was stronger in\nyounger people, men, ethnic minorities and people without\nairways disease (Supplementary material).\nAssociation between vaping and severe COVID-19\nThere were 69 472 people who used e-cigarettes, of whom\n65 796 (95%) had previously or currently smoked.

We confined the analysis to the\n35 267 people not currently smoking and the same pattern\nwas observed (Table 3).\nAll-cause mortality\nThere were 27 739 deaths in total, including 5817 from\nCOVID-19. In people currently smoking, the correspond-\ning figures were 3053 and 367, and in people who had\nstopped smoking were 10 381 and 2342. The HR for cur-\nrent smoking was 1.42 (1.36 to 1.48) and for previous\nsmoking was 1.11 (1.08 to 1.14) compared with never\nsmoking. There was heterogeneity by age (P <0.0001),\nhowever, with all age groups showing increased risk of\ndeath associated with smoking except for those over\n80 years, where the HR was 0.89 (0.83 to 0.95).\nPost-hoc sensitivity analyses\nSee the Supplementary material for full methods, results\nand discussion. Excluding people who lived in care homes\nfrom the analysis of death gave similar results. Analyses\nusing smoking status from 5 years previously showed that\ncurrent smoking was associated with a reduced risk of hos-\npitalization and ICU admission. However, current smoking\nfrom 5 years previously was associated with an increased\nrisk of death from COVID-19. Modelling age as a non-\nlinear term using restricted cubic splines produced results\nthat were very similar to those above. We stratified by\n(rather than adjusted for) the presence of smoking-related\ndisease and produced estimates for people with and with-\nout smoking-related disease, showing very similar out-\ncomes for each group as for both groups combined.\nDiscussion\nSummary\nIn this large community cohort, current smoking was asso-\nciated with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes\nand this was not explained by associated demographic or\nnon-smoking-related\nor\nsmoking-related\nmorbidity.\nCompared with people who had never smoked, the risk of\nhospitalization was reduced by one-third, the risk of ad-\nmission to ICU by two-thirds and the risk of death by one-\nfifth.

There was effect modifi-\ncation, with the risk reductions seen with current smoking\nbeing greater in men than women, in younger people than\nolder and in people without airways disease compared with\nthose with it. However, during the height of the English\nSARS-CoV-2 epidemic, all-cause mortality was higher in\npeople who smoked than in those who had stopped despite\nthe risk reduction in COVID-19 deaths observed.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe strengths of this study include the large representative\ncommunity cohort giving precise estimates of association\nwhich are likely to be generalizable to the whole UK popu-\nlation. In addition, smoking status was measured prior to\ndeveloping COVID-19 outcomes, unlike most studies in\nthe an ongoing systematic review4 which assessed smoking\nstatus on admission to hospital. People who are becoming\nbreathless with COVID-19 are likely to at least suspend\nsmoking and may declare that they have stopped smoking\non admission, thus giving rise to an apparent lower risk\nfrom smoking and higher risk from having stopped smok-\ning. That said, the prevalence of current smoking recorded\nin this study of medical records (17.8%) is higher than the\ncurrent\nEnglish\nsmoking\nprevalence\n(14.1%).14\nThis\nreflects that GPs recorded smoking status a median of 2\nyears prior to study end, when the prevalence was higher.\nThus, some people who were recorded as currently smok-\ning would subsequently have stopped smoking, and fewer\npeople recorded as having stopped are likely to have re-\nlapsed, resulting in a reclassification bias. This is likely to\nbias estimates towards the null.\nA key concern with observational epidemiological stud-\nies is that associations arise because of unmeasured or re-\nsidual confounding. Here, the E-value for the associations\nfor people smoking 1–9 cigarettes/day are 2.5 for hospitali-\nzation, 5.9 for ICU admission and 1.9 for death, with\nlower confidence interval E-values 2.3, 4.3 and 1.5, respec-\ntively..15,16 This means that an unmeasured confounder\nwould need to be 2.5 times as common among people who\nsmoked 1–9 cigarettes/day compared with never smokers,\nand to reduce risk of hospitalization 2.5-fold to explain the\nassociation between smoking and hospitalization. (A full\nrange of E-values are given in the Supplementary material,\ncompared with those calculated from a study of the harms\nof smoking. This showed E-values for well-established\nsmoking-related illnesses were of similar magnitude.)\nPeople who smoked were on average 11 years younger\nthan people who used to smoke and 2 years younger than\npeople who never smoked, and younger people are at sub-\nstantially less risk of severe COVID-19.

However, smoking protects against very few dis-\neases and the prevalence of these in the population makes\nresidual\nconfounding\nby\nsuch\nconditions\nunlikely.\nMoreover, an unmeasured confounder would need to be\ndistributed such that it increased the apparent risk in peo-\nple who have stopped smoking but decreased the apparent\nrisk in people who currently smoke. Differences by patients\nin their preferences or doctors in their referral behaviour\nfor hospital or ICU care could be related to smoking status,\nbut death as an outcome would not, so that the latter\nanalysis should be unbiased by selection factors.\nA weakness of these data is that e-cigarette use was\nprobably underestimated by GP records, with 0.8%\nrecorded as using e-cigarettes, when the national preva-\nlence is 5%.17 Although most users of e-cigarettes are\nlikely to be classified as not using them, they are greatly\noutnumbered by people who are genuinely not using e-cig-\narettes, and this is unlikely to distort the association mean-\ningfully. The more serious bias would arise if people\nrecorded as using e-cigarettes were no longer using them.\nVaping status was recorded a median of 23 (interquartile\nrange 38 to 10) months prior to study start. One cohort\nsuggested that over half of initial users have ceased e-\ncigarette use after 6 months.18 If e-cigarette use were pro-\ntective, then including former users in this group would di-\nlute the effect estimate.\nIn this study, we were unable to assess the association be-\ntween smoking and incidence of COVID-19 because popu-\nlation testing was not conducted during the study period.\nOne study suggested that only around 3% of older people\nwith COVID-19 symptoms were admitted to hospital.19\nThus, we are unable to assess whether smoking may protect\nagainst infection with SARS-CoV-2 or alter the course of\ndisease to reduce its severity in people with infection. That\nsaid, it is the incidence of severe COVID-19 that is putting\nenormous strain on hospitals in countries with active SARS-\nCoV-2 epidemics, not the incidence of much more common\nbut milder COVID-19. Arguably therefore, severe disease is\nthe most relevant outcome to assess. Hospital testing was\nuniversal during this period, which means that differences\nbetween people who smoke and those who do not in testing\nare unlikely to greatly affect our findings here. However,\naround one-fifth of deaths occurred in people who were\nnever admitted to hospital, often very frail with multimor-\nbidity and living in care homes. As such, the diagnosis of\ndeath from COVID-19 was clinical and not microbiological,\nbut misattribution of cause of death is unlikely to be differ-\nentially related to smoking status.\nWe found that the association between smoking and re-\nduced risk of severe COVID was greater in younger people.\nThis may reflect that older people had already developed\nTable 3 Association between e-cigarette use and severe COVID-19 outcomes among people who currently or previously\nsmoked\nPeople currently or previously smoking (n ¼ 3 151 099)\nPeople who had previously smoked (n ¼ 1 748 966)\nNumber with\noutcome (cumula-\ntive incidence\nexpressed as %)\nUnadjusted HR\n(95% CI)\nHR (95% CI) adjusted\nfor demographic\nfactors\nand smoking\nNumber\nwith\noutcome\nUnadjusted HR\n(95% CI)\nHR (95% CI)\nadjusted for\ndemographic\nfactors and smoking\nOutcome\nhospitalization\nNot using\ne-cigarettes\n6011 (0.19%)\n1 (reference)\n1 (reference)\n4934(0.29%)\n1 (reference)\n1 (reference)\nUsing e-cigarettes\n109 (0.17%)\n0.85 (0.70 to 1.03)\n1.06 (0.88 to 1.28)\n72(0.20%)\n0.71 (0.56 to 0.89) 1.02 (0.81 to 1.29)\nOutcome ICU\nadmission\nNot using\ne-cigarettes\n579 (0.02%)\n1 (reference)\n1 (reference)\n507(0.03%)\n1 (reference)\n1 (reference)\nUsing e-cigarettes\n11 (0.02%)\n0.89 (0.49 to 1.62)\n1.04 (0.57 to 1.89)\n11(0.03%)\n1.05 (0.58 to 1.91) 1.20 (0.66 to 2.20)\nOutcome death\nNot using\ne-cigarettes\n2671 (0.09%)\n1 (reference)\n1 (reference)\n2318(0.14%)\n1 (reference)\n1 (reference)\nUsing e-cigarettes\n38 (0.06%)\n0.67 (0.48 to 0.92)\n1.12 (0.81 to 1.55)\n24(0.07%)\n0.50 (0.34 to 0.75) 1.03 (0.69 to 1.54)\nICU, intensive care unit.\nInternational Journal of Epidemiology, 2022, Vol. 51, No. 4\n1069\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/4/1062/6531917 by guest on 01 April 2025\nearly-stage and undiagnosed smoking-related morbidity,\nwhich reduced the apparent protection. Likewise, the asso-\nciation was slightly stronger in men than women. These ex-\nploratory findings need confirmation.’\nResults in context with other literature\nThe systematic review of the association between smoking\nand COVID-19 reported that smoking prevalence in peo-\nple with COVID-19 was below the national smoking prev-\nalence in most studies, and former smoking prevalence was\nsimilar to the national prevalence.4 The meta-analysis\nreported in the Introduction suggested that current smok-\ning was associated with a lower risk of infection than never\nsmoking\nbut\nuncertainty\nover\nmore\nsevere\ndisease.4\nHowever, all these data were not adjusted for confound-\ning, which is a particular concern because the age profiles\nof current, former and never smokers are likely to differ.\nOur data therefore extend these findings considerably, by\nproviding a community cohort with prospective registra-\ntion of smoking status and a range of markers of severe\nCOVID-19. A population study similar to ours showed a\nreduced risk of COVID-19 death associated with current\nsmoking in an analysis adjusted for smoking-related mor-\nbidity, with an HR of 0.89 (0.82 to 0.97).7 Taken together,\nthe data suggest that smoking is associated with a reduced\nrisk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19,\nbut it remains unclear whether nicotine use without smok-\ning is associated with a similar reduction in risk. However,\na\nrecent\nstudy\ncombined\nobservational\nanalysis\nand\nMendelian randomiaztion data using the UK Biobank co-\nhort and reported that current smoking was associated\nwith elevated risk of severe COVID-19.20 Only around 3%\nof the cohort smoked as this was a population implicitly se-\nlected by interest in health, which clouds the observational\ndata. Such concerns should not apply to the Mendelian\nrandomiation data, however, and the conflicting results\nare hard to reconcile.\nIt would be possible to explain the results in our study\nand the systematic review through behaviour. People who\nsmoke were warned about increased risk from smoking\nand may have been more rigorously social distancing.\nHowever, a cross-sectional study in England reported that\npeople who smoked had an odds ratio of 0.70 (0.62 to\n0.78) for adhering to Government guidelines, with an odds\nratio of 4.9 (4.4 to 5.4) for ‘living life as normal’.21\nImplications\nOur data and at least some of the accumulated evidence\nmay suggest that cigarette smoke contains one or more\nchemicals that reduce risk, and nicotine is a plausible\ncandidate with several possible mechanisms. One study\nreported that nicotine downregulates the ACE2 receptor, to\nwhich SARS-CoV-2 attaches,22 but other studies have found\nthe opposite.23 Nicotine may also be anti-inflammatory.\nNicotinic alpha-7 agonists reduce the severity of pancreatitis\nand peritonitis in animal models,24,25 with infusions of nico-\ntine causing decreased immune cell influx and reduced pro-\ninflammatory cytokine release, which may be relevant in\nCOVID-19. Smoking alters the distribution of T-helper\ncells, particularly shifting the balance between Th1, Th2\nand Th17 cells, thereby influencing cytokine release, a cru-\ncial part of severe COVID-19 disease.26 Alpha-4 and alpha-\n7 nicotinic receptors play important roles in regulating B\ncell lines.26 Nicotine administration reduces the prolifera-\ntion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.27 Stimulation of alpha-7\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptors activates murine macro-\nphages inhibiting the transcription of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines,\nwhich\nmay\nbe\nrelevant\nin\nCOVID-19.28\nFurthermore, activated a7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptors (nAChR) suppressed the phosphorylation of\nIkappa B kinase (IjB), downregulating nuclear translocation\nof nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B\ncells (NFjB).29,30 NFjB is activated in response to interleu-\nkin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)\nrelease and in turn enables expression of cytokines, chemo-\nkines and other adhesion molecules.31 These mechanisms\nmay partially explain why nicotine can induce remission in\nulcerative colitis.32 In our study there was no evidence, how-\never, that people consuming nicotine without smoking were\nat reduced risk, but further preclinical and clinical studies\nshould examine this.\nFrom the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, people\nwho smoke have been warned of their excess risk from\nCOVID-19. However, although there are contrary studies,\nthe body of studies does not generally show there to be any\nsubstantial risk. In England, record numbers of people\nhave stopped smoking during the SARS-COV-2 epi-\ndemic,33 which could be as a result of heightened health\nconcerns. Our data join many other studies in showing the\nrisks of smoking and the benefits of quitting on mortality34\nwhere, even at the height of the English SARS-CoV-2 epi-\ndemic, all-cause mortality remained higher among people\ncurrently smoking than those who had stopped, despite a\nlower death rate from COVID-19. However uncomfort-\nable, public messaging on smoking should reflect the state\nof scientific evidence: honesty over which appears to be\nparamount in maintaining public trust.35 Whereas there\nare no direct data suggesting that nicotine is the compound\nin cigarette smoke that may protect against SARS-CoV-2,\nthese results and previous experience with nicotine in in-\nflammatory bowel disease support testing nicotine as a\ntreatment for COVID-19.\n1070\nInternational Journal of Epidemiology, 2022, Vol. 51, No. 4\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/51/4/1062/6531917 by guest on 01 April 2025\nConclusions\nCurrent smoking was associated with a reduced risk of se-\nvere COVID-19 but the association with e-cigarette use\nwas unclear. All-cause mortality remained higher despite\nthis possible reduction in death from COVID-19 during an\nepidemic of SARS-CoV-2.

In this meta-analysis, we systematically\nexamined the association between smoking and mortality in COVID-19.\nMethods\nPubMed database was searched to look for relevant articles. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) cohort\nstudies or case series studies; (2) study population included individuals with a confirmed COVID-19\ninfection; (3) the status of smoking was reported, regardless if it was current or in the past; and (4) mortality\namong smokers was reported in the study or could be calculated and compared to non-smokers. Mortality\nrates were pooled using a random effects model. Risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were also\ncalculated using the same model. Another meta-analysis was then performed to assess the difference in\nmortality between current and former smokers.\nResults\nTen studies with a total of 11,189 patients were included. Mortality among smokers was 29.4% compared to\n17.0% among non-smokers. RR was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.69). Based on analysis of four studies (532\npatients), there was no difference in mortality risk between current and former smokers (RR: 1.03; 95% CI:\n0.75, 1.40).\nConclusions\nSmoking, current or past, is associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality among\ncurrent smokers was about 50% greater than former smokers, but the difference was not statistically\nsignificant.\nCategories: Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Epidemiology/Public Health\nKeywords: smoking, covid-19, mortality, sars-cov-2\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-\n2), is a current active pandemic and major healthcare concern. The mortality rate among all patients with\nCOVID-19 infection might reach up to 15.2%, and as high as 53.4% among patients in the intensive care\nunit [1,2]. Our understanding of factors associated with higher mortality is still evolving. Recent reports\nshow that mortality is higher among patients with hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD), hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular disease, as well as in older\nmen [2,3]. There is intense interest in studying the impact of modifiable host factors, such as smoking, on\nthe severity of COVID-19 infection for early identification of individuals at higher risk of mortality and\ntargeted prevention of adverse outcomes.\nSmoking has been reported to be a risk factor for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and\nis associated with higher intensive care costs in a dose-dependent fashion [4,5]. Theoretically, smoking\ncould impact outcomes of COVID-19 patients directly by enhancing inflammation and impairing endothelial\nfunction in the cardiopulmonary systems. However, studies related to the effect of smoking on the severity\nof COVID-19 infection have reported conflicting results. While some studies reported no significant\nassociation between smoking and the severity of the disease in patients with COVID-19 [6], others reported\na more severe form of the disease among smokers [7-9].\nWe examined the effect of smoking on mortality in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection.\n1\n1\n1\n \nOpen Access Original\nArticle\n DOI: 10.7759/cureus.10837\nHow to cite this article\nSalah H M, Sharma T, Mehta J (October 07, 2020) Smoking Doubles the Mortality Risk in COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of Recent Reports and\nPotential Mechanisms. Cureus 12(10): e10837. DOI 10.7759/cureus.10837\nMaterials And Methods\nSearch strategy\nA systematic review was conducted in the PubMed database to identify articles that examined the\nassociation between smoking and COVID-19 using the following keywords: (“smoking” and “COVID-19”),\n(“smoker” and “COVID-19”), and (“smokers” and “COVID-19”) from inception until July 26, 2020. No\nlanguage restriction was applied.\nStudy selection\nFor the meta-analysis, only studies that compared mortality between smokers with COVID-19 infection and\nnon-smokers with COVID-19 infection were included. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) cohort studies;\n(2) study population included individuals with a confirmed COVID-19 infection; (3) the status of smoking\nwas reported, regardless if it was current or in the past; and (4) mortality among smokers was reported in the\nstudy or could be calculated and compared to non-smokers. All other studies were excluded.\nData extraction\nFor each study, the data screening and abstraction were performed by two independent authors (H.S. and\nT.S.). All discrepancies were resolved by consensus.\nData analysis\nThe pooled sample was divided into two groups: (1) patients with COVID-19 infection who were current or\nformer smokers and (2) patients with COVID-19 infection who never smoked. Mortality rates from the\nincluded studies were pooled using a random-effect model, which assumes that the included studies in our\nmeta-analysis represent a random sample of effect sizes. Risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI)\nwere calculated using the same model. Cochran's Q and I2 index were used for heterogeneity estimation. An\nI2 index of <25% was considered low heterogeneity, whereas an I2 index of >80% was considered high\nheterogeneity. An I2 index between 25% and 80% was considered moderate heterogeneity. We used a funnel\nplot to test for potential publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding the two studies\nwith the largest weight. All statistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.4 Software.\nResults\nWe initially identified 286 studies. After careful assessment by applying the inclusion criteria, only 10\nstudies with a total of 11,189 patients were included (Figure 1). Out of those, 1,867 patients were smokers,\ncurrent or past. Mortality among smokers was 29.4% compared to 17.0% among non-smokers. RR was 2.07\n(95% CI: 1.59, 2.69). I2 index was 74%, suggesting moderate heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis yielded\nconsistent results. In the meta-analysis that compared mortality between current and former smokers, only\nfour studies were included with a total of 532 patients. Mortality among current smokers was 32.1%, whereas\nmortality among former smokers was 21.5%. RR was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.40), suggesting a non-statistically\nsignificant increase. I2 index was 10%, suggesting low heterogeneity (Figures 2, 3).\n2020 Salah et al. Cureus 12(10): e10837.

Smoking,\ncurrent or past, was associated with a nearly two-fold higher mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.\nThis association of smoking with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients can be explained by several\nmechanisms. These potential mechanisms are graphically shown in Figure 4.\nFIGURE 4: Mechanisms that might explain the higher mortality rate\n2020 Salah et al. Cureus 12(10): e10837. DOI 10.7759/cureus.10837\n4 of 6\ng\np\ng\ny\namong smokers with COVID-19 infection compared to non-smokers.\nACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19,\ncoronavirus disease 2019; CVD, cardiovascular disease; DM, diabetes mellitus\nSmokers are more prone to more severe infections due to poor mucociliary clearance and an exaggerated\ncellular response marked by oxidative stress, increased permeability, mucus overproduction, and release of\npro-inflammatory cytokines [10,11]. Smokers are therefore more likely to develop ARDS and do worse with\nrespiratory diseases owing to a lowered pulmonary reserve and altered physiology.\nSARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to gain entry into the respiratory\nepithelial cells [12]. A recent study has shown that smoking increases the expression of ACE2 in the\nsecretory cells of the respiratory tract [13]. Although the association between ACE2 expression and the\ndisease severity in COVID-19 patients is still not well understood, it is possible that high ACE2 expression in\nsmokers might play a role in the adverse outcome observed among this population by either direct epithelial\ncell damage or through downstream events of the inflammatory cascade.\nSmoking can alter the innate and adaptive immune systems and can result in exacerbation of pathological\nimmune responses and attenuation of normal physiological functions of the immune system [14].\nAdditionally, the redox imbalance associated with smoking can activate nuclear-factor-kB and activator\nprotein-1, which lead to gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, interleukin-\n8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Evolving evidence supports the concept that uncontrolled\noverproduction of similar inflammatory mediators, i.e., “cytokine storm”, plays a crucial role in the\noccurrence of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 [15,16]. The occurrence of this cytokine storm is associated\nwith worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection and is another mechanism by which smoking can contribute to\nhigher mortality among these patients [17].\nAdditionally, smoking can cause pulmonary endothelial damage and, thus, an abnormal barrier\nfunction [18]. This can subsequently increase alveolar permeability and the risk of pulmonary edema.\nSmoking further contributes to vascular dysfunction by promoting a hypercoagulable state and is an\nindependent risk factor for thromboembolism [19]. COVID-19 has been noted to be associated with a\nhypercoagulable state, which is associated with worse outcomes [20].\nIn addition to the direct pathological cascade associated with smoking, the presence of pre-existing\ncomorbidities seems to contribute to worse outcomes. Smoking is an independent risk factor for developing\nCOPD, DM, and cardiovascular disease [21-23]. In multiple studies, the presence of these comorbidities led\nto poor outcomes and more severe disease in COVID-19 [2,3,8,19].\nWhile our analysis shows worse in-hospital and immediate mortality among smokers with COVID-19\ninfection as compared to non-smokers, we would anticipate higher long-term morbidity among COVID-19\nsurvivors who currently smoke. In a study investigating six-month health utility outcomes among survivors\nof ARDS, smoking is associated with worse quality of life among this population [24]. This would be of\ninterest as we attempt to understand more about the sequelae of COVID-19 infection and the interplay of\nacute infection with pre-existing health factors.\nThere are several limitations of the results of this meta-analysis. First, all meta-analyses have the inherent\nlimitations of including studies with different populations, although we tried to include studies with similar\npatient populations as indicated by I2 index of 74%, suggesting moderate heterogeneity. Second, there may\nwell be an interaction between smoking and the prevalence of other co-morbidities, such as DM and\nhypertension, which was not studied. Lastly, we could not study the quantity and duration of smoking with\nincreased mortality in COVID-19 patients in our analysis.\nConclusions\nDespite the inherent limitation of this meta-analysis, we show that smoking is associated with a\nsignificantly higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Although the difference in mortality\nbetween current and past smokers was not statistically significant, it appeared to be about 50% greater in\ncurrent smokers.\nAdditional Information\nDisclosures\nHuman subjects: All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.\nAnimal subjects: All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.\nConflicts of interest: In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the\nfollowing: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from\n2020 Salah et al.

From a\nhistorical perspective, Lippi et al's conclusion has intriguing paralle-\nlisms with a long-standing, scientific battle already settled.\nIn 1951, Doll & Hill launched the British Doctors’ Study with the\naim of prospectively resolving the controversy surrounding the causal\nrelationship between active smoking and cancer [2]. This herculean\neffort was justified, since strong evidence had emerged in earlier years,\nalthough previous case-control studies did not bear out causal in-\nferences [3]. The lack of prospective data impeded a consensus among\nthe medical community and, among the most illustrious skeptics was\nRonald Fisher, father of frequentist statistics [4]. The British Doctors’\nStudy was one of the most protracted studies in the history of medicine.\nThe latest paper was signed by Richard Doll in 2004, shortly before his\ndemise at the age of 92 [5]. However, in the 50s, when the study began,\nmost of the Western adult population smoked and the yearly mortality\nrate was tremendous. Jerome Cornfield did not want to wait that long\nand, in 1951, applied Bayesian statistics for the first time to reveal the\ncausal association between smoking and cancer [6]. It was a novel way\nto analyze health data, hastening by several decades the proof that\nsmoking impacts the incidence of lung cancer and its mortality using\nfrequentist analyses, as Sharon McGrayne so judiciously states in the\nbook “The Theory that Would Not Die” [7].\nTherefore, we have done nothing more than to perceive a troubling\nparallelism while reading the results of Lippi et al, categorically de-\nnying that active smoking worsens the course of Covid-19 [1]. Beyond\npublic health considerations, the authors must know that the conclu-\nsions they reach do no derive from their data, which is a classic example\nof the well-known “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”\nerror [8]. Under the frequentist paradigm, Lippi's meta-analysis must be\ninterpreted as an inconclusive outcome. According to the null hypoth-\nesis significance testing framework, if H0 is not rejected, judgment\nshould basically be suspended.\nIn contrast and as Jerome Cornfield proved [6], Bayesian analyses\naddress inference about research questions more directly and in-\ntuitively [9]. Consequently, they can be a more fitting option for meta-\nanalysis based on just a few studies, as in this case, as they are better\nable to resolve the problem of inter-study heterogeneity [10]. In par-\nticular, Bayesian models estimate the probability of the parameters\ndirectly, bearing in mind the available data, which is not what the\nfrequentist confidence interval pursues [11].\nSmoking damages the airway and fosters the development of COPD\nand worsens outcomes during the course of bronchial infections [12].\nTherefore, as Cornfield did decades ago [6] to establish a direct esti-\nmate of the probability that active smoking worsens Covid-19, we have\nreanalyzed Lippi et al's data using a Bayesian random-effects model\nperformed by the R bayesmeta package [10]. The model assumes a\nnormal prior (with mean 0, no effect in the logarithmic odds ratio scale,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.05.038\nReceived 22 May 2020; Accepted 24 May 2020\nEuropean Journal of Internal Medicine 77 (2020) 129–131\nAvailable online 28 May 2020\n0953-6205/ © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

As for the het-\nerogeneity parameter τ, we chose a half-Student-t prior with scale 0.5,\nas recommended in the literature [10]. The code and data are available\nupon request to the authors. Fig. 1 displays the forest plot. The Bayesian\nmeta-analysis suggests that active smoking increases the severity of\nCovid-19 with an odds ratio of 1.79 (95% credible interval, 0.86-4.13).\nThere is a 95% posterior probability of the disease following a worse\ncourse in a smoker versus a non-smoker; thus, Lippi et al's categorical\nconclusion based on the frequentist analysis does not hold up. Fig. 2\nshows the distribution of log odds ratio that tilts broadly to the right of\n0, revealing a deleterious effect of smoking on the evolution of Covid-\n19. This conclusion is more compatible with both the data available, as\nwell as the impact of active smoking in patients with pneumonia and\nother infections [13,14]. Moreover, given the aggressiveness Covid-19\ndisplays in the airway, it would be bizarre that it should be the only\nrespiratory disease not affected by smoking. The discrepancy between\nthe conclusion reached by Lippi et al and the true message contained in\nthe data is a good example of the danger of misreading non-significant\nor inconclusive frequentist results [8]. Therefore, as in the 1950s, if you\nare a smoker, the Bayesian analysis provides you with yet another good\nreason to quit in times of Covid-19.\nFig. 1. Forest plot.

A large amount of scientiﬁc\nliterature has emerged since 2019, but none of these studies have focused on assessing\nthe impact of COVID-19 on smoking consumption. We aimed to analyse the changes\nin smoking consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic through longitudinal studies.\nThis systematic review follows the PRISMA Statement. This study was registered on\nPROSPERO (CRD42021282235). MEDLINE, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, Web of\nScience and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to 24 October 2021.\nWe completed an extensive assessment of all prospective cohort studies that aimed to\nexplore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco consumption habits. According\nto the PICOS’s acronym, we included all population (P) types and studies developed\nbefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic (I) with a change in nicotine consumption as\nthe outcome (O), as well as prospective cohort studies. The risk of bias was assessed\nusing the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The results showed that 14\ncohorts reported in 11 articles fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria. A total of 58,052 participants\nwere included in the review. Most of the studies pointed out a reduction in the number of\ncigarettes and e-cigarettes consumed from baseline (before the pandemic) to follow-up\n(during the pandemic). Only two studies reported an increase in cigarette or e-cigarette\nconsumption from baseline to follow-up. The majority of studies presented a low risk\nof bias. In conclusion, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behavior is\ncomplex and uncertain. The decrease in smoking consumption during the pandemic\ncould be related to the fear of becoming infected by COVID-19, the advancement of\nCOVID-19, and the reduction in social gatherings. In several cases, the increases in\nnicotine consumption can be explained by psychological distress. These ﬁndings can\nbe used to create strategies to prevent relapses during the post-vaccination phases of\nthe pandemic.\nSystematic Review Registration: PROSPERO, identiﬁer: CRD42021282235.\nKeywords: COVID-19, smoking, prospective cohort studies, systematic review, mental health, tobacco\nAlmeda and Gómez-Gómez\nCOVID19 and Smoking Consumption: Systematic Review\nINTRODUCTION\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identiﬁed for\nthe ﬁrst time in Wuhan (China) on 31 December 2019 (1). For\nover 2 years, the global pandemic caused 528,816,317 conﬁrmed\ncases of COVID-19 and 6,294,969 deaths on 1 June 2022, while\n11,947,644,522 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide\n(2). During these 2 years, the governments declared lockdown\nand\nimposed\nseveral\ncontainment\nmeasures\n(quarantine,\nisolation and social distancing) to detain the spread of the virus\n(3–5). These measures have detained the virus contagion and\nhave generated a worsening in mental health and impacted\nhealth behaviors (6–8).\nDue to containment measures, lockdowns and the global\ncrisis caused by the pandemic, the population has inevitably\nsuﬀered from changes in health behaviors such as sleep, substance\nabuse, physical activity and diet, which could have long-term\nconsequences on global health (9). It is worth highlighting\nthat the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than a health\ncrisis, which has impacted society and the economy, increasing\npoverty and inequalities globally (10). The pandemic has also\ngenerated psychosocial and socioeconomic insecurities that\nimpacted wellbeing (11). In this sense, socioeconomic conditions\nsuch as deprivation and low-income increase perceived stress\nlevels and, consequently, the development of risk behaviors such\nas daily smoking (12).\nConsidering that the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed people\nworldwide to change their daily lives and sociodemographic\nconditions (loss of job and income) and has raised their\nmental health conditions, it is expected that the coronavirus\nhas also had an impact on health risk behaviors such as\nsmoking consumption. Scientiﬁc literature points out that\nthe relationship between smoking consumption and COVID-\n19\nis\ncomplex.\nNicotine\nconsumption\ncan\nbe\nincreased\nduring the pandemic (13). Nevertheless, other studies found\nthat smoking consumption might have been reduced (14).\nFollowing the ﬁrst assumption, several studies have shown\nthat high anxiety levels, stress and isolation suﬀered during\nthe pandemic might have increased cigarette consumption\n(15). Additionally, a recent study showed that although\n46.7% of smokers thought about quitting because of COVID-\n19, most did not change their smoking habits during the\npandemic (16). On the other hand, smoking consumption\nmight have been decreased because of perceived pulmonary\npotential risks, lower access opportunities and lower social\ninteractions because of the lockdowns (17). Being scared\nof getting infected by COVID-19 and believing coronavirus\nis more severe for smokers might have decreased smoking\nconsumption (18).\nPrevious systematic reviews and meta-analyses have focused\non evaluating the impact of smoking on COVID-19 progression\nand severity. The main ﬁndings pointed out that users with\nany smoking history (currently or in the past) had an increased\nand signiﬁcant risk of developing severe symptoms and worse\nhospital outcomes in terms of mortality, disease progression and\nneed for medical ventilation (19–22). As far as we are, concerned\nthere is no systematic review assessing how the COVID-19\npandemic has aﬀected smoking consumption, which is crucial\nto identifying risk factors for wellbeing.\nThe potential eﬀect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking\nbehavior is still uncertain, and a better understanding of the\nmagnitude of nicotine consumption because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic is required to predict long-term consequences on\nglobal population health. Additionally, it is crucial to help health\nservices and policy-makers cope with the impact of COVID-19\nand provide an appropriate response. Therefore, the objective of\nthis systematic review is to analyse how the patterns of nicotine\nconsumption changed during the COVID-19 pandemic through\nlongitudinal studies.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nThis systematic review was developed following PRISMA\nguidelines (23, 24). The protocol of this study was previously\nregistered at PROSPERO on October 1, 2021 (PROSPERO ID:\nCRD42021282235). According to the protocol, a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis study were planned. However, due to\nconsiderable (I2 = 92.7%; 95% CI, 916% to 95%) and signiﬁcant\nheterogeneity between the included studies (Q18 = 264.13; p <\n0.001), the meta-analysis was not performed. These analyses were\nperformed based on Cochran’s Q statistic, its p-value and I2 index\nand its 95% CI.\nSearch Strategies\nThe search strategies were implemented in MEDLINE (via OVID\nand PubMed), ERIC (via OVID), PsycARTICLES (via OVID),\nScopus, Web of Science (WOS) and PsycINFO from database\ninception to 24 October 2021. In addition, the reference lists of\nincluded articles were reviewed manually. The search strategy\nincluded the following three sets of relevant terms: a set of words\nrelated to COVID-19, a second set made up of a combination\nof words related to tobacco consumption, and the third set of\nwords related to the design of the studies. The words included\nwithin the sets were combined with the Boolean OR, while the\nthree sets of words were combined with the Boolean AND. All\nwords were searched by title and abstract. The search was piloted\nin PubMed and then adapted to run across OVID, Scopus, WOS\nand PsycINFO. The search strategies in all databases are shown\nin Supplementary Material.\nEligibility Criteria\nThe rationale for our inclusion criteria was to have an extensive\nassessment of all prospective cohort studies that aim to explore\nthe eﬀect of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco consumption\nhabits. Following PICOS’s acronym, we included all types\nof populations (P). We aimed to explore studies developed\nbefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic (I/E) regarding\nintervention or exposure. A comparator was not applicable (C).\nThe outcome was a change in nicotine consumption habits\n(O), and the study design was exclusively prospective cohort\nstudies. No restrictions were imposed regarding publication year,\nlanguage, or study setting. Table 1 shows the inclusion and\nexclusion criteria.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org\n2\nJuly 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 941575\nAlmeda and Gómez-Gómez\nCOVID19 and Smoking Consumption: Systematic Review\nTABLE 1 | Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nCriteria\nInclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria\nPopulation\nAll population types\nNone\nOutcome\nImpact of COVID-19\nimpact on smoking\nhabits\nOther outcomes\nDesign\nProspective cohort\nstudies\nRetrospective cohort,\ncross-sectional,\ncase-control, clinical\ntrials, systematic\nreviews and\nmeta-analysis,\nprotocols, clinical case,\neditors’ letters,\nqualitative studies,\nrandomized controlled\ntrial, brief reports.\nPublication\nyear\nAll year\nNone\nLanguage\nAll languages\nNone\nSetting\nAll settings\nNone\nSelection of Studies\nTwo reviewers (NA and IGG) independently screened the studies\nin two phases to assess eligibility: (1) abstracts and title inspection\nand (2) full-text inspection. Disagreements were resolved by\nconsensus between both reviewers (NA and IGG), and in case of\ndisagreement, a third reviewer made the ﬁnal decision. The web-\nbased software Rayyan system was used for recording decisions\n(25). The initial degree of agreement between the reviewers at\nthe abstract and title inspection phases (Cohen κ = 0.43; 95%\nCI, 0.227 to 0.636) and the full-text inspection phase (Cohen\nκ = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.810 to 1.060) was moderate and very\ngood, respectively.\nData Extraction\nTwo reviewers (NA and IGG) independently extracted all\nqualitative and quantitative relevant characteristics in an Excel\nsheet speciﬁcally created for the study. Discrepancies between\nreviewers were resolved by consensus. For the qualitative\nsynthesis, ﬁrst authors & publication year, region & country,\ntarget population, sex, sample size at baseline, sample size at\nfollow-up, the main outcome, smoking consumption measure,\nnumber of smokers at baseline, number of smokers at follow-\nup results were extracted. The corresponding authors of the\nincluded studies were contacted to request more information\nwhen necessary.\nPrevious evidence suggests that the strictness of government\npolicies taken to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic have an\ninﬂuence on tobacco use behaviors (26, 27). Thus, a part from\nthe variables reported above, the COVID-19 stringency index (as\na measure of country-level response to COVID-19) created by the\nOxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT),\nwas used (28) to calculate the mean daily COVID-19 stringency\nindex. The COVID-19 stringency index uses nine criteria\n(school and work closures, restrictions on public gatherings,\nannulment of public events, closures of public transport, stay-at-\nhome requirements, public information campaigns, restrictions\non internal movements, and international travel controls) to\ncalculate an index that ranges from 0 to 100. The higher the score,\nthe greater the restrictive response. The mean daily COVID-\n19 stringency index was calculated for each study taking into\naccount the follow-up period of each study. To do so, the daily\nCOVID-19 stringency indexes during the periods, in which the\nfollow-up of each study was carried out, have been sum and\ndivided by the total number of days included in the follow-up.\nAssessment of Risk of Bias\nThe risk of bias in the included studies was measured\nindependently by two reviewers (NA and IGG) using the\nNewcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies (NOS) (29).\nThe NOS scale consists of eight items divided across three\ndomains: (1) selection of the cohort, (2) comparability of the\ncohort and (3) outcome. Each study is evaluated through the\nassignment of stars. Each study can only receive one star for each\nitem in the selection and outcome categories and a maximum of\ntwo stars for comparability. The stars designate the items with a\nlow risk of bias. Thus, according to the NOS scale, the risk of bias\nin each study might be interpreted as follows: very high risk of\nbias (0–3 stars), high risk of bias (4–6 stars), and low risk of bias\n(7–9 stars) (30).\nRESULTS\nSelection of the Studies\nA total of 1,300 records were found through databases, and\n9 records were found through other sources (reference lists\ninspection of the included articles in full-text screening). After\neliminating duplicates, 509 records remained and were reviewed\nfor the title and abstract inspection. Of these, 31 studies met\nthe inclusion criteria and were reviewed for full-text inspection.\nFinally, 14 cohorts reported in 11 publications met the inclusion\ncriteria for the systematic review (see Figure 1). We must\nnote that the study of García-Esquinas et al. (31) included\nfour diﬀerent cohort studies (ENRICA cohort study, ES cohort\nstudy, TSHA cohort study and Exernet cohort study) in the\nsame publication.\nCharacteristics of the Included Studies\nTable 2 shows the qualitative characteristics of the included\nstudies. A total of 58052 participants were included across 14\ncohorts reported in 11 publications. The sample size ranged from\n295 (35) to 22,823 (34) (median = 1,642). All of the included\nstudies were published in 2021. A total of 45.5% (n = 5) of the\nstudies were conducted in Europe (31, 33, 34, 37, 40), while 36.4%\n(n = 4) were conducted in the USA (32, 35, 38, 42) and 18.2% (n\n= 2) in Asia (39, 41).\nRelated to the target population, four (36.4%) of the studies\nincluded adolescents (32, 36, 37, 40), three (27.3%) included\nyoung adults (33, 35, 38), two (18.2%) included adults (34, 39)\nand two (18.2%) included older adults (31, 41).\nFive studies (45.5%) reported changes in nicotine, smoking\nor tobacco consumption as the main outcome (32, 33, 35–37).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org\n3\nJuly 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 941575\nAlmeda and Gómez-Gómez\nCOVID19 and Smoking Consumption: Systematic Review\nFIGURE 1 | PRISMA 2020 ﬂow diagram of the studies included.\nThree studies (27.3%) reported changes in cigarette use as the\nmain outcome (34, 38, 40), and two studies (18.2%) reported\nchanges in smoking status (31, 41). In addition, four studies\n(36.4%) reported information about e-cigarette consumption (32,\n34, 38, 40).\nRegarding the smoking consumption measure, all studies\nused self-reported questions about nicotine, smoking or tobacco\nconsumption; smoking status; the number of cigarettes/e-\ncigarettes smoked over a speciﬁc period; and the number of days\nusing tobacco products over a speciﬁc period. Of those, three\nstudies (27.3%) reported both self-reported nicotine/smoking\nconsumption and self-reported number of days using cigarettes\nor number of cigarettes smoked over a speciﬁc period (32, 34, 35).\nThe percentage of cigarette smokers at baseline (pre-COVID-\n19 pandemic) and follow-up (during COVID-19 pandemic)\nvaried across studies. At baseline, it ranges from 0% (36) to 100%\n(39), while at follow-up, it ranges from 0.7% (García-Esquinas et\nal., (31) - Exernet cohort) to 85.9% (39). Regarding the number\nof e-cigarette smokers, a lower prevalence was observed than in\ntraditional cigarettes. It ranged from 11.3% (32) to 48.7% (40)\nat baseline and from 10.8 (32) to 26.5 (38) at follow-up. The\nmajority of the studies showed a reduction in cigarette and e-\ncigarette smokers from baseline to follow-up. Only two studies\n(18.2%) reported an increase in cigarette (36) or e-cigarette (40)\nconsumption from baseline to follow-up.\nFinally, the mean daily COVID-19 stringency index varied\nfrom 47.79 to 79.63 (Mean: 67.59; SD: 8.8). The two studies\nwith the highest COVID-19 stringency index at follow-up were\nconducted in China (41) and the United Kingdom (34) and both\nof them showed a reduction in the percentage of cigarette and/or\ne-cigarette smokers.\nRisk of Bias of the Included Studies\nThe risk of bias in the included studies is shown in Table 3. All the\nstudies had a low risk of bias in the categories of representative\nof the non-exposed cohort, selection of the non-exposed cohort,\na demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at\nthe start of the study, and comparability of cohorts and adequate\nlength of follow-up. In addition, all studies except one (37) had\na low risk of bias in the adequacy of follow-up of the cohort\ncategory. Because self-reported measures were used in all of\nthe studies, a high risk of bias was observed for the categories\nof ascertainment of exposure and assessment of outcome. By\nconsidering this, it can be concluded that all studies except one\n(37) presented a low risk of bias.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this systematic review, we aimed to analyse how the patterns of\nnicotine consumption changed during the COVID-19 pandemic\nthrough longitudinal studies.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review\nassessing the impact of COVID-19 on smoking consumption\nbehavior.

Consistent with\nprevious research, reductions in smoking consumption might\nbe explained by less diﬃculty in quitting smoking and higher\nmotivation to quit because of fear of the pandemic and COVID-\n19 negative progression (14, 18, 43). In this sense, the pandemic\nand fear of being infected by COVID-19 have motivated\npatients to quit or reduce smoking (44). Additionally, lockdowns\nworldwide and a reduction in social activities might have reduced\nthe opportunities for social smoking or even the accessibility\nto buy cigarettes (45). In this line, we have to note that the\nstudies with the highest COVID-19 mean daily stringency index\npresented reductions in the percentage of cigarette and/or e-\ncigarette smokers. According to this, United Kingdom, China\n(Rushan, Qufu and Laoling regions), Midwestern U.S.A (USA),\nPakistan and Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Toledo, Aragón and\nCastilla-La Mancha) showed the highest COVID-19 mean\ndaily stringency index and an evidenced reduction in smoking\nconsumption. However, a previous meta-analysis did not ﬁnd\nan association between prevalence of smoking and mean daily\nstringency indexes (46).\nTherefore, the evolution of the pandemic might have\npositively\nimpacted\npopulation\nwellbeing\nin\nterms\nof\nsmoking consumption.\nIceland and USA (22 study sites across the U.S.A) showed\nan increment in tobacco consumption in comparison with pre-\npandemic level (36, 40). It is worthy to highlight the case of USA,\nwhich can show patterns variations in smoking consumption\nacross diﬀerent states. This increase might be caused by feelings\nof boredom during the lockdown (47). Additionally, smoking can\nbe considered an unhealthy strategy to cope with stress, where\npeople feel that they do not control the number of cigarettes they\nconsume (48).\nThis study presents some limitations. First, following the\nPROSPERO register, a systematic review and meta-analysis\nstudy was planned. However, it was impossible to perform\nthe study’s meta-analytic part due to the high heterogeneity\nbetween studies. Regarding smoking status measures, all of the\nstudies evaluated smoking status by self-reported questions. This\nmight be explained by many of the studies assessing smoking\nas a secondary outcome. In addition, most of the studies\ncollected data through online surveys due to the exceptional\ncircumstances derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding\npopulation, we must note that many of the studies were\nfocused on young populations. Therefore, our conclusions apply\nmainly to this population proﬁle. Despite these limitations,\nthis systematic review addressed a novel topic. To the best\nof our knowledge, we must note that all previous systematic\nreviews aimed to explore the eﬀect of smoking on COVID-\n19 severity (19, 20, 49–51). Apart from that, we must note\nthat this study explore the most relevant databases in the\narea combined with extensive supplementary hand searching.\nMoreover, many participants from diﬀerent countries and\ncontinents were included, supporting its external validity.\nIn addition, Supplementary Material about the COVID-19\npandemic situation in each country during the follow-up\nperiods was included by using the COVID-19 stringency index.\nRegarding methodology, study selection, data extraction and risk\nof bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers\nfollowing the PRISMA statement.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behavior\nis complex and unclear. The results from this systematic\nreview indicate that, in most cases, smoking consumption has\ndecreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while this global\nhealth crisis has been considered a good opportunity to reduce\nor quit smoking. Fear of becoming infected by COVID-19\nand developing a maladaptive progression of the infection have\nmotivated people to drop out of this habit. Lockdown and social\nrestrictions have also played a crucial role in decreasing nicotine\nconsumption. Nevertheless, in some cases, the pandemic has\nnegatively aﬀected smoking behavior. In these cases, the increase\nin nicotine consumption during the pandemic may be caused\nby boredom, stress and anxiety. These ﬁndings support the\ndevelopment of prevention and intervention strategies during the\nrecovery phase of the pandemic to help people reduce smoking\nand avoid relapses in people who have quit.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be\ndirected to the corresponding author/s.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nNA and IG-G designed and conducted the study, prepared\nthe initial protocol draft, and revised the manuscript.

  "cai-et-al-2020-reply-to-polverino-cigarette-smoking-and-covid-19-a-complex-interaction.pdf": "smokers compared with nonsmokers in several transcriptomic\ndata sets of lung samples from healthy never- and ever-\nsmokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease. Also, they report an increase in ACE2-producing\ngoblet cells in ever-smoker versus never-smoker lungs. These\nﬁndings have putatively important implications for patients with\nCOVID-19 because ACE2 has been shown to be the receptor\nused by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells (3) and yet seem\nin contrast with the consolidated epidemiological data\nworldwide indicating a low prevalence of active smokers\namong patients with COVID-19.\nCigarette smoke induces epigenetic modiﬁcations of the\nbronchial epithelium, leading to mucous (goblet) cell metaplasia. As\ngoblet cells are a major source of ACE2 in the lung, this could, in\npart, justify the increased levels of ACE2 found by Cai and colleagues\nin lungs of smokers. However, goblet cells are also the main source of\nmucous, which provides an essential ﬁrst host barrier to inhaled\npathogens that can prevent pathogen invasion and subsequent\ninfection.\nAdditional factors could play a role in the interaction between\nactive smoking and SARS-CoV-2.\nFirst, naturally occurring structural changes in the ACE2 allelic\nvariants can interfere with the intermolecular interactions of such\nvariants with SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (4). It is conceivable that,\nupon cigarette smoke (or nicotine?) stimulation, some ACE2 allelic\nvariants that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 binding may undergo\npositive selection.\nSecond, nicotine interacts with many components of the RAS\n(renin–angiotensin system) in multiple organ systems. In the\nACE/AT-II (angiotensin II)/AT1R (angiotensin1 receptor) arm,\nnicotine increases the expression and/or activity of renin, ACE,\nand AT1R, whereas, in the compensatory ACE2/angiotensin (1–7)\narm, nicotine downregulates the expression and/or activity of\nACE2 and AT2R (5). How these ﬁndings ﬁt with the ones from\nCai and colleagues is worth investigation. Interestingly, activation\nof nicotinic receptors can lead to enhanced protease activation\nthat may cleave and activate the spike protein of SARS-CoV for\nmembrane fusion (5). This effect may counterbalance the increase\nin ACE2 levels observed in the lungs of smokers by Cai and\ncolleagues.\nThird, ACE2 knockout mice exposed to cigarette smoke\nexhibit increased pulmonary inﬂammation with activation\nof metalloproteinases (6) that could, in part, contribute to\nthe inactivation or modiﬁcation of ACE2 in the lungs of the\nsmokers.\nLast, though it is possible that cigarette smoke increases the\nACE2 expression by the bronchial epithelium, thus facilitating the\nentry of SARS-CoV-2, this does not necessarily translate into a\nhigher risk for developing COVID-19 pneumonia.\nTo conclude, what is unchallengeable is that cigarette\nsmoke is detrimental for the lungs in several ways, and further\nstudies are needed to clarify the reasons behind the reported low\nprevalence of current smokers among hospitalized patients with\nCOVID-19. The effect of current smoking on SARS-CoV-2\ninfection is a delicate and complex topic that should be addressed\nmeticulously before delivering messages that could be\nmisinterpreted. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this letter at\nwww.atsjournals.org.\nFrancesca Polverino, M.D., Ph.D.*\nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\nORCID ID: 0000-0001-9686-5698 (F.P.).\n*Corresponding author (e-mail: fpolverino@copdnet.org).\nReferences\n1.

The major opinion of\nDr. Polverino is that patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\ninclude fewer than expected numbers of smokers. However,\nDr. Polverino cites a recent study showing a 1.8-fold higher risk\nfor death among current smokers (1). The overall lower-than-\nexpected prevalence of smoking reported in retrospective and/or\nobservational databases is most likely because of incomplete or\nincorrect information about smoking patterns. Indeed, some\nearly reports did not include smoking demographics in\npatients with severe COVID-19 (2, 3), suggesting that smoking\nhistory may be overlooked in these patients. Therefore, “the\nThis article is open access and distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives License 4.0 (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

In our opinion, “a low prevalence of\nactive smokers among patients with COVID-19” has\nbeen translated too quickly in public news with potentially\nharmful consequences. An alarming number of non–peer-\nreviewed and shoddy ecological studies of smoking and\ncoronavirus have appeared online, which can be harmful. In\ncontrast, an increased risk for severe COVID-19 is very well\ndocumented to be associated with a history of smoking (1,\n4–6), although making a special distinction between former,\nactive, or never-smokers is important because chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains highly\nunderdiagnosed (7).\nOur reader also raised a concern regarding the role of goblet\ncells in COPD, stating that mucus “.provides an essential ﬁrst host\nbarrier to inhaled pathogens.,” implying that the increased mucus\nseen in COPD protects from airway infections, especially viral\ninfections. However, no citations are provided, and we know of\nno evidence to support this concept. In contrast to this opinion,\nincreased mucus production is a common mechanism leading\nto alterations of the lung microbiota of smokers with chronic\nbronchitis, pulmonary function of whom regularly and highly\npredictably deteriorates after acute disease exacerbations that are\nprecipitated by intercurrent infections caused by viruses, bacteria,\nand fungi (5, 8–10).\nThe concept that ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)\nvariants that inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding may be upregulated\n(positively selected) because of cigarette smoking is an interesting\none, but it is one that is not supported by any direct data and,\nfurthermore, not supported by any genetic regulatory mechanism\nthat we are aware of.\nNicotine has been shown to downregulate expression of ACE2,\nbut the concept that “.activation of nicotinic receptors can lead\nto enhanced protease activation that may cleave and activate S\n(the spike protein) of SARS-CoV for membrane fusion” is not\nsupported by any scientiﬁc studies to our knowledge, and in\nour animal model of chronic exposure to nicotine via electronic\ncigarettes, we did not detect any changes in ACE2 expression\n(data not shown). Furthermore, the statement that lung\nmetalloproteinases upregulated in the ACE2-deﬁcient mouse can\nfeed back to inactivate or modify ACE2 in smokers is a non sequitur.\nDr. Polverino also acknowledges that our careful interrogation of\ndata sets revealed increased mRNA expression of ACE2 in former and\nactive smokers but provides an opinion that was not claimed in our\nletter (11). Though we showed signiﬁcant associations that we\nbelieve will provide one useful piece of the puzzle rather than\nspeculations about COVID-19–related pneumonia, we did not state\nthat increased ACE2 expression translates into worse or higher risk\nfor COVID-19 pneumonia. It is now becoming clear that the\npresence of ACE2 marks tissues vulnerable to infection (12). We\nhave thus discussed that smoking may increase risk for viral binding\nand entry of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs of smokers. Obviously, the\npathway from discovery to guiding medical decisions or making\npublic recommendations is usually not based on a single study. As\nindicated in our manuscript, further mechanistic studies are needed\nto understand the upregulation of ACE2 in lung tissues by smoking.\nFinally, we agree with Dr. Polverino that cigarette smoking is\ndetrimental. Investigators need to gauge the right level of evidence\nbefore delivering messages and aim for messages that will do more\ngood than harm, which is the baseline for research studies as well as\nscientiﬁc responses. In terms of communicating research results to\nthe public, if someone overstates our study ﬁnding and translates\nthis into a message that smoking increases your chance of SARS-\nCoV-2 infection, then this will be just one more good reason to stop\nsmoking. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this letter at\nwww.atsjournals.org.\nGuoshuai Cai, Ph.D.\nUniversity of South Carolina\nColumbia, South Carolina\nYohan Boss ´e, Ph.D.\nLaval University\nQuebec City, Quebec, Canada\nFeifei Xiao, Ph.D.\nUniversity of South Carolina\nColumbia, South Carolina\nFarrah Kheradmand, M.D.\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\nHouston, Texas\nChristopher I.

However, methods for early\ndiagnosis are limited, especially at the stage of PAH development\nbefore the onset of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure.\nMacrophages play an important role in the development and\nprogression of PAH (2). In a recent study published in the Journal,\nPark and colleagues tracked macrophages in the lung using\npositron emission tomography (PET) with 68Ga-2-(p-\nisothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid\nmannosylated human serum albumin in patients with PAH and\nanimal models (3). Some of the results of these studies were\npreviously reported in the form of an abstract (4).\nVia PET scans, Park and colleagues showed that the\ndensity of mannose receptor, a marker for macrophages, was\nsigniﬁcantly higher in patients with PAH and monocrotaline-induced\nrat PAH models (3). In addition, pulmonary hypertension–targeted\ntherapy with sildenaﬁl or macitentan reduced the density of mannose\nreceptor in the lungs of rats with PAH. These results suggest that the\ndensity of lung macrophage inﬁltration could reﬂect the severity of\nPAH. Interestingly, this study also indicates that at the early stage, only\n1 week after injection of monocrotaline, a higher density of mannose\nreceptor was found in the rat lungs. This suggests that using PET to\nmonitor lung macrophages may predict the development of PAH even\nbefore the onset of high pulmonary arterial pressure, because in the\nﬁrst week after injection of monocrotaline, the rats showed only a mild\nelevation of pulmonary arterial pressure, which did not meet the\nstandard for PAH diagnosis. Based on these results, Park and\ncolleagues concluded that lung macrophage detection via PET scans\ncould be used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for PAH. However,\nthis study raised several concerns. First, PAH is a rare disease, and PET\nis an expensive diagnostic approach with very limited availability; thus,\nit may not be realistic to use this technique to diagnose PAH in low-\nrisk populations. However, in individuals at high risk for PAH, such as\nthose with connective tissue disease or HIV infection, PET may be a\nuseful approach for diagnosing PAH, especially at the early stage before\nthe onset of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Second, the detection\nof mannose receptor to monitor macrophage inﬁltration is\nquestionable because mannose receptor is expressed not only in\nmacrophages but also in other cell types in the lung, especially tracheal\nsmooth muscle cells (5). It would be important to know whether this\nreceptor is upregulated in macrophages in PAH before concluding that\nmacrophage inﬁltration is increased in the lung during PAH, as the\nincreased PET signal could be a result of increased mannose receptor\nexpression, and not the number of macrophages. Third, the presence of\nan inﬂammatory lung disease, such as interstitial lung disease, may\naffect macrophage inﬁltration, as shown by Park and colleagues, which\nmay affect diagnostic speciﬁcity.\nOverall, this study is very interesting in that it demonstrates\ndynamic changes in mannose receptor in the lung at different time\npoints of PAH development and therapy, and provides solid\nevidence that macrophage inﬁltration (mannose receptor elevation)\nis associated with PAH development and progression. Further\nstudies, especially in humans, are needed to provide more data to\nevaluate the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of lung mannose receptor\ndensity for the diagnosis and evaluation of PAH. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this letter at\nwww.atsjournals.org.\nRuidi Tang, B.S.*\nThe First Afﬁliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University\nGuangzhou, China\nYingkang Jin, M.D., Ph.D.*\nGuangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center\nGuangzhou, China\nJing Liao, M.D.*\nLingdan Chen, M.D.\nChunli Liu, M.D., Ph.D.\nShaoqiang Li, M.D.\nJian Wang, Ph.D.\nTao Wang, M.D., Ph.D.\nWenju Lu, M.D., Ph.D.‡\nThe First Afﬁliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University\nGuangzhou, China\nORCID ID: 0000-0001-9372-1648 (T.W.).\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n‡Corresponding author (e-mail: wlu92@yahoo.com).\nReferences\n1.

Across \nthe US, 2.6 million people smoke hookah, \nand the number of “hookah bars” has \nmushroomed, with 100 million hookah \nusers globally.2,3 In Canada, its high preva-\nlence, in particular among young adults, \nis a matter of growing concern.4\nSmoking has emerged as an indepen-\ndent risk not only for transmission but \nalso for severity of coronavirus disease \n2019 (COVID-19).5 Similarly, hookahs are \nideal for transmission and may exacer-\nbate the risk for severe COVID-19 through \nshared use. They have difficult-to-clean \nlong pipes and a cold water reservoir, \nideal for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Fur-\nthermore, hookah tobacco smoke con-\ntains several hazardous chemicals that \ninjure the respiratory lining and predis-\npose the smoker to viral infections, tuber-\nculosis and other infectious diseases, and \nthe coronavirus is no exception. \nAlthough not formally reported, hoo-\nkah smoking (like e-cigarettes) could \ndisproportionately increase COVID-19 in \nyouth. Furthermore, Middle East respira-\ntory syndrome coronavirus was also \nthought to be transmitted by waterpipe \nsmoking.6\nSeveral countries have already placed \nrestrictions on hookah use, given the \npublic health risks of COVID-19 transmis-\nsion it poses. The cities of Cairo, Egypt, \nand Abu-Dhabi and Dubai in the United \nArab Emirates, recently banned hookah \nuse. In Canada, hookah use per say is \nlegal, but it is illegal in restaurants and \nbars, enclosed workplaces, and other \npublic and enclosed spaces in Ontario.7,8 \nSimilar provisions exist in Alberta and \nother provinces.9\nBased on recent advice from the World \nHealth Organization10 on COVID-19 and \nhookah use, we suggest that hookah or \nwaterpipe smoking should be regulated to \nprevent COVID-19 transmission through \nhookah smoking.\nSkand Shekhar MD \nClinical endocrinology fellow, Section on \nEndocrinology and Genetics, National \nInstitute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment, NIH, Bethesda, Md. \nFady Hannah-Shmouni MD \nDirector, Graduate Medical Education, \nNational Institute of Child Health and \nHuman Development, NIH, Bethesda, Md.\nn \u0007Cite as: CMAJ 2020 April 27;192:E462. \ndoi: 10.1503/cmaj.75332\nReferences\n  1.\t Vogel L.

Some studies have linked smoking \nwith severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have \nfound no such association.\nMethods  This was a retrospective analysis of all adults \nhospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020.\nResults  1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients \nnever smoked whereas 336 patients were either current \nsmokers or past smoker and were grouped together in \nsmokers group. Patients in smokers group were more \nlikely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19% vs 6%, \np<0.001), HIV infection (11% vs 5%,p<0.001), cancer \n(11% vs 6%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15% \nvs 8%, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (15% vs 9%, \np=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11% vs 8%, p=0.037) and \nend-­stage renal disease (10% vs 6%, p=0.009) compared \nwith non-­smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers \nwere more likely to develop critical illness requiring \nmechanical ventilation (47% vs 37% p=0.005). Univariate \nCox model for survival analysis by smoking status showed \nthat among smokers only current smokers had higher risk \nof death compared with never smokers (HR 1.61, 95% CI \n1.22 to 2.12, p<0.001). In the multivariate approach, Cox \nmodel for the survival, female sex, young age, low serum \nlactate dehydrogenase and systemic steroid use were \nassociated with overall improved survival.\nConclusion  In our large single-­centre retrospective \ndatabase of patients hospitalised with COVID-19, smoking \nwas associated with development of critical illness and \nhigher likelihood of death.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe \ncoronavirus \npandemic \nbegan \nin \nDecember 2019 and has rapidly spread glob-\nally.1 The disease is caused by SARS-­CoV-2, \nwhich belongs to the subgenu Sarbecovirus \n(Beta-­CoV lineage B), Orthocoronavirinae \nsubfamily.2 SARS-­CoV-2 predominantly affects \nthe respiratory tract by entering the alveolar \nepithelial cells via ACE2 receptors. The virus \nalso uses activation of spike proteins to enter \nthe cells.3 Symptoms vary significantly from \nan asymptomatic infection to severe acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nSmoking has been considered a risk factor \nfor many respiratory viral illnesses including \ninfluenza, MERS, RSV, and so on.4 5 Smoking \nleads to inflammation of the lung epithe-\nlium causing release of cytokines, increased \nmucous secretion, impaired mucociliary \nclearance as well as epithelial cell damage. In \na descriptive study, Guan et al1 showed that \ncurrent and former smokers were more likely \nto present with severe COVID-19 compared \nwith non-­smokers. In another small study, Liu \net al5 showed that smoking history was associ-\nated with progression of COVID-19. Contrary \nto these findings, study by Huang et al6 showed \nthat current smoking history is not associated \nwith need for intensive care unit care. Similar \nfindings were observed by subsequent larger \nobservational studies.7 8\nNicotine is known to have a role in immu-\nnomodulation and regulation of ACE 2 \nreceptors. In a recent study, ever smokers \nwere shown to have higher pulmonary ACE2 \nreceptor expression by 25% compared with \nnever smokers. These findings suggested \nthat ever smokers have increased risk of viral \nbinding and entry into the lungs.9 Current \nliterature evaluating difference in outcomes \nbetween current smokers, past smokers \nand never smokers is sparse. Our hospital is \nlocated in New York City where 13.1% of the \nKey Messages\n►\n►Does the smoking status affect outcomes of hospi-\ntalised patients with COVID-19.\n►\n►Our study shows that smokers are more likely to \npresent with severe COVID-19 illness.\n►\n►Incidentally, we noted that system steroids use was \nindependently associated with improved survival. \nWe performed a subgroup analysis by disease se-\nverity to study this association further.\nBMJ Open Respiratory Research: first published as 10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000716 on 5 October 2020.

In view of \nrecent literature suggesting improved mortality among \nhospitalised patients with COVID-19 who were treated \nwith systemic steroids, we also aimed to assess the effects \nof the use of systemic steroids in our patient population.12\nMETHODS\nStudy setting\nWe conducted this study at BronxCare Health System, \nthe largest voluntary, not-­for-­profit health and teaching \nhospital system, serving the south and central Bronx in \nthe New York City. We retrospectively analysed all consec-\nutively hospitalised adults with COVID-19 from 9 March \nto 18 May 2020. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was established \nwhen a patient tested positive for the virus SARS-­CoV-2 \nfrom the PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab speci-\nmens at any point during their hospitalisation. Need for \nconsent was waived due to retrospective nature of the \nstudy.\nParticipants and eligibility criteria\nWe included adult patients (aged 18 and above) with \nknown smoking status who were hospitalised with \nCOVID-19 for whom severity of illness could be estab-\nlished and had final disposition status at the time of the \nstudy. One thousand three hundred and thirty-­six adult \npatients were admitted with COVID-19 during the study \nperiod. Smoking status was not known for 112 patients. \nAnother 34 patients were still admitted at the time of \ndata analysis and were excluded. Seventeen patients \nwere excluded because the disease severity could not be \nestablished due to missing data elements. One thousand \none hundred and seventy-­three (87.8%) patients met the \nstudy inclusion criteria.\nDuring the study period, an inpatient guide for the \nmanagement of COVID-19 was developed by the Depart-\nment of Medicine, and distributed to all healthcare \nproviders at our hospital. Patients admitted during the \nstudy period received supportive and therapeutic modali-\nties based on individual physician’s clinical discretion and \nour inpatient guide. Based on early findings by Wu et al,13 \nuse of systemic steroids (intravenous methylpredniso-\nlone) was suggested for patients with COVID-19 induced \nARDS. Steroid use was also permitted for non-­COVID-19 \nrelated illnesses such as exacerbation of obstructive \nairway diseases. Use of tocilizumab was suggested in \npatients with evidence of disease progression (defined \nas worsening respiratory status or radiographic findings) \nand increasing inflammatory markers early in their acute \nCOVID-19 illness.14\nWe extracted our data manually from electronic \nmedical records. The data obtained included patients’ \ndemographic \ndetails, \ncomorbidities, \nself-­reported \nsmoking history, laboratory and radiological test results \n(at admission or first available), medication administra-\ntion history, and ventilator requirement data.\nStudy outcomes were defined as severity of illness and \nmortality.\nSeverity of respiratory illness\nSeverity of illness data was obtained at the worst clinical \nstate during patient admission and was defined as follows:\n►\n►Hypoxia was defined as new-­onset oxygen saturation \nof ≤94%.\n►\n►Mild illness was defined as upper respiratory illness \nwithout any evidence of pneumonia or hypoxia.\n►\n►Moderate illness was defined as radiographic evidence \nof pneumonia without hypoxia.\n►\n►Severe illness was defined as radiographic evidence \nof pneumonia with hypoxia requiring any form of \nsupplemental oxygen or non-­invasive positive pres-\nsure ventilation.\n►\n►Critical illness was defined as need for invasive \nmechanical ventilation.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used univariate analysis χ2 test for comparing categor-\nical variables between smokers and non-­smokers. Because \nthe normality assumption was violated for continuous \nvariables, the non-­parametric Mood’s median test was \nused to compare the two groups. To compare the survival \ntimes, log-­rank test was used. Additionally, the Kaplan-­\nMeier estimates were plotted.\nIn the multivariate approach, Cox model was used for \nmodelling survival times with all baseline characteristics. \nIn the Cox multivariate regression, stepwise backward \nselection was used with p>0.1 for removal. The propor-\ntionality of the hazards assumption in a Cox model was \ntested using Schoenfeld residuals. We also performed a \nlog rank analysis in critically ill patients to assess signif-\nicance of systemic steroids. Statistical analyses were \nperformed with the use of STATA software V.14.2.\nRESULTS\nOne thousand one hundred and seventy-­three patients \nmet the study criteria and were included in final analysis. \nOf these, 837 (71.4%) patients never smoked and 336 \n(28.6%) were either current smokers or had smoked in \nthe past. There was no difference between the smokers \nand non-­smokers with regards to age or body mass index. \nSmokers were more likely to be males and African Amer-\nicans. Smokers were more likely to have chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary disease (19% vs 6%, p<0.001), HIV infec-\ntion (11% vs 5%, p<0.001), cancer (11% vs 6%, p=0.005), \ncongestive heart failure (15% vs 8%, p<0.001), coronary \nartery disease (15% vs 9%, p=0.027), chronic kidney \ndisease (11% vs 8%, p=0.04), and end-­stage renal disease \n(10% vs 6%, p=0.009) compared with non-­smokers \n(table 1).

Of these, \n235 patients were critically ill, 72 had severe illness, 84 \nhad moderate illness and 35 patients had mild COVID-19 \nrelated illness. To compare the survival times, log-­rank \ntest was used for severely ill and critically ill patients. \nAdditionally, the Kaplan-­Meier estimates were plotted. \nNo significant differences in outcomes were observed for \nseverely ill patients (p=0.29). In critically ill patients, anal-\nysis revealed that median survival time was 13 days (95% \nCI 12 to 14 days) for patients who received systemic ster-\noids compared with 6 days (95% CI 5 to 7 days) for those \nwho did not (p<0.0001; figure 2).\nDISCUSSION\nOur study evaluated the patients that were admitted \nto our institution during the heart of the COVID-19 \npandemic. We looked at various data points and how \nthey correlated to the severity of COVID-19 infection. \nWe found a direct relationship between smoking and \nseverity of illness as well as mortality. When we subdi-\nvided smokers into current smokers and past smokers, we \nnoticed that only current smokers had higher mortality \ncompared with never smokers. This finding is in contrast \nwith the recently published literature that showed signif-\nicant upregulation of pulmonary ACE2 gene expression \nin both current and past smokers. The study suggested \nthis upregulation increases risk of viral binding and \nentry of the virus into the lungs of both current and past \nsmokers.9\nAnother significant finding of our study was that 28.6% \nof our patients had smoked at some point in their lives. \nThis number is higher than what has been reported in \nthe recent literature. In two meta-­analyses, pooled preva-\nlence of smokers in hospitalised patients was 7.6% (3.8%–\n12.4%) and 6.5% (1.4%–12.6%).15 16 From calendar year \n2012 to year 2016, New York City has seen a significant \ndecrease in the percentage of adults who smoke.10 This \nreduction has been attributed to comprehensive strate-\ngies that include media campaigns, smoke free air policies \nand increased access to cessation resources. Nonetheless, \n13.1% of the adult living in New York City still smoke ciga-\nrettes.10 In our study, 164 patients (13.9%) were current \nsmokers which correlates with the prevalence data of the \nNew York City. Given similar rates of current smokers in \nour cohort of patients compared with that of the general \npopulation of New York City, the current study cohort is \nrepresentative.\nSurvival analysis further revealed that women were at \nlower risk of mortality than men (HR of 0.67), which is \nconsistent with recently published data.17 While exact \nmechanism that confers protection to females is not \nknown, a study showed that the circulating ACE2 levels \nare higher in men than in women.18 These findings may \nsuggest why men are at higher risk of developing serious \nCOVID-19 illness. Increased age and serum LDH levels \nwere also shown to be independently associated with \nsurvival. In addition, our data showed that patients who \nreceived systemic steroids were more likely to survive. \nOn further analysis, this finding was not significant for \nseverely ill patients. Critically ill patients showed signif-\nicant survival advantage with use of systemic steroids. \nSystemic steroids in COVID-19 have been much of \ncontroversy.

BMJ Open Resp Res 2020;7:e000716. doi:10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000716\nOpen access\nMarch 2020 advised to avoid routine use system steroids \nfor treatment of viral pneumonia.19 A literature review \nby Russel et al20 went even further and stated that not \nonly that the evidence does not support any benefit but \nthere may even be harm if steroids are used in patients \nwith COVID-19. Wu et al13 subsequently published their \nfindings in a subgroup of patients with COVID-19 who \ndeveloped ARDS. Their study showed that patients who \nreceived methylprednisolone were more likely to survive \ncompared with those who did not. This study was one of \nthe key considerations when our institutional protocol \nsuggested the use of systemic steroids in select subgroup \nof patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Our results \nconfirm the findings by Wu et al13 in suggesting bene-\nfits of systemic steroids use in critically ill patients. Our \nstudy results are also in line with recovery trial findings \nthat showed that use of dexamethasone resulted in lower \n28-­day mortality (29.3% vs 41.4%; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.81) \namong those patients with COVID-19 illness who required \nmechanical ventilation. In addition, recovery trial also \nfound a mortality benefit in patients with COVID-19 who \nwere receiving oxygen therapy (23.3% vs 26.2%; 95% CI \n0.72 to 0.94), which our study did not show.12\nOur study has several limitations. First, this is a single \ncentre, retrospective study, and therefore at risk of selec-\ntion bias. Second, as this study includes patients that were \nadmitted during the COVID-19 crisis, many of whom \nwere seriously ill to provide detailed history, data were \nlimited with regards to pack year smoking as well as how \nlong ago past smokers quit smoking. Third, we did not \naccount for other inhaled recreational agents such as \nmarijuana. Finally, our study tested multiple hypotheses, \nyet not all confounders may be accounted for in multivar-\niate models. Our findings need further confirmation in a \nlarger prospective cohort.\nCONCLUSION\nOur study findings suggest that smoking is associated with \nhigher likelihood of developing critical illness and higher \nlikelihood of death in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 \nillness. Use of systemic steroids in critically ill patients was \nindependently associated with improved survival.\nAcknowledgements  The authors want to thank Magdalena Murawska for \nperforming the statistical analysis.\nContributors  All authors have made substantial contributions to all of the \nfollowing: (1) the conception and design of the study, acquisition of data, analysis \nand interpretation of data, (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for \nimportant intellectual content, (3) final approval of the version to be submitted.\nFunding  The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any \nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-­for-­profit sectors.\nCompeting interests  None declared.\nPatient and public involvement  Patients and/or the public were not involved in \nthe design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.\nPatient consent for publication  Not required.\nEthics approval  This study was approved by the institutional review board at \nBronxcare Health System under an expedited review in the setting of a global \npandemic (IRB # 06 11 20 09).

However, it remains controversial with respect to the relationship of\nsmoking with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of smoking\nin COVID-19.\nMethods: A total of 622 patients with COVID-19 in China were enrolled in the study.\nCorresponding clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Meanwhile,\nKaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were employed to analyze the\nassociation of smoking with survival in patients with COVID-19.\nResults: Smoking was statistically signiﬁcant comparing non-survivors and survivors\nof patients with COVID-19 (P = 0.007). Males had higher proportion of smoking than\nfemales (91.9% vs. 8.1%, P < 0.001). Compared with the non-smoker, there was\nsigniﬁcant statistical difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in smoking\npatients with COVID-19 (9.7% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.017). White blood cell count (6.3 vs.\n5.4; P = 0.037), hemoglobin level (139.0 vs. 127.0; P < 0.001), and creatinine level\n(77.3 vs. 61.0; P < 0.001) were signiﬁcantly increased in COVID-19 patients who\nsmoked. Moreover, smoking patients showed a worse survival compared with non-\nsmoking patients (Log Rank P = 0.045). After adjustment for age, gender and underlying\ndiseases, patients with smoking still had higher risk of mortality than that of non-smoking\npatients (hazard ratio[HR] 1.897, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]1.058–3.402, P = 0.032).\nConclusion: Smoking was thought to be a risk factor in predicting the prognosis of\nCOVID-19 and smoking patients might have a higher risk of mortality than that of the\nnon-smoking patients.\nKeywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cigarette, smoking, ACE2, inﬂammation, prognosis\nINTRODUCTION\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus\n2 (SARS-CoV-2) was ﬁrstly reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has already become an\nevolution of pandemic (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). The World Health Organization has declared\nit as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n1\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 634842\nPeng et al.\nSmoking Correlated With COVID-19\nfamily of RNA virus as SARS and Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome (Zhou et al., 2020) and has a higher risk of human-\nto-human transmission (Chan et al., 2020). Until now, more\nthan sixty-one million cases of COVID-19 as well as 1440000\ndeaths have been identiﬁed across the world (World Health\nOrganization, 2020).\nSmoking history is deﬁned as a history of continuous or\ncumulative smoking at least 6 months during the whole life\n(World Health Organisation, 1997), and cigarette smoking\nis quite prevalent all over the world. It kills approximately\n50% of users and 8 million people are died from it every\nyear, 1.2 million of which are exposed to the second-hand\nsmoking (Lippi et al., 2020). The mechanisms of smoking in\ninducing the occurrence of respiratory diseases are altering\nairway architecture, enhancing mucosal permeability, disrupting\nrespiratory epithelium and inhibiting ciliary clearance (Arcavi\nand Benowitz, 2004). It was reported that smoking played\nan important role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) in developed countries which was the fourth leading\ncause of death (Agarwal et al., 2020), and smokers were\nalso more likely to have increased incidence of cancer,\ninﬂuenza, tuberculosis and pneumonia relative to non-smokers\n(Warren et al., 2014; Brake et al., 2020). However, the\nrelationship of smoking and COVID-19 remains controversial.\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the role of\nsmoking in COVID-19.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis case series was subjected to the approval by the institutional\nethics board of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central\nSouth University (No. 2020001). The objects of study were\nlaboratory-conﬁrmed adult COVID-19 patients using real-time\npolymerase chain reaction who were admitted to the Public\nHealth Treatment Center of Changsha and Tongji Medical\nCollege of Huazhong University of Science and Technology,\nChina, by March 26th 2020. The patients older than 18 years\nwere included in the study and were divided into two groups\naccording to the survival and smoking statuses, including\nsurvivors and non-survivors, as well as the smokers and\nnon-smokers.\nData Collection\nTwo members of our team carefully collected and reviewed the\nmedical records of enrolled patients individually. The detailed\ninformation of those patients were recorded, including the\ndemographic data, underlying diseases, symptoms throughout\nthe course of the disease, blood test parameters, and results of\nchest computed tomography (CT) scans. The date of disease\nonset was deﬁned as the day when the symptoms were noticed.\nDeﬁnition and Study Endpoints\nAccording to the criteria of severe cases of COVID-19\n(National health commission and National administration\nof traditional Chinese medicine, 2020), the following criteria\nTABLE 1 | Demographics and baseline characteristics of survivor and\nnon-survivor of COVID-19 patients.\nNo. (%) Total\n(n = 622)\nSurvivor\n(n = 547)\nNon-survivor\n(n = 75)\nP value\nAge,%\n<0.001\n≥65 year\n212 (34.1)\n161 (29.4)\n51 (68.0)\n45 ≤age < 65\n231 (37.1)\n207 (37.8)\n24 (32.0)\n<45 year\n179 (28.8)\n179 (32.8)\n0 (0.0)\nGender,%\n0.011\nMale\n318 (51.1)\n269 (49.2)\n49 (65.3)\nFemale\n304 (48.9)\n278 (50.8)\n26 (34.7)\nSymptoms\nFever,%\n489 (78.6)\n426 (77.9)\n63 (84.0)\n0.226\nCough,%\n475 (76.4)\n416 (76.1)\n59 (78.7)\n0.617\nMyalgia,%\n99 (15.9)\n83 (15.2)\n16 (21.3)\n0.158\nFatigue,%\n241 (38.7)\n204 (37.3)\n37 (49.3)\n0.044\nHeadache,%\n82 (13.2)\n70 (12.8)\n12 (16.0)\n0.447\nDiarrhea,%\n149 (24.0)\n130 (23.8)\n19 (25.3)\n0.766\nAbdominal pain,%\n32 (5.1)\n26 (4.8)\n6 (8.0)\n0.224\nShortness of\nbreath,%\n196 (31.5)\n166 (30.3)\n30 (40.0)\n0.077\nChest CT with\nground glass\nchange,%\n370 (59.5)\n351 (64.2)\n19 (25.3)\n<0.001\nComorbidities\nHypertension,%\n176 (28.3)\n147 (26.9)\n29 (38.7)\n0.034\nCardiovascular\ndisease,%\n51 (8.2)\n36 (6.6)\n15 (2.0)\n<0.001\nDiabetes,%\n104 (16.7)\n86 (15.7)\n18 (24.0)\n0.072\nCOPD,%\n6 (1.0)\n4 (0.7)\n2 (2.7)\n0.108\nChronic\nbronchitis,%\n29 (4.7)\n26 (4.8)\n3 (4.0)\n0.297\nCerebrovascular\ndisease,%\n25 (4.0)\n20 (3.7)\n5 (6.7)\n0.061\nCancer,%\n21 (3.4)\n14 (2.6)\n7 (9.3)\n0.002\nSmoking,%\n62 (12.1)\n48 (8.7)\n14 (18.7)\n0.007\nCOVID-19,\nCoronavirus\ndisease\n19;\nCT,\ncomputed\ntomography;\nCOPD,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Finally, the risk of mortality was estimated\nusing Cox regression model with adjustment for the gender, age,\nand underlying diseases. All analyses were carried out by using\nIBM SPSS version 26 software.\nRESULTS\nBaseline\ncharacteristics\nof\nthe\nincluded\npatients\ngrouped\naccording to the survival status(survivors and non-survivors)\nwere summarized in Table 1. A total of 622 adult patients\nwith laboratory-conﬁrmed COVID-19 were included in our\nstudy, including 547 survivors and 75 non-survivors. Patients\nof non-survivors were further classiﬁed into three groups based\non ages, i.e., ≥65 years (68%), 45 years ≤age < 65 years\n(32%), <45 years (0%), respectively. Males who smoked\ncigarettes were found to have a higher rate of mortality\nthan females (65.3% vs. 34.7%, P = 0.011). In addition,\nstatistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence were shown in the symptoms\nof fatigue, ground glass changes indicated by chest CT,\ncomorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer),\nand smoking between non-survivors and survivors with COVID-\n19 (P < 0.05).\nWhite blood cells (10.5 vs. 5.2; P < 0.001), neutrophils (8.8\nvs. 3.3; P < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (29.0 vs. 20.0;\nP < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (43.0 vs. 24.9; P < 0.001),\ntotal bilirubin (13.8 vs. 10.0; P < 0.001), creatinine (88.0 vs.\n60.0; P < 0.001), creatine kinase (135.5 vs. 69.0; P < 0.001),\nD-Dimer (2.6 vs. 0.4; P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (88.0 vs.\n13.7; P < 0.001) were signiﬁcantly increased in COVID-19\npatients who died; However, lymphocytes (0.6 vs. 1.1; P < 0.001),\nplatelets (161.0 vs. 183.5; P < 0.001), albumin (30.8 vs. 37.3;\nP < 0.001), prothrombin time (11.6 vs. 13.0; P < 0.001), and\nactivated partial thromboplastin time (15.3 vs. 35.3; P < 0.001)\nwere signiﬁcantly decreased in survivors than that of non-\nsurvivors (Table 2).\nBaseline characteristics of the smoking and non-smoking\npatients\nwere\nsummarized\nin\nTable 3.\nThere\nwere\n560\nnon-smokers and 62 smokers. The ratios of smokers who\naged ≥65 years, 45 years ≤age < 65 years and <45 years\nwere 38.7%, 33.9%, 27.4%, respectively. The proportion of male\nsmokers was higher than that of female smokers (91.9% vs.\n8.1%, P < 0.001). Besides, there was statistical diﬀerence in the\nincidence of cerebrovascular disease between non-smoking and\nsmoking patients with COVID-19 (9.7% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.017).\nHowever, the severity of the patients and smoking were not\nstatistically related (40.8% vs. 59.2%, P = 0.105), to further\nconﬁrm the relationship, we did logistic regression and found\nthat smoking was not a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19\n(Supplementary Tables 1–4).\nWhite blood cells (6.3 vs. 5.4; P = 0.037), hemoglobin (139.0\nvs. 127.0; P < 0.001), creatinine (77.3 vs. 61.0; P < 0.001), and\nactivated partial thromboplastin time (37.4 vs. 35.4; P < 0.001)\nwere signiﬁcantly increased in COVID-19 patients who smoked,\nbut erythrocyte sedimentation rate (28.0 vs. 40.0; P = 0.016) was\nsigniﬁcantly decreased than that in non-smokers with COVID-\n19 (Table 4).\nMoreover, the association between smoking and survival\nwere analyzed by KM curve and Cox regression analysis\nin non-survivors after admission (Table 5 and Figure 1).\nSmoking patients showed a worse survival compared with non-\nsmoking patients (Log Rank P = 0.045). After adjusting for\nage, gender and underlying diseases, patients with smoking\nstill had higher risk of mortality than non-smoking patients\n(hazard ratio [HR] 1.897, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.058–\n3.402, P = 0.032).\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n3\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 634842\nPeng et al.\nSmoking Correlated With COVID-19\nTABLE 3 | Demographics and baseline characteristics of smoking and\nnon-smoking COVID-19 patients.\nNo. (%) Total\n(n = 622)\nNon-smokers\n(n = 560)\nSmokers\n(n = 62)\nP value\nAge, years\n0.209\n≥65 year\n212 (34.1)\n187 (33.4)\n25 (38.7)\n45 ≤age < 65\n231 (37.1)\n211 (37.7)\n20 (33.9)\n<45 year\n179 (28.8)\n162 (28.9)\n17 (27.4)\nGender\n<0.001\nMale\n318 (51.1)\n261 (46.6)\n57 (91.9)\nFemale\n304 (48.9)\n299 (53.4)\n5 (8.1)\nSymptoms\nFever,%\n489 (78.6)\n445 (79.5)\n44 (71.0)\n0.122\nCough,%\n475 (76.4)\n430 (76.8)\n45 (72.6)\n0.460\nMyalgia,%\n99 (15.9)\n87 (15.5)\n12 (19.4)\n0.440\nFatigue,%\n241 (38.7)\n215 (38.4)\n26 (41.9)\n0.583\nHeadache,%\n82 (13.2)\n78 (13.9)\n4 (6.5)\n0.098\nDiarrhea %\n149 (24.0)\n130 (23.2)\n19 (30.6)\n0.194\nAbdominal pain %\n32 (5.1)\n28 (5.0)\n4 (6.5)\n0.627\nShortness of breath\n%\n196 (31.5)\n179 (32.0)\n17 (27.4)\n0.460\nChest CT with\nground glass\nchange %\n370 (59.5)\n339 (60.5)\n31 (50.0)\n0.105\nComorbidities\nHypertension %\n176 (28.3)\n155 (27.6)\n21 (33.9)\n0.305\nCardiovascular\ndisease %\n51 (8.2)\n43 (7.7)\n8 (12.9)\n0.155\nDiabetes %\n104 (16.7)\n89 (15.8)\n15 (24.2)\n0.097\nCOPD %\n6 (1.0)\n6 (1.1)\n0 (0.0)\n0.413\nChronic bronchitis\n%\n29 (4.7)\n27 (4.8)\n2 (3.2)\n0.715\nCerebrovascular\ndisease %\n25 (4.0)\n19 (3.4)\n6 (9.7)\n0.017\nCancer %\n21 (3.4)\n18 (3.2)\n3 (4.8)\n0.502\nSeverity %\n0.105\nNon-severe\n254 (40.8)\n235 (42.0)\n19 (30.6)\nSevere\n368 (59.2)\n325 (58.0)\n43 (69.4)\nCOVID-19, Coronavirus disease 19; CT, computed tomography; COPD, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.

Besides, it is still controversial concerning the relationship\nbetween smoking and COVID-19. Some ﬁndings supported that\nsmoking patients with COVID-19 had greater severity of illness\n(Ahmed et al., 2020; Brake et al., 2020; Kaur et al., 2020; van\nZyl-Smit et al., 2020). However, others suggested that the risk of\ninfection was lower among smokers for the reason of nicotine\n(Tindle et al., 2020). Farsalinos et al. pointed out that nicotine\nmight have protective eﬀect against acute inﬂammatory lung\ninjury caused by cholinergic mediated COVID-19 (Panigrahi\net al., 2020). Lippi and Henry even claimed that active smoking\nhad no relationship with the severity of COVID-19 (Lippi and\nHenry, 2020). Subsequently, Silvano et al. argued that there were\nseveral mistakes in the study and concluded that smoking did\nplay a role in the severity of COVID-19 (Gallus et al., 2020). In\nthe present study, smoking was thought to have a statistically\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence in the prognosis of COVID-19, and smoking\npatients had higher risk of mortality than non-smokers.\nRobust evidences supported smoking to be a signiﬁcant risk\nfactor during the development of human diseases. Smoking is\nthought to play an important role in the progression of cancers\nand respiratory distress such as COPD and pulmonary ﬁbrosis\n(Hikichi et al., 2019). Smoking seriously aﬀects vascular system\nincluding fatal cardiovascular diseases and neurological diseases,\nabnormal brain development, ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s\ndiseases (West, 2017). Smoking can lead to lung injury and\nstructural changes thus develop minimal or no resistance to\nvirus attack (Arcavi and Benowitz, 2004), increase the patients’\nsusceptibility to viral and bacterial infections (Archie and\nCucullo, 2020). Besides, the vulnerability to inﬂuenza infection\nincreased to a ﬁve-hold enhancement in smokers when compared\nwith non-smokers (van Zyl-Smit et al., 2020).\nAs for prevention of COVID-19, owing to the requirements\nof social isolation and stay-at-home, the stress on potentially\nfatal condition, possibility of unemployment and feeling of\nconﬁnement could stimulate people’s desire to smoke (van Zyl-\nSmit et al., 2020). Smoking implies repeated exposure among\nﬁngers, cigarettes shafts and lips, which will in turn increase\nthe risk of COVID-19 transmission (Sherman, 1991; Sabino-\nSilva et al., 2020). Exhaled smoke, coughing or sneezing caused\nby tobacco smoking may produce aerosols containing SARS-\nCoV-2 which can survive for several hours to days in the\nsurroundings and contaminating surfaces. It has also reported\nthat secondhand smoke had the same damage caused by smoking\n(Moritsugu, 2007) which may suggest that passive smokers are\nequally possible to suﬀer from COVID-19 (Benjamin, 2011;\nMa et al., 2020). Furthermore, compared with non-smoking,\nsmoking, which can regulate both the immune and adaptive\nresponse, weakens the normal defective system of body (Qiu\net al., 2017). It was a strange phenomenon that the proportion\nwas extremely low among smokers of hospitalized COVID-19\npatients constituting only 6.5% in China and 1.3% in America\n(Cai, 2020; Lange et al., 2020). Similarly, our investigation\nsuggested that smokers comprised a proportion of 10% in all\nCOVID-19 hospital admissions. Scholars explained that part\nof older smokers progressed too fast to be sent to hospital\nfor treatment, and hence their death data were not captured\n(Appleby, 2020; Simons et al., 2020); Moreover, there was no\ndetailed information of patients if they were exposed to second-\nhand smoke (Silva et al., 2020).\nCoronaviruses have large type 1 transmembrane spike (S)\nglycoproteins, including two quite diﬀerent functional domains\nS1 and S2. To be speciﬁc, S1 contains binding site for\nangiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2005), while\nS2 promotes viral and host-cell membrane fusion which is\nnecessary for cellular inﬁltration (Coutard et al., 2020). S\nproteins can be enzymatically modiﬁed and then fusion sites\nrelated to cellular adhesion are exposed (Coutard et al., 2020),\nwhich play important roles in virus attack and transmission\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n4\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 634842\nPeng et al.\nSmoking Correlated With COVID-19\nTABLE 4 | Comparison of laboratory parameters between smoking and non-smoking COVID-19 patients.\nNormal range\nNon-smokers\nSmokers\nP-value\nWhite blood cells, × 109/L\n3.5-9.5\n5.4 (3.9-7.3)\n6.3 (4.5-8.3)\n0.037\nLymphocytes, × 109/L\n0.8-4.0\n1.0 (0.7-1.5)\n1.0 (0.6-1.7)\n0.703\nNeutrophils, × 109/L\n1.8-6.3\n3.5 (2.4-5.5)\n3.8 (2.8-6.7)\n0.163\nHemoglobin, g/L\n115-150\n127.0 (116.0-138.0)\n139.0 (124.5-149.3)\n<0.001\nPlatelets, × 109/L\n125-350\n181.0 (138.0-246.0)\n183.0 (136.0-248.8)\n0.616\nALT, U/L\n7-40\n20.7 (14.6-32.0)\n21.9 (14.9-33.5)\n0.738\nAST, U/L\n13-35\n25.3 (19.5-36.0)\n24.7 (19.0-37.3)\n0.642\nTotal bilirubin, µmol/L\n3.4-17.1\n10.2 (7.7-15.3)\n11.9 (8.0-16.4)\n0.249\nAlbumin, mg/L\n40-55\n36.5 (32.9-40.2)\n35.9 (31.5-41.5)\n0.833\nCreatinine, µmol/L\n44-133\n61.0 (49.0-77.0)\n77.3 (61.8-92.3)\n<0.001\nCK, U/L\n40-200\n71.2 (46.3-132.0)\n82.6 (46.5-191.4)\n0.332\nCK-MB, U/L\n0-24\n8.2 (2.2-13.0)\n6.4 (1.0-12.9)\n0.188\nPT, sec\n10-14\n13.2 (11.9-14.3)\n13.8 (11.9-14.5)\n0.083\nAPTT, sec\n28-45\n35.4 (31.5-40.3)\n37.4 (33.4-44.2)\n0.010\nD-dimer, µg/L\n0-0.55\n0.5 (0.2-1.3)\n0.4 (0.2-1.3)\n0.769\nESR, mm/h\n0-20\n40.0 (20.0-66.0)\n28.0 (9.5-56.0)\n0.016\nCRP, mg/L\n0-8\n20.0 (4.2-57.9)\n7.8 (2.6-58.2)\n0.052\nCOVID-19, Coronavirus disease 19;ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CK, creatine kinase; CK-MB, creatine kinase-MB; PT, prothrombin\ntime; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP, C-reactive protein. P values indicate differences between smoking and\nnon-smoking COVID-19 patients. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistically signiﬁcant values are indicated in Bold.\n(Archie and Cucullo, 2020). ACE2 receptors have been veriﬁed\nto be the site of access for the SARS-CoV2 virus entry.\nA signiﬁcantly higher aﬃnity was observed between modiﬁed\nS protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, almost 10 to 20 folds\ncompared with S protein of the previous SARS-CoV (Di Filippo\net al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020), which might explain the high\nsusceptibility of human-to-human transmission in the spread of\nCOVID-19. It was reported that ACE2 was upregulated in the\nresected lung tissue of smokers, but no ACE2 was found in non-\nsmokers, and smokers were more likely to have a signiﬁcant\nelevation of ACE2 in respiratory epithelial cells (Brake et al., 2020;\nLeung et al., 2020). In addition, cumulative cigarette smoke was\nassociated strongly with human ACE2 expression, and subjects\nwith the longest pack-years of smoking had the highest ACE2\nlevels (Smith et al., 2020) indicating that the older were more\nvulnerable and easier to have poor outcomes. Besides, ACE2 also\nwas thought to have higher expression in germ cells of males\nwhen compared with females (Sama et al., 2020), and smoking\nmales accounted for nearly 50% in rural areas of China while\napproximately 44.8% overall (Zhi et al., 2019), suggesting possibly\nthat males were more prone than females to be at the risk of\nCOVID-19, which were consistent with our study.\nLung macrophages contribute importantly to the development\nand resolution of human lung inﬂammation. Macrophages\ncan exert anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects, downregulate acquired\nimmune\nresponses\nand\nsuppress\ninﬂammation\nresponse\nunder normal physiological conditions. Nevertheless, when\nencountering the attack of pathogenic fungi, bacteria or\nviruses,\nmacrophages\ndiﬀerentiate\ninto\npro-inﬂammatory\nphenotype, release a large number of inﬂammatory cytokines\nand recruit other types of inﬂammatory cells to the sites of\ninﬂammation simultaneously (Hussell and Bell, 2014; Joshi\net al., 2018; Hu and Christman, 2019). It was reported that\nTABLE 5 | Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for the mortality of\nCOVID-19 patients.\nUnivariate\nMultivariate\nVariables\nLog Rank\nP value\nHR\n95% CI\nP value\nAge\n<0.001\n0.344\n0.227-0.523\n<0.001\nGender\n0.025\n/\n/\n0.140\nCardiovascular\ndisease\n<0.001\n/\n/\n0.073\nCOPD\n0.021\n6.796\n1.596-28.947\n0.010\nCerebrovascular\ndisease\n0.048\n/\n/\n0.277\nSmoking\n0.045\n1.897\n1.058-3.402\n0.032\nCOVID-19, Coronavirus disease 19; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease; HR, hazard ratios; P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.\nalveolar cavities were ﬁlled with amounts of macrophages,\nwhich could express ACE2 receptors and recognize SARS-\nCoV-2 viruses, resulting in cytokine storm (Kloc et al.,\n2020). Signiﬁcantly, cytokine storm signiﬁes the failure of\nrestoring homeostasis due to inﬂammatory response and\nhas become a well-established phenomenon in the viral and\nbacterial infections. It may lead to acute lung injury and\nfurther\ndevelop\ninto\nacute\nrespiratory\ndistress\nsyndrome\n(Tisoncik et al., 2012).\nThe aforementioned interpretation supports the importance\nof ACE2in the process. While, serine protease TMPRSS2 also\nacts as a crucial role for S protein priming to promote the entry\nof SARS-CoV2 (Hoﬀmann et al., 2020b). It was observed that\nonly a small number of ACE2 + cells express TMPRSS2 by single\ncell RNA sequencing analyses, demonstrating that there were\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org\n5\nMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 634842\nPeng et al.\nSmoking Correlated With COVID-19\nFIGURE 1 | The time-dependent risk of death in COVID-19 patients who smoked using Kaplan-Meier curve. Smoking patients showed a worse survival compared\nwith those with non-smoking (Log Rank P = 0.045).\nother proteases exerted the same eﬀects (Sungnak et al., 2020).\nInteresting, through the stimulation of smoking, the level of\nCathepsin B was increased and the activity of furin (cleave the\nspike protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the S1/S2 site) was preserved,\nwhich raised the likelihood of COVID-19 infection (Hoﬀmann\net al., 2020a; Kaur et al., 2020).\nBesides, in the lung autopsy of COVID-19 patients, there\nwere an inﬁltration of neutrophil in pulmonary capillaries, along\nwith ﬁbrin deposition and neutrophil extravasation into the\nalveolar space, which indicated that the formation of Neutrophil\nExtracellular Traps might lead to organ damage and mortality\nof COVID-19 patients (Barnes et al., 2020). Evidence suggested\nthat smoking might exert impact on the formation of Neutrophil\nExtracellular Traps, neutrophil traﬃcking and mediating both\nhumoral and cell immune responses (Kaur et al., 2020),\nwhich was tightly associated with the acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome development or even death (Barnes et al., 2020).\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, smoking might play a signiﬁcant role in the\nprognosis of COVID-19, and smoking patients might have a\nhigher risk of mortality than the non-smokers.\nThis study has some limitations. Firstly, there was no\ninformation to determine whether non-smoking patients were\nin the environment of secondhand smoke before the onset of\nCOVID-19, which might show a presence of observation bias.\nSecondly, for the reason of the medical records which had\nno speciﬁc distinction if patients were former, active or never\nsmokers, so we couldn’t elaborate on the role of smoking status\nmore in detail. Finally, the small total sample size and the number\nof patients who smoked which might also aﬀect the current\nresults. If it’s possible, we would enlarge the sample size in the\nfuture to make the results more convincing.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in\nthe manuscript/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can\nbe directed to the corresponding author/s.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed\nand approved by Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South\nUniversity\n(No.2020001).\nWritten\ninformed\nconsent\nfor\nparticipation was not required for this study in accordance with\nthe national legislation and the institutional requirements.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nYZ and SW contributed to the study design, implementation, and\ncritical revision.

Smoking status appears to lead to a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. However, ﬁndings from the studies\nconducted on this topic have not been consistent, and further exploration is required. Methods. The objective of this umbrella\nreview was to examine the eﬀects of smoking on COVID-19 management and mortality. Online databases that included\nPubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using relevant keywords up to July 27, 2022. Articles were\nrestricted to the English language, and the PRISMA protocol was followed. Results. A total of 27 systematic reviews, published\nfrom 2020 to 2022, were included. Individual studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 8 to 186, with various\npopulation sizes. The consensus from the majority of systematic reviews was that COVID-19 smoker patients experience\ngreater disease severity, disease progression, hospitalization rate, hospital admission duration, mechanical ventilation, ICU\nadmission, and mortality rate. Conclusions. COVID-19 patients with a history of smoking (current and former) are vulnerable\nto adverse hospital outcomes and worse COVID-19 progression. Eﬀective preventive and supportive approaches are required\nto decrease the risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in patients with a history of smoking.\nHindawi\nJournal of Smoking Cessation\nVolume 2023, Article ID 7656135, 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7656135\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7656135 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n1. Introduction\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-\nCoV-2)—the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19)—ﬁrst emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China\n[1–4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a\nglobal COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 [5]. As of\nAugust 8th, 2022, COVID-19 has infected more than 581\nmillion people and caused more than 6.4 million deaths\nworldwide [6]. SARS-Cov-2 is mainly an aerosol-born dis-\nease and infects new cases through respiratory droplet inha-\nlation [7–9]. COVID-19 presents mostly with ﬂu-like\nsymptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, dry cough, fatigue,\nback pain, headache, anorexia, diarrhea, anosmia (loss of\nsmell sensation), and ageusia (loss of taste sensation) [10,\n11]. However, 4–41% of total cases can be asymptomatic\n[10, 11]. Severe COVID-19 can cause acute respiratory dis-\ntress syndrome (ARDS), which manifests with hypoxia, dys-\npnea, chest pain, altered consciousness, cyanosis, and\neventual death. It mainly occurs among older adults (i.e.,\n>65 years) and vulnerable populations including patients\nwith chronic kidney, liver, or lung disease, diabetes mellitus,\nobesity, HIV infection, and smoking history [12].\nSmokers are more predisposed to viral and bacterial pul-\nmonary infections including inﬂuenza, tuberculosis, and\nbacterial pneumonia [13–16]. In the ﬁrst months of the pan-\ndemic in 2020, it was reported that Chinese patients with\nsevere COVID-19 were mostly COPD patients or current\nsmokers [17]. In addition, one of the earliest systematic\nreviews concluded that smoking is negatively associated with\nCOVID-19 progression and prognosis [18]. Some studies\nhave reported higher expression of angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE-2), which is the main receptor of SARS-\nCoV-2, in the lower respiratory airways of current smokers\nand COPD patients compared to nonsmokers, and stated that\nsmoking and COPD could contribute to a higher COVID-19\nincidence and relatively poorer outcomes [19, 20]. Conversely,\nsome studies have reported lower levels of ACE-2 among\nsmokers compared to nonsmokers [21, 22], and one prelimi-\nnary meta-analysis of ﬁve studies in China stated smoking\nmay not be signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of\nsevere disease among COVID-19 patients [23].\nThere have been ﬁve other meta-analyses conducted\nwhere the ﬁndings support the hypothesis that COPD and\ncurrent smoking status contribute to worse progression\nand poor outcomes among COVID-19 patients [24–28].\nOne of the meta-analyses speciﬁcally stated that smoking\ncan have negative adverse impacts on disease severity and\nmortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with\nmore impact on nondiabetic younger patients [27]. In addi-\ntion, another meta-analysis speciﬁed that both current\nsmoking\nand\nprevious\nhistory\nof\nsmoking\nincrease\nCOVID-19 severity signiﬁcantly, while previous history of\nsmoking increases the mortality risk [28]. Now that almost\nthree years has passed since the ﬁrst report of SARS-CoV-\n2 in human population, and large sample-sized studies and\nmore reliable data are available, further investigation of\nCOVID-19 and smoking is warranted. The aim of this\nreview was to examine the associations between COVID-19\nand smoking status (current smoker or history of smoking),\nanswer the controversial paradoxes, and ﬁll the gaps in the\nliterature.\n2. Methods\nThe objective of this umbrella study was to explore the pre-\nvailing systematic review literature pertaining the associa-\ntions between COVID-19 and smoking status (being a\ncurrent smoker or having history of smoking) and eﬀects\nof smoking on COVID-19 management and mortality. In\norder to substantiate the results, the Preferred Reporting\nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\nchecklist was followed. Quality of studies was evaluated with\nthe NIH quality assessment tool.\n2.1. Data Sources. An extensive search of four online data-\nbases was performed which included PubMed, Scopus,\nEmbase, and Web of Science as data sources. Articles were\nrestricted to the English language, and the search was con-\nducted up to July 27, 2022. The following keywords and their\ncombinations were used during the search:\n(a) “COVID-19” OR “Novel coronavirus” OR “2019-\nnCoV” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “SARS- CoV2”\n[Title/Abstract]\n(b) “Smoking” [Title/Abstract]\n(c) “Systematic review” [Title/Abstract]\n(d) [A] AND [B] AND [C]\n2.2. Study Selection. In order to improve the study selection\nprocess, a two-step method was employed. The ﬁrst step\nconsisted of screening literature with regard to titles and\nabstracts. This was done by ﬁve researchers. The second step\nwas performed by another ﬁve researchers, involving screen-\ning of full texts that were potentially eligible. Articles that\nmet the inclusion criteria were advanced to the next step of\ndata extraction. Articles were included if they had a system-\natic review nature and were peer-reviewed report on smok-\ning and COVID-19. The exclusion criteria included studies\nlacking published data investigations, nonhuman research\nstudies, duplications, abstracts with deﬁcient full texts, edito-\nrial letters, conference abstracts, case series, and case reports.\n2.3. Data Extraction. Data of publications having met the eli-\ngibility criteria and passing the second step of selection pro-\ncess was meticulously extracted and gathered in Table 1. Five\nresearchers investigated the full texts and extracted these\nstudy requisites. Any duplicates were removed, and the\naccuracy of the extracted data was checked.\n2.4. Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment. Study quality and\nrisk of bias was assessed with the National Institute of\nHealth (NIH) Quality Assessment (QA) Tools for Case\nSeries Studies. Two independent reviewers rated the quality\nof the included studies. Table 2 shows the results of the study\nquality and risk of bias. The scoring strategy of this tool has\nbeen explained at the bottom of this table.\n2\nJournal of Smoking Cessation\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7656135 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 1: Characteristics of studied items in the included papers.\nFirst author\n(reference)\nCountry\nYear of\npublication\nType of study\nPopulation\nAge\nGender\nSmoking history\nAlghamdi, S.A.

Results\nThe database search yielded 113 potential studies (after\nduplicates removed), and following the screening, a total of\n27 articles met the eligibility criteria (Figure 1). The included\nsystematic reviews were published between 2020 and 2022.\nOne study included was designed as reviews of reviews [33].\nIncluded studies were from China, the USA, Spain, Greece,\nThailand, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, and other countries.\nChina (7 studies) and the USA (5 studies) were the countries\nmost represented. The 27 systematic reviews included a wide\nrange of studies (i.e., 8 to 186 studies) with diﬀerent popula-\ntions (from 17 to 1,304,587 patients among mentioned popula-\ntions). Males were the dominant population in 6 studies [29,\n32, 37, 48, 49].

These\nresults are shown in Table 3.\n4. Discussions\nAccording to the NIH’s LitCovid database, more than 291,000\narticles related to COVID-19 have been published to date,\nwhich shows the explosion of research in this ﬁeld. This\nincredible amount of research has increased the information\non diﬀerent aspects of the disease. However, knowledge is still\nlacking in some areas with further research required to better\nunderstand COVID-19 and its eﬀects. This umbrella review is\naimed at organizing and updating the existing body of litera-\nture on the eﬀects of smoking on COVID-19.\nThe overall ﬁndings support the hypothesis of increased\nseverity of disease in COVID-19 smoker patients. Speciﬁ-\ncally, smoking is linked to more advanced COVID-19 out-\ncomes, as manifested by the necessity for ICU admission,\nmechanical ventilation, and COVID-19-related death. Nev-\nertheless, only a few studies demonstrated no signiﬁcant link\nbetween smoking and COVID-19-related mortality [30] and\nmechanical ventilation [51]. Additionally, only one study\nfound no link between smoking and an increased risk of\ndeath from COVID-19 [27]. Notably, a study in England,\nthat investigated approximately 17 million patient docu-\nments, discovered that increased COVID-19-related mortal-\nity linked to smoking no longer remained signiﬁcant after\nadjustment for the presence of preexisting chronic pulmo-\nnary disease. This suggests that smoking-induced comorbid-\nities may be the cause of the overall death toll among\nCOVID-19 smoker patients [53]. The results emphasize\nthe need for further research elucidating the mechanisms\nby which smoking increases the incidence of unfavorable\noutcomes in COVID-19 patients.\nVarious potentially harmful compounds are present in\ntobacco products. Moreover, further chemicals are formed\nduring aerosolization as a result of combustion or heating.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that pulmonary epithe-\nlium and vascular endothelium are both damaged by harmful\ncompounds in cigarette smoke.

Cessation\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7656135 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhas been associated with COVID-19 infection. It is probably\nthe most reasonable explanation for the potential increased\nrisk of death among smokers. Infection by the host-virus bind-\ning to the ACE2 receptors is likely a critical stage in SARS-\nCoV-2 infection [57–59]. Smokers have signiﬁcantly higher\nlevels of pulmonary ACE2 gene expression compared to non-\nsmokers [60]. Tobacco use can cause oxidative stress and\ninﬂammation in the lungs, making smokers more susceptible\nto bacterial or viral diseases [58, 61]. Oxidative stress reduces\nepithelial permeability, which may have substantial conse-\nquences for smokers with COVID-19 disease [62, 63]. Like-\nwise, smoking leads to cardiovascular disease, chronic lung\nillness, diabetes, and other comorbidities that are related to\nworse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection [64].\nOn the contrary, there is evidence demonstrating that\nsmoking may exert positive eﬀects on COVID-19 disease\nseverity, mediated by nicotine [51]. It is important to keep\nin mind that speciﬁc cigarette ingredients, like nicotine,\nmay aﬀect ACE2 diﬀerently from entire cigarettes [65].\nThe underlying mechanism might be attributed to the evi-\ndence showing nicotine might decrease tumor necrosis fac-\ntor (TNF) expression in airway epithelial cells [66].\nMoreover, nicotine may act as an agonist of the cholinergic\nanti-inﬂammatory pathway, which regulates the immune\nresponse and inﬂammatory reaction [67, 68].\nFactors responsible for higher susceptibility of smokers\nto COVID-19 are brieﬂy discussed here to better understand\nthe mechanisms about how smoking can aﬀect the human\nbody:\n(i) Smoking causes signiﬁcant pathological changes\nincluding the mucosal epithelial barrier and an\nincrease in the permeability of epithelial cells, which\nmakes smokers more prone to be defeated against\nthe virus invasion [69]\n(ii) Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) is deﬁned\nas the principal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus to\nenter the host cell. ACE 2 expression is upregulated\nin the small airway epithelium of smokers, so the\nvirus tends to invade host cells more easily. This\nupregulated receptor expression is one of the negative\ninﬂuences of oxidative stress due to smoking [20]\n(iii) Smoking can reduce the function of the immune\nsystem by causing a reduction in the number of\nCD4 + T cell (also named T helper cell, which acti-\nvates macrophage or B cell), inhibiting the produc-\ntion\nof interleukin-22 (which\nmoderates\nlung\ninﬂammation) and also, by promoting the secretion\nof catecholamines (which will weaken the immune\nsystem) [70, 71]\n(iv) The most serious complication of COVID-19 dis-\nease is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\nas a result of the cytokine storm. In this situation,\nlarge amounts of proinﬂammatory cytokines and\nchemokines such as IP-10, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-\n2, IL-7, and GM-CSF are released and entail severe\nimmune system response which eventually causes\nlung inﬂammation and damage. In former smokers,\nthe expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and other proinﬂam-\nmatory factors are increased [72]\nAlthough most of the reviewed articles support the\nhypothesis that nicotine, the main component of cigarettes,\nincreases the odds of developing severe illness of COVID-19,\nit is unknown whether the harm is related to nicotine or other\ntoxic ingredients in cigarettes. Even some articles indicate that\nnicotine may have anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects. Nicotine has\nbeen found to prevent acute lung damage and restrain the\nexpression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which plays role\nin the inﬂammatory response [66]. Furthermore, nicotine is\nan agonist of the cholinergic anti-inﬂammatory pathway that\nmodulates immune and inﬂammatory reaction [51, 73].\nThere have been a few original research studies comparing\nformer and current smokers. The lung may heal when some-\none quits smoking, which may bias the ﬁndings if former\nsmokers are part of the exposed group since one study found\nthat the death rate among former smokers reduces with age\n[44, 45]. As a result, the frequency of smokers may have been\nunderestimated, and some former smokers may have been\nincorrectly classiﬁed as nonsmokers [51]. As a result, only a\nfew systematic reviews compared the features of these two\ngroups. Three studies found that current smokers had lower\nrisks of an adverse outcome than former smokers [31, 35,\n51]. This might be because former smokers are more likely\nto be older, smoked for a longer period than current smokers,\nor because they have concomitant conditions such as asthma\nor COPD as a result of smoking [51]. Another factor might\nbe that current smokers reported their status less than former\nsmokers. [50], although a study found that current smokers\nhad a greater likelihood of adverse outcomes than former\nsmokers and nonsmokers [47].\nOverall, compared with nonsmokers, smokers have\nhigher risks of severe forms of the disease and hospitaliza-\ntion, and mortality [18, 39, 74]. On the contrary, the severity\nof COVID-19 was not associated with current or former\nsmoking but with the comorbidities caused by smoking\n[75, 76]. In this study, the incidence of infection by SARS\nCoV-2 virus in smokers and nonsmokers cannot be evalu-\nated clearly due to the lack of data at this present time.\n5. Conclusion\nThere is strong evidence that smoking increases the risks of\ndisease severity/progression, hospitalization, and mortality\namong COVID-19 patients. Encouraging smokers to quit\nusing, early initiation of treatment after the onset of symp-\ntoms, timely vaccination, and promoting other preventive\nbehaviors by public health providers can control the possi-\nbility of these people getting the infection and a better prog-\nnosis. Vaccination of smokers should be done completely\namong the priority groups.\nData Availability\nThe authors stated that all information provided in this arti-\ncle could be shared.\n11\nJournal of Smoking Cessation\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7656135 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nAdditional Points\nImplications.

Random-­\neffects models were used to estimate summary relative \nrisks (SRRs) and 95% CIs. Certainty of evidence was \nassessed using the Cochrane methods and the Grading \nof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and \nEvaluations framework.\nResults  A total of 186 studies representing 210 447 \ndeaths among 1 304 587 patients with COVID-­19 were \nincluded in this analysis. The SRR for death in patients with \nCOVID-­19 was 1.54 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.64, I2=92%, n=145, \nlow certainty) for diabetes and 1.42 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.54, \nI2=90%, n=127, low certainty) for hypertension compared \nwith patients without each of these comorbidities. \nRegarding obesity, the SSR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.31 to \n1.61, I2=91%, n=54, high certainty) for patients with \nBMI ≥30 kg/m2 compared with those with BMI <30 kg/\nm2 and 1.12 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.17, I2=68%, n=25) per 5 \nkg/m2 increase in BMI. There was evidence of a J-­shaped \nnon-­linear dose–response relationship between BMI and \nmortality from COVID-­19, with the nadir of the curve at \na BMI of around 22–24, and a 1.5–2-­fold increase in \nCOVID-­19 mortality with extreme obesity (BMI of 40–45). \nThe SRR was 1.28 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.40, I2=74%, n=28, \nlow certainty) for ever, 1.29 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.62, I2=84%, \nn=19) for current and 1.25 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.42, I2=75%, \nn=14) for former smokers compared with never smokers. \nThe absolute risk of COVID-­19 death was increased by \n14%, 11%, 12% and 7% for diabetes, hypertension, \nobesity and smoking, respectively. The proportion of \ndeaths attributable to diabetes, hypertension, obesity and \nsmoking was 8%, 7%, 11% and 2%, respectively.\nConclusion  Our findings suggest that diabetes, \nhypertension, obesity and smoking were associated with \nhigher COVID-­19 mortality, contributing to nearly 30% of \nCOVID-­19 deaths.\nTrial registration number  CRD42020218115.\nINTRODUCTION\nCOVID-­19 is a viral infectious disease caused \nby SARS-­CoV-­2, which was first reported \nin Wuhan City, China, in December 2019.1 \nSARS-­CoV-­2 has since spread to all countries \nworldwide and COVID-­19 has been declared \na pandemic by the WHO.2 As of 24 August \n2021, over 212.3 million cases and 4.4 million \ndeaths have been reported globally since \nthe start of the pandemic.3 Age is the main \nrisk factor for poor outcome in people with \nCOVID-­19 infection,4 5 as it is correlated with \nmore comorbidities. About 70%–87% of \nCOVID-­19 deaths are among people aged 70 \nyears or older.6 7 Patients with comorbidities, \nincluding diabetes, cardiovascular disease, \nrespiratory disease, chronic kidney disease \nand others chronic diseases are at increased \nrisk of developing severe or critical COVID-­\n19,8 9 which may partly explain a greater \nmortality in hospital.10–14 Studies suggest that \nStrengths and limitations of this study\n►\n►We did a systematic review and meta-­analysis of \n186 observational studies (210 447 deaths among 1 \n304 587 patients with COVID-­19) to investigate the \nassociation between diabetes, hypertension, obesi-\nty and smoking and risk of death in patients with \nCOVID-­19 and to estimate the proportion of deaths \nattributable to these four conditions.\n►\n►We performed several subgroup analyses, and as-\nsessed certainty of evidence using the Cochrane \nmethods and the Grading of Recommendations, \nAssessment, Development and Evaluations frame-\nwork. A non-­linear dose–response relation between \nbody mass index and COVID-­19 mortality was also \nexplored.\n►\n►However, we did not investigate the association be-\ntween presence of two or more coexisting comor-\nbidities and risk of death in patients with COVID-­19.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . \nby guest\n \non April 1, 2025\n \nhttp://bmjopen.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from \n25 October 2021. \n10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052777 on \nBMJ Open: first published as \n2\nMahamat-­Saleh Y, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e052777. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052777\nOpen access\b\nabout 20%–51% of patients hospitalised with COVID-­19 \nhave at least one comorbidity.10 15\nPrevious meta-­analyses reported a higher mortality rate \nfrom COVID-­19 in patients with comorbidities.16–22 Ssen-\ntongo et al, based on 25 studies published from December \n2019 to 9 July 2020, suggested that diabetes and hyper-\ntension were respectively associated with a 1.48-­fold and \n1.82-­fold greater risk of COVID-­19 death compared with \nthose without these comorbidities.16 Based on studies \npublished during the same period, Luo et al reported \nsimilar results.17 Du et al found that patients with obesity \nhad a 2.68-­fold risk of dying from COVID-­19 compared \nwith non-­obese patients.18 Most of the published meta-­\nanalyses did not investigate the shape of the dose–response \nrelationship between body mass index (BMI) and risk of \ndeath in order to clarify whether the association is dose-­\ndependent or if there are threshold effects.20 23–25 In addi-\ntion, evidence suggests that smoking may increase risk \nof severe disease and death from COVID-­19.19 However, \nit is not clear whether such an increase in COVID-­19 \nmortality is different in current and past smokers since \nprevious meta-­analyses have not performed separate anal-\nyses.19 26 27\nHowever, since the publication of these meta-­analyses, \nseveral observational studies have been published on \ndiabetes, hypertension, obesity or smoking and risk of \ndeath in patients with COVID-­194 28–122 and the strength \nof the associations differed greatly between studies. More-\nover, the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes, \nhypertension, obesity or smoking habits has not been esti-\nmated. This last aspect may help adapting public health \nmeasures and vaccination strategies to populations at risk \nof severe COVID-­19.\nGiven the rapidly increasing death from COVID-­19 \nglobally, and since diabetes, hypertension, obesity and \ntobacco smoking represent the most important public \nhealth problems worldwide, which contributed to higher \nrisk of death globally; we thus conducted a systematic \nreview and meta-­analysis of published observational \nstudies to investigate the association between diabetes, \nhypertension, smoking and obesity and risk of death \nin patient with COVID-­19 and to clarify the strength of \nthese associations. We further estimated the proportion \nof deaths attributable to these conditions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nThe meta-­analysis was reported according to the Preferred \nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-­\nAnalyses statement123 and Meta-­Analysis of Observational \nStudies in Epidemiology.124 This study was registered \nand accepted in the International Prospective Register \nof PROSPERO in October 2020. PubMed (MEDLINE), \nCochrane library and Embase databases were searched \nto identify relevant articles published in English from \nDecember 2019 to 14 November 2020. The search terms \nthat we used are provided in online supplemental file. \nIn addition, we searched the reference lists of the rele-\nvant publications, reviews and meta-­analyses to identify \nadditional potentially relevant studies. We only included \nobservational studies (cohort studies and cross-­sectional) \nthat reported relative risk estimates (such as hazard ratios \n(HRs), relative risk (RR) or odds ratios (ORs)) with \nthe 95% CIs with or without adjustment for potential \nconfounders. The search was independently screened by \ntwo researchers (YM-­S and TF) and discrepancies were \nresolved by discussion with a third researcher (MER).\nData collection\nFrom each included publication, we extracted results and \nstudy characteristics which included first author’s last \nname, publication year, country where the research was \nconducted in, study design, study description or name, \nstudy period, sample size with number of deaths, exposure, \ncategories, risk estimate and 95% CIs, and adjustment \nfactors. Data were extracted by YM-­S and extractions were \nchecked for accuracy by TF. Discrepancies were resolved \nthrough discussion with a third researcher (MER).\nQuality assessment and risk of bias\nThe quality of individual studies was assessed inde-\npendently by two researchers (YM-­S and TF) using the \nCochrane risk of bias tool ROBINS-­I, which grades studies \non a scale from critical risk of bias to low risk of bias \nconsidering bias due to confounding, selection of study \nparticipants, exposure measurement, misclassification of \nexposure during follow-­up, missing data, measurement of \noutcomes and bias due to selection of reported results.125 \nFollowing the assessment of risk of bias, the body of \nevidence for each comorbidity and risk of death was rated \nindependently using the Grading of Recommendations, \nAssessment, Development and Evaluations approach.126 \nDiscrepancies were resolved through discussion with a \nthird researcher (DA).\nData analysis\nWe used random effects models that consider both \nwithin study and between-­study variation to calculate \nsummary RRs (SRRs) (95% CIs) of COVID-­19 mortality \nfor patients with diabetes compared with those without \ndiabetes, for patients with hypertension versus those \nwithout hypertension, for obese versus non-­obese and for \ncurrent, former and ever smoker compared with never \nsmokers. The natural logarithm of the RRs was weighted \nusing random effects weights.127 Statistical heterogeneity \nbetween studies was assessed by the Cochrane Q test and \nthe I2 statistic.128 We calculated the absolute risk differ-\nence (RD) from the baseline risk of mortality (BR) from \nDocherty et al,129 large cohort and relative risk (RR) using \nthe formula RD=BR×(RR−1).130\nWe further performed a dose–response analysis for the \nassociations between BMI and COVID-­19 mortality using \nthe method described by Greenland and Longnecker to \ncompute the linear trend from the natural logs of the RRs \nand CIs across categories of BMI.131 We calculated SRRs \nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . \nby guest\n \non April 1, 2025\n \nhttp://bmjopen.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from \n25 October 2021. \n10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052777 on \nBMJ Open: first published as \n3\nMahamat-­Saleh Y, et al.

This method required mean or median \nof BMI, RRs and 95% CIs for at least three categories. \nThe mean or median BMI level per category was used if \nprovided in the publication, and if not, the midpoint of \nthe upper and lower boundaries was estimated as a range \nin each category. When the highest and lowest catego-\nries were open-­ended, we used the width of the adjacent \ninterval to estimate the upper and lower boundaries for \nthe category. For studies that reported results separately \nfor young and adults, for current and former smoker, but \nnot overall, we pooled the results using a fixed-­effects \nmodel as reported by the Hamling procedure to obtain \nan overall estimate to be used in the meta-­analysis.132\nTo explore the potential non-­linear dose–response \nrelation between BMI and mortality among patients with \nCOVID-­19, we used fractional polynomial models.133 We \ndetermined the best fitting second order fractional poly-\nnomial regression model, defined as the one with the \nlowest deviance. Only studies which presented more than \ntwo categories of BMI were included in the non-­linear \nanalysis. Subgroup and meta-­regression analyses were \nconducted to investigate potential sources of heteroge-\nneity. Small-­study effects, such as publication bias, were \nvisually assessed by examining funnel plots for asymmetry, \nand with Egger’s test,134 and the results were considered \nto indicate potential small-­study bias when p values \nwere <0.10. We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding \none study at a time to clarify whether the results were \ndriven by one large study or a study with an extreme \nresult.\nWe finally calculated the population attributable frac-\ntion (PAF) of mortality among patients with COVID-­19 \ndue to diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking, \nworldwide using the following formula135:\n\t﻿‍\nPAF =\np ×(RR−1)\n[p ×(RR−1)+1]‍\b\nWhere RR was the relative risk, p was the prevalence \nof the exposure in patient with COVID-­19. The preva-\nlence of diabetes (11.5%), hypertension (22.9%), obesity \n(29%) and smoking (9%) were obtained from previous \nmeta-­analyses.136–138\nPatient and public involvement\nPatients or the public were not involved in any aspect of \nthe study design, conduct or in the development of the \nresearch question or outcome measures.\nRESULTS\nA total of 6007 records were identified in MEDLINE, \nCochrane library and in EMBASE (figure 1). A total of \n4665 publications were excluded after reading title and \nabstract or because of duplicates. Among 1342 full-­text \narticles retrieved, 994 were excluded as not meeting the \ninclusion criteria, leaving a total of 348 publications. \nOf these, 162 articles were not eligible because they \nlacked sufficient data,139 140 reported no risk estimate or \nirrelevant data,139 140 because they had identical popu-\nlations141–151 or were retracted.152 Finally, a total of 186 \nobservational studies were included in this meta-­analysis. \nOf the included studies, 58 were from Europe, 58 from \nNorth America, 60 from Asia, 6 from South America and \n4 from Africa (online supplemental table 1). From the \n186 publications assessed using the ROBINS-­I tool, 92 \nwere evaluated as being at low risk of bias, 49 at moderate \nrisk of bias, 21 at serious risk of bias and 24 at critical \nrisk of bias because of insufficient adjustment of relevant \nconfounders (online supplemental table 2).\nDiabetes and mortality in patient with COVID-19\nA total of 145 studies4 28–119 121 122 129 153–201 were included \nin the analysis of the association between diabetes and \nmortality, including a total of 198 491 deaths among 1 \n165 897 patients with COVID-­19. The SRR for diabetes \npatients compared with those without diabetes was 1.54 \n(95% CI 1.44 to 1.64) and there was high heteroge-\nneity among studies (I2=92%). We found that diabetes \nincreased the absolute risk of death by 14% (table 1). The \nfunnel plot did not provide evidence of publication bias \n(online supplemental figure 1) and we found no evidence \nof small study effects (Egger’s test, p value=0.54).\nThe \npositive \nassociation \npersisted \nacross \nall \nsubgroups analyses stratified by study design, number \nof patients, geographic location and adjustment for \nsome confounding factors (table  2). However, meta-­\nregression analyses suggested some indication of hetero-\ngeneity between studies that adjusted for multiple factors \nsuch as age, sex and other comorbidities versus studies \nwithout such adjustment or adjusted for age only (Pheteroge-\nneity=0.003), with a stronger association for the studies with \nno adjustment factors or those adjusted for age only.

We found that \npatients with diabetes had a 54% higher risk of death \nfrom COVID-­19 compared with patients without diabetes; \nthose with hypertension had a 42% increase in the rela-\ntive risk of death from COVID-­19 compared with patients \nwithout hypertension and those with obesity have a 45% \ngreater in the relative risk of COVID-­19 death compared \nwith non-­obese patients. In addition, we found that ever, \ncurrent and former smoking was associated with 28%, \n29% and 25% increases in the relative risk of death in \npatients with COVID-­19. Our linear dose–response meta-­\nanalysis suggested that each 5 kg/km2 increment in \nBMI was associated with a 12% greater risk of COVID-­19 \ndeath. However, evidence of non-­linearity was observed \nin the analysis of BMI and risk of COVID-­19 death, with \na J-­shaped dose–response relation with flattening of the \ndose–response curve between 22 and 24 of BMI level \nand a slight increase below that range and a 1.5–2-­fold \nincrease in risk with a BMI of 40–45. While there was \nno publication bias, study heterogeneity was high for all \nexposure and this persisted in most of the subgroup anal-\nyses. However, the heterogeneity appeared to be driven to \na larger extent by differences in the strength of the asso-\nciations, than differences in the direction of the effect, \nas the vast majority of studies reported significant or \nnon-­significant positive associations between these expo-\nsures and increased mortality, and relatively few studies \nreported risk estimates in the direction of an inverse asso-\nciation. Given this meta-­analysis included more studies \nthan a typical meta-­analysis, I2 and heterogeneity were \nhigh as the likelihood of divergent findings increases with \nincreasing number of studies.\nComparisons to findings from previous epidemiological \nstudies and biological mechanisms\nSince the first reports of COVID-­19, several studies have \nshown that patients with COVID-­19 with comorbidities \nhave a higher risk of death.4 17 244 245 However, these studies \nFigure 5  Association between ever smoking (vs never \nsmoking) and mortality risk in patients with COVID-­19.\nFigure 6  Association between current smoking (vs never \nsmoking) and mortality risk in patients with COVID-­19.\nFigure 7  Association between former smoking (vs never \nsmoking) and mortality risk in patients with COVID-­19.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . \nby guest\n \non April 1, 2025\n \nhttp://bmjopen.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from \n25 October 2021. \n10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052777 on \nBMJ Open: first published as \n8\nMahamat-­Saleh Y, et al.

Our findings are similar to results from previ-\nously published systematic reviews, suggesting a higher \nmortality rate of COVID-­19 in patients with cardiovascular \nor chronic condition.16 17 21 22 We found a 1.54-­fold greater \nmortality from COVID-­19 among patient with diabetes \ncompared with those without (n=145 studies), which \nis similar to those yielded in previous meta-­analyses,16 \nwhereas the estimate magnitude is weaker than those \nin de Almeida-­Pititto et al,21 Kumar et al,246 Shang et al248 \nand Luo et al.17 In our subgroup analyses, we found that \nthe positive association was stronger in studies without \nany adjustment or adjusted for age only compared \nwith studies that adjusted for multiple factors. Thus, \nthe higher magnitude observed in the previous meta-­\nanalyses may be in part due to the important number of \nstudies without adjustment for confounding factors such \nas age and comorbidities, which are mostly with critical \nor serious risk of bias. In addition, we estimated that \n8% of deaths by COVID-­19 were attributed to diabetes; \nthis aspect has to our knowledge not been investigated \npreviously. The absolute risk of death associated with \ndiabetes was increased by 14%. The mechanism under-\nlying the increased mortality from COVID-­19 in patients \nwith diabetes may be explained by chronic inflammatory \nconditions. Patients with COVID-­19 with diabetes have a \nsignificantly higher inflammatory markers such as C reac-\ntive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-­6) compared with \npatients without diabetes.249 Inflammatory markers such \nas IL-­6, CRP, IL-­10, lactate dehydrogenase and tumor \nnecrosis factor-α, which are indicative of different aspects \nof COVID-­19 severity, requirements of intensive care \nsupport including dialysis and ventilation, are associated \nwith higher risk of death.250 251\nRegarding hypertension, our findings yielded a 1.42-­\nfold higher risk of death from COVID-­19 in patient with \nhypertension (n=127 studies), which also is slightly weaker \nthan the results from previous meta-­analyses.16 22 247 \nNearly 7% of death in patients with COVID-­19 could be \nattributed to hypertension and we found that hyperten-\nsion increased the absolute risk of death by 11%. Previous \nclinical studies showed that hypertension is a major risk \nfactor for worse outcome in patients infected with SARS \nand Middle East respiratory syndrome.252 253 Although, \nthe exact mechanism by which hypertension increase \nmortality rate remains unclear, chronic inflammation \nmay play an active role in increasing risk of death.\nDu et al suggested that patients with obesity had a \n2.68-­fold risk for COVID-­19 mortality compared with \nnon-­obese patients (n=7 studies).18 In dose–response \nanalysis, they showed that for each 1 kg/m2 increase in \nBMI, the risk of death increased by 6%. Partly consis-\ntent with this study, we found that a 5 kg/m2 increase \nin BMI level was associated with a 12% increase in the \nrisk of death in patient with COVID-­19 (n=25 studies). \nIn addition, we found evidence of a non-­linear J-­shaped \nassociation between BMI and mortality from COVID-­19, \nwith a flattening of the dose–response curve for BMI \nvalues between 22 and 24 kg/m2 and with a slightly \nhigher risk below that range and a moderate to strong \nincrease in mortality with severe obesity (BMI 40–45). \nObesity is associated with a low-­grade systemic inflam-\nmation, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of \nrespiratory conditions. Patients with COVID-­19 and with \npreexisting obesity may have an overactivated inflam-\nmation response, which may induce excessive inflam-\nmatory response.254 Obesity is also strongly associated \nwith increased risk of diabetes, hypertension and several \nother chronic diseases255 that increases risk of COVID-­19 \nmortality.256\nIn addition, our finding showed that ever, current \nand former smoking was associated with 28%, 29% and \n25% increases in the relative risk of death in patients \nwith COVID-­19 compared with never smokers. Tobacco \nsmoking is known to alter the function of the immune \nsystem; therefore smokers are more likely to get a \nsevere infection of COVID-­19 due to their poor muco-\nciliary clearance, which could lead to the release of pro-­\ninflammatory markers and oxidative stress and thereby \ncontribute to higher mortality rates. The risk of death in \nformer smokers was higher than in never smokers and \nonly slightly lower than risk in current smoker. However, \nmore studies are required to clarify the impact of longer \ndurations of smoking cessation in former smokers on risk \nof death in patients with COVID-­19.\nAlthough we found that diabetes, hypertension, BMI \nand smoking were associated with greater COVID-­19 \nmortality, a recent meta-­analysis suggested that mortality \nwas more frequently observed in patients with COVID-­19 \nwith cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accident \nand chronic kidney disease.257 The authors observed that \nCOVID-­19 mortality among all comorbidities was high in \nEuropean and Latin American patients compared with \nthe US patients. It is possible that geographical differ-\nences in therapeutic practice of COVID-­19 such as the \nuse of antibiotics, antivirals and others drugs may partly \nexplain the greater COVID-­19 death in some regions,258 \nwhile there was no evidence of heterogeneity in findings \nacross geographic location in our study. The review also \nsuggested that COVID-­19 mortality among those with \nunderlying medical diseases was high in mostly elderly \npatients.258 However, we did not perform subgroup anal-\nysis by age because this information was lacking in most of \nthe included studies.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . \nby guest\n \non April 1, 2025\n \nhttp://bmjopen.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from \n25 October 2021. \n10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052777 on \nBMJ Open: first published as \n9\nMahamat-­Saleh Y, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e052777. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052777\nOpen access\nStrengths, limitations and public health implications\nThis present meta-­analysis of observational studies on \ndiabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking and risk of \ndeath in patients with COVID-­19 has several strengths, \nincluding the large sample size and number of COVID-­19 \ndeaths, the detailed subgroup and sensitivity analyses, \nas well as the linear and non-­linear dose–response anal-\nyses, which clarified the strength and shape of the dose–\nresponse relationship. Original aspects of our study \nincluded the estimation of the number of deaths attrib-\nutable to these conditions. This is, to our knowledge, the \nfirst meta-­analysis that perform a separate analysis of ever, \ncurrent and former smoking versus never smoking in rela-\ntion to COVID-­19 mortality. As any previous published \nmeta-­analyses, the current analysis has some limitations \nthat should be considered in the interpretation of our \nfindings. First, we did not investigate the association \nbetween presence of two or more coexisting comorbidi-\nties and risk of death in patients with COVID-­19. Finally, \nsubgroup analyses stratified by clinical or lifestyle factors \nsuch as medications, diabetes type and duration, adher-\nence to specific diet, or physical activity were not possible \nbecause of the lack of such data from the studies included.\nDespite these limitations, our findings may have \nimportant public health implications in the context of \nincreasing numbers of severe COVID-­19 cases, overbur-\ndened hospitals and leading to higher hospital death due \nto COVID-­19 and suggest that people with cardiovascular \nrisk factors, in particular those with diabetes, hyperten-\nsion and obesity, should be considered as a high priority to \nget vaccinated. In addition, since smoking is a risk factor \nfor several chronic diseases, including cancer and cardio-\nvascular disease, our finding lend support to the impor-\ntance of smoking prevention and smoking cessation and \nsupport policies and public health efforts to reduce the \nprevalence smoking in the general population.\nCONCLUSION\nOur finding suggests that presence of diabetes, hyperten-\nsion, obesity and smoking in patients with COVID-­19 is \nassociated with a 1.54-­fold, 1.42-­fold, 1.45-­fold and 1.28-­\nfold greater risk of mortality, respectively. We have found \nthat the proportion of death attributable to diabetes, \nhypertension, obesity and smoking was 8%, 7%, 11% and \n2%, respectively. These findings support that people with \ndiabetes, hypertension, obesity should be prioritised for \nvaccination in order to limit the higher death rates in \nhospital. Public policies should promote a healthier life-\nstyle including healthier diets and regular physical activity \nto reduce patient risk factors and comorbidities.\nAuthor affiliations\n1Paris-­Saclay University, UVSQ, Inserm, Gustave Roussy, \"Exposome and Heredity\" \nteam, CESP, F-­94805, Villejuif, France\n2Department of Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University \nof Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland\n3Laboratory of Soil Biodiversity, Faculty of Science, University of Neuchatel, \nNeuchâtel, Switzerland\n4Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, Paris, France\n5National Institute for Health Research, Health Protection Research Unit in \nHealthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance, Imperial College \nLondon, London, UK\n6Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department, Bichat-­Claude Bernard Hospital, \nAP-­HP, Paris, France\n7Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial \nCollege London, London, UK\n8Department of Nutrition, Bjørknes University College, Oslo, Norway\n9Department of Endocrinology, Morbid Obesity and Preventive Medicine, Oslo \nUniversity Hospital, Oslo, Norway\n10Unit of Cardiovascular and Nutritional Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental \nMedicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n11Department of Statistics, Computer Science and Applications “G.

Smoking is an \nestablished risk factor respiratory infections.1 Media \nreports and opinion pieces have made reasonable \nsuggestions that smoking may be detrimental in \ncase of infection with SARS-CoV-2, assuming that \nCurrent smoking, former smoking, and \nadverse outcome among hospitalized \nCOVID-19 patients: a systematic review  \nand meta-analysis\nKonstantinos Farsalinos\n, Anastasia Barbouni, Konstantinos Poulas, Riccardo Polosa\n, \nPasquale Caponnetto and Raymond Niaura \nAbstract\nBackground: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and effects of current \nsmoking on adverse outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nMethods: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) identified 18 (from a total of 1398) \nrelevant studies. Pooled current smoking prevalence was compared with the gender-\nadjusted and gender and age-adjusted, population-based expected prevalence by calculating \nprevalence odds ratio (POR). The association between current, compared with non-current \nand former, smoking and adverse outcome was examined. A secondary analysis was \nperformed by including 12 pre-publications (30 studies in total). All analyses were performed \nusing random-effects meta-analysis.\nResults: Among 6515 patients, the pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.8% [95% \nconfidence interval (CI): 4.8–9.1%]. The gender-adjusted POR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.16–0.25, \np < 0.001), and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19–0.30, p < 0.001). \nCurrent smokers were more likely to have an adverse outcome compared with non-current \nsmokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06–2.20, p = 0.022] but less likely compared with \nformer smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27–0.74, p = 0.003). When pre-publications were added \n(n = 10,631), the gender-adjusted POR was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19–0.38, p < 0.001) and the gender \nand age-adjusted POR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24–0.48, p < 0.001).\nConclusion: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational case series found an \nunexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. \nHospitalized current smokers had higher odds compared with non-current smokers but \nlower odds compared with former smokers for an adverse outcome. Smoking cannot be \nconsidered a protective measure for COVID-19. However, the hypothesis that nicotine may \nhave a protective effect in COVID-19 that is partially masked by smoking-related toxicity and \nby the abrupt cessation of nicotine intake when smokers are hospitalized should be explored \nin laboratory studies and clinical trials using pharmaceutical nicotine products.\nKeywords:  adverse outcome, COVID-19, hospitalization, inflammation, nicotine, SARS-CoV-2, \nsmoking\nReceived: 7 May 2020; revised manuscript accepted: 28 May 2020.\nCorrespondence to: \nKonstantinos Farsalinos \nDepartment of Pharmacy, \nLaboratory of Molecular \nBiology and Immunology, \nUniversity of Patras, \nPanepistimiopolis, 26500, \nGreece\nDepartment of Public and \nCommunity Health, School \nof Public Health, University \nof West Attica, Egaleo, \nAttica, Greece \nkfarsalinos@gmail.com\nAnastasia Barbouni \nDepartment of Public and \nCommunity Health, School \nof Public Health, University \nof West Attica, Egaleo, \nAttica, Greece\nKonstantinos Poulas \nDepartment of Pharmacy, \nLaboratory of Mol. \nBiology and Immunology, \nUniversity of Patras, \nPanepistimiopolis, Greece\nRiccardo Polosa \nCenter of Excellence for \nthe Acceleration of Harm \nReduction, University of \nCatania, Catania, Italy\nDepartment of Clinical and \nExperimental Medicine, \nUniversity of Catania, \nCatania, Italy\nPasquale Caponnetto \nCenter of Excellence for \nthe Acceleration of Harm \nReduction, University of \nCatania, Catania, Italy\nRaymond Niaura \nDepartments of Social \nand Behavioral Science \nand Epidemiology, College \nof Global Public Health, \nNew York University, New \nYork, USA\n935765 TAJ0010.1177/2040622320935765Therapeutic Advances in Chronic DiseaseK Farsalinos, A Barbouni\nreview-article20202020\nSystematic Review\nTherapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease 11\n2\t\njournals.sagepub.com/home/taj\nthe gender differences in COVID-19 vulnerability \nand mortality may be due to the increased preva-\nlence of smoking among Chinese men compared \nwith women.2,3 However, until recently, clinical \ndata were lacking. A study of 78 COVID-19 \npatients found that history of smoking increased \nthe risk for disease progression by more than \n14-fold.4 However, the association was weak and \nwith a wide 95% confidence interval (CI) since \nonly five smoking patients were included, of whom \nthree progressed to severe disease. A meta-analysis \nof five case series from China found that current \nsmokers had a statistically insignificant increase in \nthe odds of progressing to severe COVID-19.5 \nHowever, another systematic review reported that \nsmokers were more likely to be admitted to an \nintensive care unit (ICU), need mechanical ventila-\ntion, or die compared with non-smokers.6\nSmoking is an established risk factor for a variety of \ndiseases, including cardiovascular disease and \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), \nwhich appear to be risk factors for severe COVID-\n19 and adverse outcome.7 Thus, it would be \nexpected for smokers to be over-represented among \nCOVID-19 patients. Still, in a recent meta-analysis \nof 13 studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in \nChina, an unexpectedly low prevalence of smoking, \napproximately one-fourth the population smoking \nprevalence, was found.8 To further explore this \nissue, we performed a systematic review of case \nseries presenting data on the smoking status of hos-\npitalized COVID-19 patients in order to:\n1.\t Calculate the pooled prevalence of smoking \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients \nand compare it with the expected preva-\nlence based on population smoking rates.\n2.\t Examine the association between current, \ncompared with non-current and former, \nsmoking \nand \nadverse \noutcome \nin \nCOVID-19.\nMethods\nStudies included\nA systematic search of the literature (PubMed) \nwas performed for studies published until 25 \nApril 2020 using the terms “(SARS-CoV-2 OR \nCOVID-19 OR 2019-nCoV) AND (Clinical OR \nMortality OR Outcome)” in the title or the \nabstract. Studies were included in the analysis if \nthey satisfied all of the following criteria:\n1.\t Present hospitalized patients with COVID-19\n2.\t Classify patients according to disease sever-\nity, irrespective of the severity definition\n3.\t Present data on the smoking status, sepa-\nrately for each severity classification.\nOut of a total of 1398 studies, 19 studies fulfilling \nthe previously mentioned criteria were found.4,9–\n26 One study was excluded because of unreliable \ndata since the sum of current and former smok-\ners did not correspond to the numbers presented \nin different severity subgroups.26 Thus, 18 stud-\nies were analyzed. All of the studies were retro-\nspective observational case series. The PRISMA \nflow diagram is presented in the Supplemental \nFigure S1. Most of the studies were from China \n(n = 15), while two studies presented patients \nfrom the United States (US) and one from South \nKorea. Four of the studies recorded separately \ncurrent and former smokers and were used to \nexamine the association between current, rather \nthan \nformer, \nsmoking \nand \nadverse \nout-\ncome.9,13,20,21 The rest of the studies reported the \nsmoking status as “smoking” or “history of smok-\ning” and may have included former smokers. \nThree studies had missing smoking data on 14 of \n1099, 44 of 645, and 22 of 476 patients.9,16,23 \nThe number of patients with available smoking \ndata (1085, 601 and 454, respectively) were used \nin the calculations. Another study reported \nunknown smoking history for 13 out of 487 \npatients (all with mild disease)17; they were also \nexcluded from the analysis. \nIn addition, we sought to identify pre-publica-\ntions (not peer-reviewed) on the pre-print server \nMedrxiv. The terms “smoking” and “COVID-\n19” were sought in the title or abstract. A total of \n123 pre-publications were found, with 12 fulfill-\ning the previously mentioned criteria.27–38 All of \nthe studies were retrospective observational case \nseries. Of these, nine were from China, two from \nthe US, and one from Japan. Two of the studies \nrecorded current and former smokers sepa-\nrately.27,31 The rest of the studies reported smok-\ning status as “smoking” or “history of smoking” \nand may have included former smokers. One \nstudy from the US reported never smokers or \nunknown history of smoking as one group, with-\nout clarifying how many patients had missing \ndata.27 Another study reported the smoking sta-\ntus and outcomes for 170 of 200 patients.29 In \ntotal, 30 studies (published and pre-publications) \nwere used in the secondary analysis, whereas 6 \nK Farsalinos, A Barbouni et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/taj\t\n3\nstudies were used to examine the association \nbetween current versus former smoking and \nadverse outcome.\nAnalysis\nA cross-sectional analysis was performed. In two \nstudies, both outpatients and hospitalized patients \nwere presented.20,27 In one of them, 7162 patients \nwere presented in total, of whom 5143 were \nambulatory, 1037 were hospitalized in non-ICU \nunits, 457 were hospitalized in ICU units, and for \n525 patients the hospitalization status was \nunknown.20 Only hospitalized patients (n = 1494) \nwere included to the analysis. In the other study, \n2104 patients were ambulatory and 1999 were \nhospitalized.27 Of those hospitalized, 1582 were \nincluded in the analysis since 932 were classified \nas “discharged with no critical illness” and 650 as \nhaving “critical illness.” In studies where former \nsmokers were not separately presented, all \npatients with a positive smoking history were clas-\nsified as current smokers. When presented sepa-\nrately, former smokers were included in the \nnon-current smoking group.\nThe pooled prevalence of current smoking was \ncalculated using random-effects meta-analysis. \nSmoking prevalence in each study was compared \nwith the expected prevalence based on gender-\nspecific population smoking rates. The expected \nprevalence of smoking in each study was calcu-\nlated using the gender distribution of patients in \neach study and the gender-specific population \nsmoking prevalence. The following formula was \nused:\nSP\nP x SP\nP x SP\nE\nM\nP M\nF\nP F\n=\n+\n−\n−\n(\n)\n(\n)\n \n \nwhere \nSPE = expected \nsmoking \nprevalence; \nPM = male prevalence among patients; SPP–M =  \npopulation \nsmoking \nprevalence \nin \nmales; \nPF = female prevalence among patients; and  \nSPP–F = population smoking prevalence in females.\nThe observed smoking prevalence was compared \nwith the expected smoking prevalence by calcu-\nlating prevalence odds ratio (POR).39 The popu-\nlation smoking rates used to calculate the \ngender-adjusted expected number of smokers in \neach study were (males and females, respectively): \n50.5% and 2.1% for China,40 15.6% and 12.0% \nin the US,41 35.8% and 6.5% in South Korea,42 \nand 29.3% and 7.2% in Japan.43\nThe studies analyzed did not include data on the \npatients’ age distribution. Therefore, age-adjust-\nment in the expected smoking prevalence calcula-\ntion was performed by assuming that all patients \nwere ⩾65 years old. This represents a worst-case \nscenario considering that people aged ⩾65 years \nhave the lowest smoking rates compared with other \nadult age groups while the mean or median age of \nhospitalized COVID-19 patients was by far lower \nthan 65 years in the studies examined (Table 1). \nThus, this approach underestimates the expected \nsmoking prevalence. The population smoking \nrates used to calculate the age and gender-adjusted \nexpected number of smokers in each study were \n(males and females, respectively): 44.0% and 4.1% \nfor China,40 10.1% and 7.7% in the US,44 17.9% \nand 1.9% in South Korea,45 and 21.2% and 5.4% \nin Japan.46,47 The formula mentioned previously \nwas applied to calculate the gender and age-\nadjusted expected smoking prevalence. We report \nboth gender-adjusted and gender and age-adjusted \nPOR. The association between current (versus \nnon-current) smoking and adverse outcome was \nperformed by calculating the odds ratio (OR). In \naddition, the association between current smoking \n(versus former smoking) and adverse outcome was \ncalculated using the studies that presented data for \nformer smokers separately; never smokers were \nexcluded from the latter analysis. All analyses were \nperformed with random-effects meta-analyses \nusing MetaXL v5.3, with heterogeneity evaluated \nthrough I2 and publication bias examined by visual \nassessment of funnel plots.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nThe characteristics of the studies included in this \nanalysis are presented in Table 1. Published stud-\nies included 6515 hospitalized patients, of whom \n440 were current smokers. Together with the pre-\npublications, 10,631 patients, with 961 of them \nbeing smokers, were examined. Adverse out-\ncomes ranged from non-specific “severe” to spe-\ncific definitions based on clinical criteria or death. \nNo publication bias was obvious from the funnel \nplot.

Compared with for-\nmer smokers, current smokers were less likely to \nexperience an adverse outcome (OR: 0.61, 95% \nCI: 0.36–1.02, p = 0.056) with moderate hetero-\ngeneity being observed (I2 = 54%, Supplemental \nFigure S5).\nDiscussion\nThe main finding of this systematic review was \nthe unusually low prevalence of current smoking \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Smoking \nprevalence was less than one-fourth the expected \nprevalence based on gender-adjusted population \nsmoking rates. Even when age-adjustment was \nperformed by calculating expected prevalence \nbased on the age group with the lowest popula-\ntion smoking rates (age ⩾ 65 years), smoking \nprevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients \nwas still approximately one-third the expected \nprevalence (66% lower). Current smokers had \nhigher odds for adverse outcome compared with \nnon-current smokers. In contrast, current smok-\ners were less likely to have an adverse outcome \ncompared with former smokers.\nAn important limitation is that the analysis was \nunadjusted for confounding factors such as comor-\nbidities that appear to be associated with higher \nrisk for an adverse outcome in COVID-19.48 \nSociodemographic factors may also be associated \nwith reduced access of smokers to hospital care. \nOlder age is usually associated with lower current \nsmoking and higher former smoking prevalence, \nwhich could explain the lower odds for adverse \noutcome in current compared with former smok-\ners. However, China has a high smoking \nprevalence even in older age groups. Liu et  al. \nreported a prevalence of >50% in smoking males \naged 60–69 years and >40% in those >70 years.40,49 \nMoreover, we performed age-adjustment by calcu-\nlating the expected prevalence based on the adult \nage group with the lowest population smoking \nprevalence. Still, the difference between observed \nand expected smoking prevalence was substantial. \nThere were no available data to further adjust \nexpected prevalence based on geographically-\nspecific population smoking rates. The possibility \nfor inaccurate recording, false-reporting, or inabil-\nity to report the smoking status due to critical con-\ndition of patients admitted to the hospitals, as well \nas the lack of an objective assessment of the smok-\ning status, should also be considered. Still, the \nfindings that smokers are under-represented by \napproximately 3- to >4-fold compared with popu-\nlation smoking rates could be explained only by \nunusually extensive under-reporting of the current \nsmoking status. Finally, many studies reported \nsmoking history instead of current smoking, which \nmight include former smokers and thus overesti-\nmate current smoking prevalence among hospital-\nized COVID-19 patients.\nLow prevalence of current smokers among hospi-\ntalized COVID-19 patients has been observed in \ncase series outside China too.20,25,27,50 While it is \nhighly unlikely for the majority of cigarette smoke \ncompounds to have any potential benefit consid-\nering their toxic characteristics and oxidative \nstress and inflammation-promoting properties, \nsome researchers have hypothesized that these \nfindings might imply a protective effect of nico-\ntine.50–53 It was recently reported that many of the \nclinical manifestations of COVID-19 could be \nexplained by a dysfunction of the nicotinic cho-\nlinergic system, and it was hypothesized that nic-\notine could modulate the immune response by \nrestoring the function of the cholinergic anti-\ninflammatory pathway.52 Severe COVID-19 \nappears to represent a hyper-inflammatory \nresponse that could result from dysregulation of \nthe immune system and a failure to return to \nhomeostasis after being activated to combat viral \ninvasion. SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate \nimmune system, which, if left unregulated, can \nincrease vascular permeability, cause migration of \nfluid and blood cells into the alveoli, and result in \nrespiratory failure.54 This is commonly called \n“cytokine storm”, and is characterized by the \nrelease of several pro-inflammatory cytokines \nsuch as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin \nK Farsalinos, A Barbouni et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/taj\t\n9\n(IL)-1, and IL-6. Elevated levels of these cytokines \nhave been associated with poor prognosis in \nCOVID-19 patients.11,55 The importance of this \nprocess in severe COVID-19 has been recognized \nby the scientific community, and clinical trials of \nimmunosuppressants and cytokine inhibitors are \nalready underway based on biological plausibility \nand despite warnings and precautions against the \nuse of such medication in the presence of active \ninfection.56–60 The cholinergic anti-inflammatory \npathway, mediated mainly through the vagus \nnerve and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine recep-\ntors, has well-established immunomodulatory \neffects that are present in a variety of cells such as \nmacrophages \nand \nbronchial \nepithelial \nand \nendothelial cells.61–64 It represents a reflex mecha-\nnism based on a bi-directional communication \nbetween the immune and nervous systems. \nActivation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory \npathway through electrical stimulation of the \nvagus nerve has been shown to reduce levels of \npro-inflammatory cytokines and control the acute \nhyper-inflammatory response in animal mod-\nels.65,66 Therefore, dysregulation of the choliner-\ngic nervous system could explain the clinical \nmanifestations of severe COVID-19 and the ina-\nbility to suppress and control the inflammatory \nresponse. Notably, risk factors for severe COVID-\n19 such as diabetes, heart disease, ageing and \nobesity are characterized by autonomic nervous \nsystem \nimbalance.67–70 \nThese \npatients \nare \nexpected to be more sensitive to further compro-\nmise of the cholinergic nervous system due to \nSARS-CoV-2 infection.\nNicotine is an agonist of the nicotinic cholinergic \nsystem and has been shown to prevent acute res-\npiratory distress syndrome, the hallmark of severe \nCOVID-19, in animal models.71 Therefore, we \npresent the hypothesis that nicotine intake could \nbe the reason for the low prevalence of smoking \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This \nwould seemingly be in disagreement with the \nhigher odds of adverse outcomes among hospital-\nized COVID-19 smokers. However, it should be \nemphasized that smokers experience abrupt ces-\nsation of nicotine intake after hospital admission \nand are unlikely to receive pharmaceutical nico-\ntine replacement therapies while hospitalized. As \na result, the effects of nicotine will rapidly wean \noff within hours after admission considering that \nthe plasma half-life of nicotine is 1–2 h. Therefore, \nthe higher odds for adverse outcome in current, \ncompared with non-current, smokers are not con-\ntradictory to the hypothesis that nicotine may be \nbeneficial for COVID-19. In addition, any hypoth-\nesized benefits of nicotine are expected to be \nmasked by the well-established adverse effects of \nsmoking and smoking-related comorbidities, \nwhich could also explain the higher odds for \nadverse outcome in hospitalized smokers. Thus, it \nis possible that COVID-19 severity and outcome \nmay differ between smokers without and with \nsmoking-related disease. Therefore, smoking can-\nnot be recommended or used as a protective or \ntherapeutic measure. However, pharmaceutical \nnicotine products have been available for years \nand have been used therapeutically even in non-\nsmokers for longer periods of time compared with \nthe few days that would be needed for a clinical \ntrial of nicotine in COVID-19 patients.72,73 The \nsafety profile and lack of dependence potential \nthat has been observed in these studies, with phar-\nmaceutical nicotine being administered to elderly \nnon-smokers at high doses and for several weeks, \noffers a rationale for future clinical trials of nico-\ntine in COVID-19 patients. In addition, such a \nclinical trial would not need to administer nicotine \nas a substitute for other standardized therapeutic \nmeasures.\nAnother concern in relation to nicotine and \nCOVID-19 refers to its effects on angiotensin \nconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, since \nthis enzyme is used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2 \nfor cell entry.74 Recent data support that nicotine \nupregulates ACE2, which is suggested as a poten-\ntial mechanism to increase susceptibility and \nseverity of COVID-19.75,76 However, this is in \ncontrast with previous data that nicotine and \nsmoking down-regulate ACE2.77 Moreover, up-\nregulation of ACE2 does not necessarily imply \nmore fulminant disease. Concerns that up-regu-\nlation of ACE2 by ACE-inhibitors and angioten-\nsin receptor blockers could be linked to adverse \nprognosis in hypertensive COVID-19 patients \nwere raised early in the COVID-19 pandemic.78 \nHowever, recent studies found either no adverse \neffect or a protective effect associated with the use \nof these medications.79,80 In fact, down-regulation \nof ACE2 immediately after viral cell entry is pro-\nposed as an important mechanism favoring the \nprogression and severity of disease.81 ACE2 defi-\nciency has been observed with ageing, in diabetes \nmellitus, and in heart disease, all of which appear \nto be risk factors for severe COVID-19.82–84 In \nTherapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease 11\n10\t\njournals.sagepub.com/home/taj\naddition, children and young women, who usu-\nally experience mild COVID-19, were found to \nhave higher levels of ACE2 than older people.85 \nThus, it is possible that ACE2 upregulation is \nprotective against severe COVID-19,78,86 and the \ncontradictory data about the effects of nicotine on \nACE2 expression need to be clarified in future \nexperimental studies.\nIn conclusion, this systematic review and meta-\nanalysis of retrospective, observational case series \nidentified a low prevalence of current smoking \namong hospitalized COVID-19 patients but higher \nodds of adverse outcome for current compared \nwith non-current smokers. Smoking cannot be \nconsidered a protective measure against COVID-\n19 (or any other condition) due to associated risk \nfor cardiovascular, respiratory and cancer morbid-\nity and mortality. Thus, smokers should still be \nencouraged to quit. While limitations are applica-\nble to this analysis and other unknown reasons or \nconfounding factors could, at least partially, \nexplain these findings, the hypothesis that nicotine \nmay be protective against severe COVID-19 is bio-\nlogically plausible and should be explored through \nlaboratory and, eventually, clinical trials using \npharmaceutical nicotine products.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe author(s) declared the following potential \nconflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article: KF \nis a non-paid, external associate at the Laboratory \nof Molecular Biology and Immunology of the \nUniversity of Patras.

  "ERJ-01759-2020.pdf": "Could the smoking gun in the fight\nagainst COVID-19 be the (rh)ACE-2?\nTo the Editor:\nTwo interesting publications in the European Respiratory Journal recently by RUSSO et al. [1] and LEUNG\net al. [2] discuss the possible role of nicotine in this pandemic and the “furious pursuit for better\ntherapeutics”.\nNot surprisingly, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is known to be the likely host receptor for\nthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Further, at a basic level, cellular\nmechanisms of nicotinic receptor activity promote SARS-CoV-2 entry and proliferation in epithelial cells\nthrough co-expression of ACE-2. Hence, this is the theory postulated by OLDS and KABBANI [3] for how\nnicotine consumption represents a special risk factor in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nOn the other hand, and very surprisingly, Changeux et al. [4] hypothesise that the nicotinic receptor also\nplays a key role in the pathophysiology and might represent a target for the prevention and control of\nCOVID-19 infection. Again, on a basic level, the hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a nicotinic\nagent which competes with nicotine for the receptor. The backbone of this hypothesis proposes that under\ncontrolled settings, nicotinic agents (such as nicotine patches) could provide an efficient treatment for an\nacute infection such as COVID-19.\nSo, tenuously, is the argument centred around the need for data about alternative nicotine delivery systems\nand their risk/benefit ratio in relation to COVID-19 [5]? Possibly, but are there perhaps other ways…?\nSoluble ACE-2 might impact viral spread, since binding to soluble receptor has been shown to block\nSARS-CoV-2 entry. BATLLE et al. [6] argue that, if given in its soluble form as an appropriate recombinant\nACE-2 protein, this may represent a new tool to combat the spread of COVID-19.\nSimilarly, GUO et al. [7] opined that exogenous supplement of recombinant human (rh)ACE-2 might be a\nbrilliant idea in the treatment of COVID-19. Here the soluble ACE-2 may act as the bait to neutralise the\nspike protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2, thus inhibiting entry. Further, GUO et al. [7] referenced a\nrecent study that demonstrated fusion protein of rhACE-2 (with an Fc fragment) showing high affinity\nbinding to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. This, again, provides a basis for further drug\ndevelopment as fusion protein technology has been very successfully deployed in various therapeutic areas,\nsuch as rheumatology and haemophilia.\nDhamend Lutchman\nPoint Cook, Mebourne, Australia.\nCorrespondence: Dhamend Lutchman, Point Cook, Melbourne, Australia 3030.

[1] published in the European Respiratory\nJournal, the correspondence by RUSSO et al. [2], and also the subsequent comment by the first group [3].\nBoth research teams are reporting increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression in\nairways of current smokers and those with COPD, with important implications for coronavirus disease\n2019 (COVID-19) patients. Since ACE-2 has been shown to be the main receptor utilised by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter the host cells [2], the authors conclude that\nnicotine is a risk factor for COVID-19. RUSSO et al. [2] have shown that nicotine upregulates ACE-2\nthrough α7-nAChRs which are present in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. LEUNG et al. [3] provided\nfurther evidence in support of this hypothesis and propose the repurposing of α7-nAChR antagonists for\nthe pandemic (e.g. methyllycaconitine, α-conotoxin), expecting that such treatment will alter ACE-2\nexpression and prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry.\nWhile this hypothesis is based on laboratory experiments, it is not supported by clinical data. Recent\nobservations on the prevalence of smoking among hospitalised COVID-19 patients have raised some\nimportant issues. Many studies, while based on preliminary data and subject to several limitations (e.g.\nlack of adjustment for confounding factors, possibility for inability to report, inaccurate recording or\nunder-reporting of the smoking status), suggest that the proportion of hospitalised COVID-19 patients\nwho are current smokers is by far lower than expected based on population smoking rates [4, 5]. In one\nstudy, smoking was associated with lower odds of hospitalisation for COVID-19 after adjusting for\ncovariates [6].\nTo further address this issue, we calculated the pooled prevalence of current smoking in 11 published case\nseries (table 1), nine from China and two from the USA [5–15], and compared it to the expected\nprevalence based on gender-adjusted and gender- and age-adjusted population smoking rates in each\ncountry by estimating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) using random effects meta-analysis. Due to the lack\nof data on patients’ age distribution, the age-adjustment for the expected smoking prevalence was\ncalculated by assuming that all patients were aged ⩾65 years, since lower smoking prevalence is observed\nin the elderly compared to younger adult age groups. Population smoking prevalence information was\nderived from the World Health Organization 2018 Global Adult Tobacco Survey [16] for China, and from\nthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (for gender adjustment) [17] and Statista (for gender\nand age adjustment) [18]. The pooled prevalence of smoking was 5.3% (95% CI 3.2–8.0%), while the\ngender adjusted POR was 0.16 (95% CI 0.12–0.23; p<0.001) and the gender- and age-adjusted POR was\n@ERSpublications\nThe prevalence of smoking among hospitalised COVID-19 patients is low.

Despite the many limitations, these observations need to be taken into\nconsideration. Recently, a hypothesis that the nicotinic cholinergic system may be involved in COVID-19\ninfection was presented, based on the fact that several of the symptoms and clinical signs of COVID-19,\nincluding the cytokine storm, could be explained by dysfunction of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory\npathway [19]. α7-nAChRs are potentially involved in modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and\nsuppressing the cytokine storm [20, 21]. Additional clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (such as anosmia\nand thromboembolic complications) can also be associated with dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic\nsystem [19].\nIn conclusion, the observations of a low smoking prevalence among hospitalised COVID-19 patients,\ndespite the important limitations, together with the hypothetical links between dysfunction of the nicotinic\ncholinergic system and clinical manifestations of the disease raise some important research questions,\nconsidering that nicotine is a cholinergic agonist. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the nicotinic\ncholinergic system should be further examined and any proposal for the repurposing of α7-nAChR\nantagonists should be approached with caution, since it could potentially propagate the cytokine storm\nand adversely affect the prognosis. Obviously, smoking cannot be considered protective for COVID-19 (or\nany other disease), but pharmaceutical nicotine products are widely available and their role in COVID-19\nshould be explored.\nKonstantinos Farsalinos\n, Athina Angelopoulou\n, Nikos Alexandris\nand Konstantinos Poulas\nLaboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, Dept of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.\nCorrespondence: Konstantinos Farsalinos, Leoforos Alexandras 196A, Athens 11521, Greece.\nE-mail: kfarsalinos@gmail.com\nReceived: 5 May 2020 | Accepted after revision: 10 May 2020\nConflict of interest: None declared.\nReferences\n1\nLeung JM, Yang CX, Tam A, et al.

[1], highlighting their findings\nthat nicotine induces an increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression in human\nbronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) and is mediated by α7-subtype nicotinic receptors (α7-nAChR). It\nraises the concern that all electronic nicotine-delivery systems may put users at greater risk of succumbing\nto coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nWe [2], along with LEUNG et al. [3], have shown that ACE-2 expression is upregulated in the small airway\nepithelia of smokers and patients with COPD. In particular, we observed increased ACE-2 expression in\ntype-2 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages along with the small airway epithelium of smokers\ncompared to healthy never-smokers [2]. Similar studies are yet to be done in the context of electronic\ncigarettes (e-cigarettes), heat-not-burn devices (IQOS) or waterpipe exposure to human airways. ACE-2 is\nthe binding site for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mediating entry of the\nvirus into cells [4]. Binding affinity between the spike proteins of the virus and ACE-2 on respiratory cells\nhas been identified to be much higher than any previously identified human coronavirus. The significance\nof such overexpression of ACE-2 in smokers should not be ignored. COVID-19 and progression of severe\npneumonia may be more likely to occur in smokers, particularly in those that have smoking-related\ncomorbidities [5]. We are beginning to elucidate the role of traditional cigarette smoking and\nnicotine-driven changes to the lungs in the context of coronavirus transmission and susceptibility.\nCigarette smoke has been identified and linked to increasing expression of the binding site for the cause of\nthe 2020 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) via mediating nicotine receptors. With this, an avoidable and\npotentially gigantic risk-factor has emerged for COVID-19, as the pandemic continues to claim ultimate\ngrasp over the year of 2020.\nHere, we bring to the discussion whether the increased susceptibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 via\nα7-nAChR and the upregulation of small airway ACE-2 expression may also be relevant for those who\nvape using nicotine-based e-cigarettes. E-cigarette vapour studies, although in their infancy, have already\nshown that they can enhance the virulence and inflammatory profile of pathogens such as Streptococcus\npneumoniae, among other deleterious biological effects [6]. Vaping intensifies pneumococcal adherence\nthrough an increase in platelet-activating factor receptor expression, ultimately rendering those who vape\nwith an increased risk of pneumonia [7, 8]. We, among others, have previously shown that e-cigarettes and\nIQOS are not “safer”, as having a vast pro-inflammatory response [9]. We compared cigarette smoke\nversus e-cigarette and IQOS on airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells [9]. All tested pathological\nbiomarkers were elevated in cells exposed to e-cigarette aerosols and IQOS, which included chemokine\nCXCL8, extracellular matrix proteins and markers of mitochondrial dysfunction. We found these products\ntoxic to the cells, evident from decreased cellular viability and integrity. More devastatingly, vaping also\ninterfered with cellular energetics. Our results further substantiate current research that e-cigarettes and\n@ERSpublications\nAbsolute cessation of any tobacco product in any form: implications for COVID-19 https://bit.ly/\n3cyk9ra\nCite this article as: McAlinden KD, Eapen MS, Lu W, et al.

As the scientific evidence mounts, confirming the fears that\ne-cigarettes and IQOS are strongly associated with the development and progression of debilitating lung\ndiseases [10], now may be the prime time to include all electronic nicotine delivery systems in the\nvocalisation of concerns concerning tobacco-related death and disease.\nWe recirculate the simple notion that the lungs are not designed for the chronic inhalation of anything but\nair and that the indication for a smoking- and nicotine-induced increase in ACE2 is more evidence to the\nstacking weight of toxicity that tobacco is for humanity. Given the role of the nicotine receptor, vaping\nmay also lead to the upregulation of ACE-2. Research in this area will be invaluable in the development of\ne-cigarette research and providing trusted, peer-reviewed and real evidence for the youth of the 2020s. We\nstrongly recommend that the World Health Organization and countries act to advance their efforts to\nreduce smoking, vaping and waterpipe use. During a pandemic it is difficult to focus on anything other\nthan the immediate threat. The “primacy of rescue” has overwhelmed preventive action. Additional\nresearch into the relationship of smoking, and all electronic nicotine delivery systems to the infection,\ntransmission and progression of COVID-19 is required. Progress towards easily identifying those\nsusceptible to severe disease or capable of asymptomatic transmission are important goals for managing\nthe disease at a community level. COVID-19 is a dress rehearsal for the next pandemic, and the next, and\nthe one after that: the new norm.\nKielan Darcy McAlinden1, Mathew Suji Eapen\n1, Wenying Lu1, Collin Chia1,2, Greg Haug1,2 and Sukhwinder\nSingh Sohal1\n1Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Health Sciences, College of\nHealth and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia. 2Department of Respiratory Medicine, Launceston\nGeneral Hospital, Launceston, Australia.\nCorrespondence: Sukhwinder Singh Sohal, Respiratory Translational Research Group, Department of Laboratory\nMedicine, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Locked Bag – 1322,\nNewnham Drive, Launceston, Tasmania 7248, Australia.

Lutchman, K.D. McAlinden and co-workers, and K. Farsalinos and co-workers\ntogether capture the divergence in opinion on the impact of smoking on coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) and whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor mediates this\nrelationship. At the heart of this controversy is whether smoking reduces or increases the risk of\ncontracting COVID-19. K. Farsalinos and co-workers, through analysis of the pooled prevalence of current\nsmoking across 11 case series determined that current smoking status was significantly lower than\nexpected gender- and age-adjusted prevalence in COVID-19 patients. That smoking could potentially be\nprotective against COVID-19 has not gone unnoticed by the public. Since late April, multiple media\noutlets have reported on this possibility, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to release a\nwarning on 4 May, 2020, on tobacco use during this pandemic [1]. While we do not dispute that the\nprevalence of smoking in COVID-19 cases has been surprisingly low across the world, we would echo\nWHO’s advice, based on emerging evidence that outcomes in COVID-19 are worse in patients who do\nsmoke. An analysis conducted by KILLERBY et al. [2], of 220 hospitalised and 311 nonhospitalised patients\nwith COVID-19 patients across six acute care hospitals and associated outpatient clinics in metropolitan\nAtlanta, Georgia, for instance, demonstrated that smoking was an independent risk factor for COVID-19\nhospitalisation, carrying an odds ratio of 2.3 (95% CI 1.2–4.5). A recent meta-analysis has also shown that\nsmokers have a relative risk of 1.34 (95% CI 1.07–1.67) of having more severe disease or experiencing\nrefractory or progressive disease [3]. While smoking may not necessarily increase one’s risk for contracting\nCOVID-19, the biological and inflammatory cascade that occurs upon severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may be particularly devastating for a smoker.\nK.D. McAlinden and co-workers raise the possibility that a similar effect could be occurring in patients\nwho vape. Certainly, the risks of significant pulmonary injury with vaping are now well-described in the\nliterature [4], and the multiple ways that vaping can cause cellular damage and impede the lung’s response\nto infection are clearly delineated by the authors. The theoretical possibility that vaping could prime the\nlung for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still hypothetical, given that to date none of the epidemiological studies\nhave reported on vaping prevalence amongst their COVID-19 patients. Several demographic factors,\nhowever, make such estimates unlikely to be obtained with much precision. For instance, consider the\nlandscape of e-cigarette use in China, the first epicentre of COVID-19. A 2018 survey of 10233 individuals\nin five Chinese cities found that only 0.9% had used e-cigarettes within the past 30 days [5]. Only 0.2% of\nthose 65 years and older reported e-cigarette use within the past 30 days compared to 1.5% of those in the\n15–24 year age range. Similarly, in 2016, of 32931 adults included in the US National Health Interview\nSurvey, 1.0% of those over 65 years reported current e-cigarette use compared to 4.6% of the 18–44 year\nage group [6]. Older age groups, the ones more likely to have severe COVID-19, present to a hospital, and\ntherefore be captured by epidemiologists in their surveys, are therefore less likely to report current vaping.\nOn the other hand, it may be difficult to ascertain the prevalence of vaping in younger age groups who are\nmuch more likely to vape, but also much more likely to have mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infections\nthat are not captured, either for their failure to present to a healthcare provider or the constraints placed\non available tests in resource-limited settings. Nonetheless, we would argue for hospitals to capture these\ndata as best they can and hope that data for mild cases in younger outpatients begin to be reported from\naround the world. Similar to smoking, it is possible that vaping may still be associated with worse\noutcomes, if not necessarily being a risk factor for contracting infection in the first place.\nFinally, as D. Lutchman notes, if the culprit player for worse outcomes in smokers in this pandemic is the\nheightened ACE-2 receptor in the airway epithelium, soluble ACE-2 might be a therapeutic option. Indeed,\nwe would agree with the excitement for this approach as this was the subject of a recent study by MONTEIL\n@ERSpublications\nSmoking increases severity of COVID-19 https://bit.ly/2yWp3jb\nCite this article as: Leung JM, Sin DD.

Regression analysis was conducted to ad-\njust for potential confounding factors such as economic activity (gross domestic product), the rate \nof COVID-19 testing, and the stringency of COVID-19 control policies.\nResults:  There was a statistically significant negative association between smoking prevalence \nand the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 European nations after controlling for confounding \nfactors (p = 0.001). A strong association was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 per million \npeople and economic activity (p = 0.002) and the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0006). Nations with \nstricter policy enactment showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people, but the association \nwas not significant (p = 0.122). Delaying policy enactment was associated with a greater preva-\nlence of COVID-19 (p = 0.0535). Evidence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and \nCOVID-19 mortality was not found (p = 0.626). There was a strong positive association between \nCOVID-19 mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) as well as the propor-\ntion of the population over 65 years of age (p = 0.0034) and a negative association with the rate of \nCOVID-19 testing (p = 0.0023).\nConclusions:  We found a negative association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occur-\nrence at the population level in 38 European countries. This association may not imply a true or \ncausal relationship, and smoking is not advocated as a prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\nImplications:  Given the evidence of this ecological study, and of several other studies that found \nan underrepresentation of smoking prevalence in hospitalized cases, it may be worth examining, \nin laboratory experiments and controlled human trials, if nicotine offers any protection against \nCOVID-19. Most importantly, to date, no study, including this one, supports the view that smoking \nacts as a treatment intervention or prophylaxis to reduce the impact or ameliorate the negative \nhealth impacts of COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nThere are numerous published studies on the link between smoking \nand COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 \nvirus, but as Berlin et al. note, there is uncertainty about what conclu-\nsions to draw.1 Evidence from hospital COVID-19 cases in China,2 \nPadova, Italy,3 and New York City4 suggest that smoking preva-\nlence may be lower compared with the general population. Lippi \nand Henry,5 in a meta-analysis of five studies, found no significant \nassociation between smoking and increased risk of developing severe \nCOVID-19. In contrast, a meta-analysis by Vardavas and Nikitara,6 \nand another recent meta-analysis of 19 papers comparing the risk \nof progression of COVID-19 among smokers relative to individuals \nthat never smoked,7 concluded that smoking is most likely associ-\nated with increase severity and poorer outcomes of COVID-19.\nThe relationship between smoking and COVID-19 is further \ncomplicated when considering that smoking is known to increase \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/22/9/1646/5866017 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1647\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2020, Vol. 22, No. 9\nthe occurrence of multiple respiratory illnesses8 and can lead to an \nincreased risk of lung cancer.9 One factor associated with progres-\nsion of COVID-19 pneumonia is a patient’s smoking history.10,11 \nHowever, the observation of reduced prevalence of smoking among \nhospitalized COVID-19 cases has resulted in the hypothesis that the \nintake of nicotine or other constituents in smoke by active smokers \nmay reduce the likelihood of developing COVID-19 disease,3,5,12 \nalthough no mechanism to explain how this might happen exists. \nClues may lie with the nicotinic receptor.13\nMethods\nAn ecological study was conducted including European Union (EU) \nand Eurozone (EURO) nations. Cognizant that these areas have \nrich cultural diversity, including smoking habits, we wanted to as-\ncertain any link between the occurrence of COVID-19 cases per \nmillion people as of May 30, 2020 and smoking prevalence across \nthe general population using regression analysis and controlling for \nconfounding factors such as economic activity, the rate of COVID-\n19 testing, and strength of COVID-19 control policies. Furthermore, \nwe investigated the association between smoking prevalence and \nCOVID-19 mortality per million people, through regression analysis \ncontrolling for COVID-19 cases per million people as well as other \nconfounding factors.\nThe study included 38 European, 27 EU, and 19 EURO nations \n(Supplementary Table S1). All data were obtained from Our World \nin Data on May 30, 2020. Total COVID-19 cases, deaths, and tests \nreported on this date were converted to values per million people \nto control for population size. Smoking prevalence was measured \nusing the 2016 prevalence rate or percentage of smokers among the \nadult population and converted to the number of smokers per mil-\nlion people. The variable “proportion of the population > 65 years \nof age” was constructed in a similar way to reflect the proportion of \nelderly people in the population. Economic activity was measured \nusing, as a surrogate, gross domestic product (GDP). Policies in the \nEuropean nations were controlled using the maximum COVID-19 \nResponse Stringency-Index (SI) version 6 (May 28, 2020) that a na-\ntion reached from January 1, 2020 to May 27, 2020 (Supplementary \nFigure 1) as well as a measure of delay of enactment of COVID-19 \ncontrol policies measured by the number of days until the occurrence \nof the first nonzero value in the SI from January 1 when nations \ncould have acted.\nResults\nSupplementary Table S2 shows some initial descriptive statistics \nof the top five high and low smoking prevalence nations. At one \nextreme, 43.4% of the adult population of Greece smokes, but it \nhad the lowest prevalence of COVID-19 cases per million people \n(280) on May 30, 2020, but on the other extreme is Iceland, with \nonly 14.7% of its population that smokes, but with a prevalence \nof COVID-19 cases per million people that is 19 times larger than \nthat of Greece. The five nations with the highest smoking prevalence \nare located in the eastern part of Europe with an average smoking \nprevalence of 39.5% of the adult population, 1084 COVID-19 cases \nper million, 29 COVID-19 deaths per million people, 29,375 tests \nper million people and an average GDP per capita of $18,733. In \ncontrast, the five nations with the lowest smoking prevalence are \nfrom the wealthier part of Europe. These countries have an average \nsmoking prevalence rate of 18.6% (i.e., almost 50% lower), an \naverage GDP per person of $49 100 (i.e., a 2.6 times higher standard \nof living), an average of 2754 COVID-19 cases per million people \n(i.e., 2.5 times larger), 133 COVID-19 mortalities per million people \n(i.e., 4.7 times higher), and have conducted 77 546 COVID-19 tests \nper million people (i.e., 2.6 times more). In terms of policy to contain \nthe spread of COVID-19, the top five smoking prevalence nations \nhave a higher maximum SI on average and less delay to act, as meas-\nured by the number of days since first policy enactment as per the SI. \nThe simple Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient between smoking \nprevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (in logs) is −0.575 \n(p < 0.0001) with 95% confidence interval (−0.756, −0.313).\nRegression results for 36 European nations, due to missing SI \nvalues for two nations, showed an explained variation of approxi-\nmately 58% in the prevalence rate of COVID-19 cases per million \npeople across these diverse nations by the independent variables \n(Supplementary Table S3). Nations with a higher number of smokers \nper million people showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people \n(p = 0.001; Figure 1), after controlling for the confounding factors. \nHigh smoking prevalence was associated with a lower prevalence of \nCOVID-19 per million people and vice versa. The effect size indi-\ncated that a nation that had 10% more smokers per million people \nexperienced a 15% lower COVID-19 prevalence per million people \nfor the 36 European nations. This size effect increased to 16% for \nthe EU nations (p = 0.0287) and to 22% for the Eurozone nations \n(p = 0.0086). Figure 1 shows that high smoking prevalence and a low \nprevalence of COVID-19 cases occurred mostly in Eastern European \nnations, whereas low smoking prevalence and a high occurrence of \nCOVID-19 cases per million people occurred in wealthier European \nnations, after adjusting the prevalence rate of COVID-19 cases for \nthe impact of confounding factors (and reconfirming the descriptive \nstatistics in Supplementary Table S2).\nRegarding the other potential explanatory factors, results show \nthat more economic activity, as measured by the GDP of a nation, \nwas associated with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 cases per mil-\nlion people relative to nations with lower GDP (p = 0.002). Nations \nwith a higher rate of COVID-19 testing had a higher prevalence of \nCOVID-19 cases per million people (p = 0.0006) after controlling \nfor the size of the economy, smoking habits, and policies to contain \nthe spread of the virus. There was an association between a more \nstringent COVID-19 policy response, as measured by the maximum \nSI index during the January 1 to May 30 period (Supplementary \nFigure 1), and less COVID-19 cases per million people, but this was \nnot statistically significant (p = 0.122). There was no statistically sig-\nnificant association between degree of delay in policy enactment and \nCOVID-19 prevalence.\nResults for analyses restricted to the 25 EU nations were similar, \nwith smoking prevalence retaining its significant association with \nCOVID-19 prevalence (p =0.0287), but the two policy response \nvariables were non-significant. Considering the 17 EURO nations, \nthe results still hold for smoking prevalence (p = 0.0086), but there \nwas evidence of association of increased occurrence of COVID with \ngreater degree of delay in the policy response (p = 0.0535).\nSupplementary Table S2 also shows that nations with more \nCOVID-19 cases per million people had more COVID-19 deaths per \nmillion people after controlling for all other factors. We found no evi-\ndence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and COVID-\n19 mortality in all 36 European countries or the EU or Eurozone \nnations (e.g., p = 0.6260 for all European nations). Other results in-\nclude the following. Nations with a greater population >65 years of \nage per million people had a significantly higher COVID-19 mortality \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/22/9/1646/5866017 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1648\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2020, Vol. 22, No. 9\nper million people in the 38 European nations group (p = 0.003). \nTests per million people was significantly negatively associated with \ndeaths per million people, except within the Eurozone countries (i.e., \np = 0.0023 for the 38 European nations, p = 0.0057 for the EU na-\ntions and p = 0.1014 for the Eurozone nations).\nDiscussion\nWe found a statistically significant negative correlation between the \nlevel of smoking in the adult population and prevalence of reported \nCOVID-19 cases as of May 30, 2020 across 36 European nations \nafter controlling for potential confounders such as economic activity, \nthe rate of COVID-19 testing and strength of containment policies. \nThe data did not show any association between smoking prevalence \nand COVID-19 mortality per million people. Furthermore, the evi-\ndence shows that a higher COVID-19 testing rate, acting as a po-\ntential indicator of policy action, results in a lower mortality rate \nwhen controlling for the COVID-19 prevalence rate and the other \nconfounding factors. Nations with a higher age ≥65 population have \na higher mortality rate when all 38 nations were examined but were \nnot significant at the 5% level for the two other subgroups. This \nis most likely due to the greater variation in population >65 years \nof age per million people among all 38 nations than in the EU or \nEurozone nations making it difficult to detect a potential association.\nThe study has a number of limitations. As Berlin et al. stated,3 \nconclusions cannot be drawn about any association as these studies, \nincluding this ecological study, which is at the macro level, are de-\nscriptive in nature and cross-sectional. Although an attempt was \nmade to control for the most important factors such as size of the \neconomy, policies, and the rate of COVID-19 testing, there could still \nbe other important missing confounding factors that have not been \ncontrolled for, or residual confounding factors due to inadequate \nmeasurement of potential confounding factors.\nPotential confounding factors omitted from this study include \nlevels of air pollution, levels of comorbid diseases, COVID-19 clus-\ntering within a nation, and rate of international traveler arrivals. \nIdeally, an adjustment for the general level of interaction within each \ncountry’s population would need to be carried out, but such data are \nnot easily available in practice.\nOne of the most important confounding factors are the strin-\ngency policies, as assessed by the SI, to contain the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic within the participating countries which this study attempted \nto control for. However, we were unable to establish an association \nwith a high degree of confidence. Most likely, this is because there \nwas limited variation in the strength of policy responses between \nnations (Supplementary Figure S1). Another problem is that the \npolicy response for most governments was likely to be reactive, \nrather than proactive, and most stringent policies may have been \nenacted in response to a high prevalence of COVID-19, making it \ndifficult to detect a cross-sectional association between policies and \nthe prevalence of COVID-19. Also, we did not control for the rate \nof relaxation of COVID-19 containment policies. The data show \nthat all of the European nations examined in this research relaxed \ntheir containment policies before May 30, as per the SI. A potential \nissue with the strong negative association between smoking preva-\nlence and the occurrence of COVID-19 in European nations is that \nFigure 1.  Number of smokers versus COVID-19 cases in European nations. All variables were transformed to natural logarithms. COVID-19 cases per million \npeople was adjusted for the influence of other confounding factors and standardized against standardized number of smokers per million people. The partial \ncorrelation coefficient is −0.576 (p < 0.001) with a 95% confidence interval (−0.761, −0.306), very similar to the simple Pearson correlation coefficient −0.575 \n(p < 0.001) with a 95% CI (−0.756, −0.313), indicating that the confounding factors controlled for did not distort the simple linear association that had been \ndetected, either because these confounding factors are uncorrelated with the smoking prevalence rate or have an offseting impact on the COVID-19 prevalence \nwhen the smoking rate was correlated with the confounding factors. Smoking prevalence was negatively correlated with the rate of COVID-19 testing but was \npositively correlated with Max Stringency-Index.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/22/9/1646/5866017 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1649\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2020, Vol. 22, No. 9\nconfounding factors are poorly measured and residual confounding \nmay be present. For example, it is possible that the level of testing \nmight not be measuring the level of effective testing, or that the test \nemployed may not be specific enough.14 One possibility is that lower \nincome countries, despite having fewer tests per million people, may \nalso have poorer quality tests and less well-targeted testing. Hence, \nan adjustment exclusively based on the number of tests would not \nfully capture differences between countries in the effectiveness of the \ntesting regime.\nFinally, in this study, we examined the factors that are associated \nwith total cases per million people at a single point in time, namely \nobservations on May 30, 2020. It is possible that our results may be \naffected by the subsequent progression of the COVID-19 epidemic in \neach country. This could be investigated in a subsequent study once \nthe epidemic has subsided. This highlights the importance of further \ninvestigations to assess whether the findings of this preliminary eco-\nlogical study are supported by data in subsequent epidemiological \nresearch. For example, further ecological studies could be carried out \nto investigate variation in COVID-19 occurrence and mortality with \nsmoking prevalence in the United States at the general population \nlevel, similar to this study.\nIn conclusion, given the evidence from this ecological study, \nand of several other studies that found an underrepresentation of \nsmoking prevalence in hospitalized cases, it may be worth examining \nin laboratory experiments and controlled human trials if nicotine \nor other compounds in cigarette smoke offer any protection against \nCOVID-197,13. However, we stress that no study, including this one, \nsupports the view that smoking acts as a treatment intervention or \nprophylaxis to reduce the impact or ameliorate the negative health \nimpacts of COVID-19.\nSupplementary Material\nA Contributorship Form detailing each author’s specific involvement with this \ncontent, as well as any supplementary data, are available online at https://\nacademic.oup.com/ntr.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors thank the editors and peer reviewer for excellent advice and as-\nsistance over several rounds of revisions.\nDeclaration of Interests\nNone declared.\nData Availability\nData file is available upon reasonable request.\nReferences\n\t1.\t Berlin I, Thomas D, Le Faou AL, Cornuz J.

There is a \ncontroversy over smokers’ risk of COVID-19 infection. Smoking is a risk factor \nfor COVID-19 disease progression, and the outbreak of COVID-19 may change \npeople’s smoking behaviors. This study assessed people’s attitudes towards \n‘smoking and COVID-19’ and changes of smoking behaviors before and after \nthe outbreak of COVID-19.\nMETHODS A cross-sectional web survey of 11009 adults in China was conducted \nbetween 7 May and 3 August 2020. Attitudes towards ‘smoking and COVID-19’ \nwere compared among non-smokers (n=8837), ex-smokers (n=399) and current \nsmokers (n=1773), and changes in smoking behaviors before and after the \noutbreak of COVID-19 were assessed among current smokers.  \nRESULTS  Fewer current smokers (26.2%) agreed with the statement that ‘Current \nsmokers are more likely than ex-smokers or non-smokers to contract COVID-19’ \ncompared with non-smokers (53%) or ex-smokers (41.4%); fewer current smokers \n(55.9%) agreed with the statement ‘If contracted, current smokers are more likely \nthan ex-smokers or non-smokers to risk disease progression’ compared with non-\nsmokers (75.5%) or ex-smokers (68.7%). There were no changes in cigarettes \nsmoked per day (mean ± SD: 13.3 ± 9.55 vs 13.4 ± 9.69, p=0.414), percentage \nof daily smokers (70.8% vs 71.1%, p=0.882) and percentage of smokers with \nmotivation to quit (intend to quit within the next 6 months, 9.4% vs 10.9%, \np=0.148) before and after the outbreak of COVID-19.\nCONCLUSIONS The survey found that fewer current smokers agreed that smoking is \na risk-factor for COVID-19 compared with non-smokers or ex-smokers. Among \ncurrent smokers, there were no changes in their cigarette consumption and \nmotivation to quit before and after the outbreak of COVID-19.

A large \nsurvey of adults in the UK found that prevalence \nof confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current \nsmokers (0.56%) than never smokers (0.26%) and \nex-smokers (0.19%)3. Research indicates that smoking \nis a risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression4-6, \nespecially among younger adults7. However, evidence \nalso showed a low prevalence of current smoking \namong hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and \nShort Report\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2022;20(February):18\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/144242\n2\ncurrent smokers were more likely to have an adverse \noutcome compared with non-current smokers but less \nlikely compared with ex-smokers8.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 may change people’s \nsmoking behaviors. A survey study in England \nexamined the changes in smoking behaviors following \nthe COVID-19 lockdown and found that smokers are \nmore likely than before the lockdown to report trying \nto quit smoking, and rates of smoking cessation are \nhigher9. However, these changes remain unknown \namong people from China. \nThe primary objective of this study is to assess \nthe attitudes of current smokers, ex-smokers and \nnon-smokers towards ‘smoking and COVID-19’ and \nchanges of smoking behaviors among Chinese before \nand after the outbreak of COVID-19. Considering \npeople received a great deal of information about \nCOVID-19, as well as well-documented knowledge \nabout the association between smoking and health \nrisks, we hypothesized that most people would agree \nthat smoking was a risk-factor for COVID-19; and that \ncompared with before the outbreak of COVID-19, \nChinese smokers might smoke fewer cigarettes per \nday and have stronger motivation to quit smoking at \npresent. \nMETHODS\nParticipants and design\nThe sample included 11009 participants from \nChina. Participants were: aged ≥18 years; willing to \nparticipant, being able to read Chinese; and being able \nto complete an online survey.  \nAll eligible participants were invited to complete \nsociodemographic information and attitudes towards \n‘smoking and COVID-19’. \nThe web survey was conducted from 7 May to 3 \nAugust 2020. Informed consent was obtained from \neach eligible participant before completing a 10–30 \nmin demographic questionnaire and measures of \naddictive behaviors (data on other addictive behaviors \nwere reported elsewhere10). \nThe web survey was performed using a professional \nonline survey service Questionnaire Star (https://\nwww.wjx.cn), released nationwide through social \nmedia (such as WeChat, Weibo, QQ). A previous \nstudy has indicated the reliability and validity of \nonline surveys for assessing smoking behaviors and \nthoughts11. The survey allowed only one response per \nphone or computer. Considering that respondents \ncould share the same internet and same IP address \nwith their families, this study did not limit the number \nof questionnaires from the same IP address. However, \nthe data had no multiple entries with the same IP \naddress. \nParticipation \nThis study did not involve patients. Participants were \nnot involved in the design of the research. This study \nwas in compliance with the principles included in the \nDeclaration of Helsinki. The research protocol was \napproved by The Ethics Committee of Sir Run Run \nShaw Hospital, an affiliate of Zhejiang University, \nMedical College (No. 2020-0505-33). Participants \nwere informed about the purpose, assessments, \npotential risks and benefits of the study before \nconsenting. Digital consent form was provided to each \nparticipant. At the bottom of the consent form, they \ncould choose to ‘agree to participate’ or ‘disagree to \nparticipant’. No personal information was collected, \nand all information from the data cannot be linked \nback to the participants.\nMeasures\nSmoking status was based on the following definitions:\nCurrent smokers – those who have smoked 100 \ncigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke daily \n(‘everyday’ smoker) or on some days (‘somedays’ \nsmoker); \nEx-smokers – those who have smoked at least 100 \ncigarettes in their lifetime but had quit smoking in the \nlast 28 days at the time of the survey; and \nNever smokers or non-smokers – those who had \nsmoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and \ncurrently not smoking. \nCurrent smokers and ex-smokers completed \nquestions about their smoking history and quitting \ninformation. Current smokers also completed \nquestions about smoking behaviors (quantity and \nfrequency) and motivation to quit before (one month \nbefore December 2019) and after the outbreak of \nCOVID-19 (within one month of the survey period 7 \nMay to 3 August 2020), as well as nicotine dependence \n(Fagerström test for nicotine dependence, FTND) at \nthe time of the survey. Attitudes towards ‘smoking \nand COVID-19’ were asked by the following two \nquestions: ‘Are current smokers more likely than \nShort Report\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2022;20(February):18\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/144242\n3\nex-smokers or non-smokers to contract coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19)?’ and ‘If contracted, are \ncurrent smokers more likely than ex-smokers or \nnon-smokers to risk disease progression?’. Each \nquestion used a 5-point Likert scale: ‘strongly agree’, \n‘somewhat agree’, ‘neither agree nor disagree’, \n‘somewhat disagree’, and ‘strongly disagree’. \nData analysis \nA user-specified Excel file was downloaded from the \ndatabase. Statistical analysis was performed using \nSPSS (Version 22.0). Descriptive statistics, chi-\nsquared (χ2) test and dependent t-tests were applied \nto measure outcomes. Statistical significance was \nassumed for two-sided p<0.05.\nRESULTS\nSociodemographic information \nAmong the 11009 participants, 42.8% were males, \n55.2% were aged ≤34 years, 96.1% received tertiary \neducation, 96.3% were employed, 59.5% were \nmarried, 94.9% were from urban areas, 80.3% were \nnon-smokers, 16.1% were current smokers, 3.6% \nwere ex-smokers, and 6.26% (n=136, among current \nsmokers and ex-smokers) had made a quit attempt \nduring the outbreak of COVID-19. The average age \n(mean ± SD) was 34.9 ± 10.13 in males and 32.3 ± \n9.82 in females (p<0.001).  \nSociodemographic information by gender \nAmong males, 57.6% were non-smokers, 34.8% were \ncurrent smokers, and 7.6% were ex-smokers; among \nfemales, 97.3% were non-smokers, 2.1% were current \nsmokers, and 0.6% were ex-smokers.\nSociodemographic information by smoking \nstatus \nNon-smokers (n=8837) were 30.7% male, 59.2% aged \n≤34 years, 93.3% received tertiary education, 96.6% \nwere employed, 56.4% were married, and 94.7% were \nfrom urban areas.

Furthermore, fewer ex-smokers agreed \nthat smoking was a risk-factor for COVID-19 infection \n(p<0.001), and that smoking was associated with \nworse outcomes of COVID-19 (p=0.002) compared \nwith non-smokers. \nSmoking behaviors before and after the \noutbreak of COVID-19\nComparing the smoking behaviors of current smokers \nbefore and after the outbreak of COVID-19, there \nwere no changes in cigarette consumption (number \nof cigarettes smoked per day 13.3 ± 9.55 vs 13.4 ± \n9.69, p=0.414), percentage of daily smokers (70.8% \nvs 71.1%, p=0.882) and percentage of smokers with \nmotivation to quit (within the next 6 months, 9.4% \nvs 10.9%, p=0.148). Almost half of (45.2%) current \nsmokers had no previous quit attempts, but 96% of \nex-smokers had made multiple previous quit attempts. \nNicotine dependence at the time of the survey was \nreported by current smokers as follow: 45.9% very \nlow/no dependence (FTND score: <4), 43.3% low to \nmedium dependence (FTND score: 4–6), and 10.8% \nhigh dependence (FTND score: >6). \nDISCUSSION\nCompared with non-smokers, fewer current smokers \nagreed that smoking was a risk-factor for COVID-19. \nThe outbreak of COVID-19 did not change their \ncigarette comsumption and did not motivate them to \nquit smoking.\nMore than half of non-smokers agreed with the \nstatement  ‘Current smokers are more likely than \nex-smokers or non-smokers to contract coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19)’, but only about a quarter \nof current smokers agreed with it. Even with evidence \nshowing that smoking has been associated with \nCOVID-19 disease progression5, only around half \nof current smokers agreed with the statement ‘If \ncontracted, current smokers are more likely than ex-\nsmokers or non-smokers to risk disease progression’, \nwhich was significantly lower than that among non-\nsmokers, indicating the lack of knowledge about the \nharms of smoking among current smokers12.\nThis study also found there were no significant \nchanges in smoking behaviors before and after the \noutbreak of COVID-19. Smokers smoked almost the \nsame amount of cigarettes per day, and about 70% \nwere daily smokers. Furthermore, there were also no \nsignificant changes in motivation to quit, with very \nfew (about 10%) current smokers considering quiting \nsmoking within the next 6 months. However, research \nfrom England9 and Hong Kong13 found that the \nCOVID-19 lockdown was associated with increased \nmotivation to quit and cessation. Furthermore, a \nDutch online survey found that smokers smoked \nless (14.1%) or more (18.9%) cigarettes due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic14. Although no statistically \nsignificant differences were observed in motivation \nto quit before and after the outbreak of COVID-19, \nslightly more current smokers (1.5%) were motivated \nto quit after the outbreak of COVID-19. Promoting \ncurrent smokers to quit can minimize the risks \nassociated with the current coronavirus pandemic. \nImplementing stronger tobacco control policies in \nChina during the outbreak of COVID-19 may greatly \nencourage smokers to quit. \n \nLimitations\nThe study had several limitations. First, the sample \nwas not representative of the adult population of \nChina. According to China’s National Bureau of \nStatistics  (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2020/\nindexch.htm), 48.91% of the Chinese population are \nfemale, and urban population accounts for 60.6% of \nthe total population and the prevalence of smoking \nin the current study is lower (16.1%) than that of the \ngeneral population (26.6%) reported by The Global \nAdult Tobacco Survey (GATS) China 2018 (https://\nwww.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/global/pdfs/en/\nGATS_China_2018_FactSheet.pdf). Second, in \naddition to selection bias, recall bias would have \noccurred due to the retrospective nature of the \nstudy. Third, changes in smoking behavior were \nnot examined among former smokers. Fourth, this \nsurvey assessed quit attemps during the outbreak \nof COVID-19, but did not assess whether current \nand ex-smokers had attempted to quit or stopped \nsmoking due to COVID-19. If they had tried and \nfailed in their quit attempts, then this could have \nimpacted their attitudes. Fifth, data were collected \nrelatively early in the pandemic, participants’ \nattitudes and smoking behaviors may have changed \nsince then. \nShort Report\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2022;20(February):18\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/144242\n5\nCONCLUSIONS \nThis study found that, unlike non-smokers and ex-\nsmokers, many current smokers did not think that \nsmoking is a risk-factor for COVID-19, and smokers \nfrom this sample neither reduced their cigarette \nconsumption nor increased their motivation to quit \nsmoking during the outbreak of COVID-19. More \nefforts are needed to educate smokers about the \nhealth risks of smoking, as well as efforts to promote \ntheir motivation to quit smoking. \nREFERENCES\n1.\t Chen Z, Peto R, Zhou M, et al.

COVID-19 is a new pneumonia. It has been\nhypothesized that tobacco smoking history may\nincrease severity of this disease in the patients once\ninfected by the underlying coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\nbecause smoking and COVID-19 both cause lung\ndamage.However, thishypothesishasnotbeentested.\nObjective. Current study was designed to focus on\nsmoking history in patients with COVID-19 and test\nthishypothesisthattobaccosmokinghistoryincreases\nrisk for severe COVID-19 by damaging the lungs.\nMethods and results. This was a single-site, retrospec-\ntive case series study of clinical associations,\nbetween epidemiological ﬁndings and clinical man-\nifestations, radiographical or laboratory results. In\nour\nwell-characterized\ncohort\nof\n954\npatients\nincluding 56 with tobacco smoking history, smok-\ning history increased the risk for severe COVID-19\nwith an odds ratio (OR) of 5.5 (95% CI: 3.1–9.9;\nP = 7.3 × 10−8). Meta-analysis of ten cohorts for\n2891 patients together obtained an OR of 2.5 (95%\nCI: 1.9–3.3; P < 0.00001). Semi-quantitative anal-\nysis of lung images for each of ﬁve lobes revealed a\nsigniﬁcant difference in neither lung damage at\nﬁrst examination nor dynamics of the lung damage\nat different time-points of examinations between\nthe smoking and nonsmoking groups. No signiﬁ-\ncant differences were found either in laboratory\nresults including D-dimer and C-reactive protein\nlevels except different covariances for density of the\nimmune cells lymphocyte (P = 3.8 × 10−64) and\nneutrophil (P = 3.9 × 10−46).\nConclusion. Tobacco smoking history increases the\nrisk for great severity of COVID-19 but this risk is\nachieved unlikely by affecting the lungs.\nKeywords: addiction,\nepidemiology,\nlung\ndamage,\nSARS-CoV-2, substance use disorders.\nIntroduction\nThe highly contagious severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome\ncoronavirus\n2\n(SARS-CoV-2)\nhas\ninfected more than nine million people worldwide\nduring the last six months [1, 2]. The resultant\nnovel\npneumonia\ncoronavirus\ndisease\n2019\n(COVID-19) displays various symptoms amongst\nthe patients including asymptomatic carriers, mild\nclinical\nmanifestations\nand\nsevere\ncases\nthat\nrequire treatments in intensive care unit (ICU) or\nlead to deaths [3].\nMany factors, environmental or endogenous, may\nhave contributed to the severity of this disease\nbut tobacco smoking has stood out ﬁrst without\ndirect research simply because both SARS-CoV-2\nand smoking directly affect the lung. This com-\nmon knowledge has led to a widely accepted\nassumption that tobacco smoking history may\npredispose\nthe\ninfected\nto\nsevere\npneumonia.\nHowever, currently there is no evidence for such\nenvironmental\nexacerbation,\nthat\nis\nwhether\nCOVID-19 patients with smoking history carry\nmore damage in their lungs than those without\nsmoking history.\n†Equal contribution.\n574\nª 2020 The Authors.

As a likely reason, none of these reported\nstudies were designed to investigate the associa-\ntion. It therefore remains elusive whether tobacco\nsmoking history affects the disease progression so\nthat a careful study is warranted.\nIn order to clarify the possible association and\nfurther ﬁnd lung-based supporting evidence for the\nassociation, we have carried out the ﬁrst retro-\nspective case series study focused on effects of\ntobacco smoking on lungs with COVID-19, as\noutlined in Fig. 1, by semi-quantitative analysis of\nCT chest images with lung damage score, at the\ninitial encounter, and longitudinal changes in the\nscore at different time-points thereafter.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design and patients\nAll patients were admitted and diagnosed with\nCOVID-19 at Wuhan Red Cross Hospital (WRCH) of\nChina. Conﬁrmation with reverse transcriptase–-\npolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for\nSARS-CoV-2 was required for inclusion in this\nstudy. Lengths of illness and hospital stay with\ndischarge or before death were all recorded com-\npletely. Informed consent was granted by the\nWRCH\nCommittee\nand\nwritten\nconsent\nwas\nobtained from each patient for collection of biolog-\nical samples after review and approval of the study\nprotocol by WRCH institutional review committee\n(IRB) on 04/02/2020.\nQuantiﬁcation of smoking history\nAt\nadmission,\neach\npatient\nwas\nasked\nabout\ntobacco smoking history in details, including cur-\nrent and past, average number of cigarettes per day\nand years of smoking. Since background smoking,\naccumulated smoking and smoking year all matter\n[9, 10], we deﬁned a smoker as one who had\nconsistently smoked tobacco for at least ﬁve years\nand used both pack-year and smoking year to\nestimate smoking history.\nMeta-analysis\nAs described before [11], literature search, in both\nEnglish and Chinese, went through the PubMed\nand the Chinese Medical Journal Network (med-\njournals.cn) from December 2019 to March 2020\nby using the keywords ‘COVID-19’, ‘2019-nCov’,\n‘coronavirus’, combined with ‘clinical characteris-\ntics’. The disease was deﬁned as by the guidance\nissued by the Chinese National Health Committee.\nThis period of time was chosen to match when the\npatients in our cohort were admitted to WRCH.

Bias risk was\nassessed and studies with current smoking only\nwere\nexcluded,\nresulting\nnine\nstudies\nto\nbe\nincluded here [3, 12-19]. For the Chen N et al\nstudy, only patients with certain status/hospital-\nization outcomes by the time of their report were\nused. Meta-analysis of data extracted from these\nnine studies, along with our own data, was carried\nout via RevMan 5.3 from Cochrane Collaboration’s\nprogram [20] for various parameters including\nodds ratio (OR) and its 95% conﬁdence interval\n(CI), heterogeneity and publication bias.\nComputed tomography (CT) chest scan\nChest was scanned with 1-mm slice thickness CT\non a Siemens SOMATOM go.Top 64 scanner (Sie-\nmens Healthineers, Suzhou, China), by using a\nﬁeld of view (FOV) 413 × 413 mm, tube voltage\n130 kV, tube current 138 mA, pitch 0.6, recon-\nstruction layer thickness 1.5 mm. Lung image\nreconstruction relied on a high-resolution algo-\nrithm. All images were reviewed and consensus\nreached by two radiologists with approximately ﬁve\nyears of experience each, followed by reporting and\nrecording.\nCT image analysis\nEach CT chest image was examined for presence of\nthese features: (1) ground-glass opacities, (2) con-\nsolidation, (3) laterality of ground-glass opacities\nand consolidation, (4) number of lobes affected\nwhere either ground-glass or consolidative opaci-\nties were present, (5) degree of involvement of each\nlung lobe in addition to overall extent of lung\ninvolvement measured by means of a ‘total severity\nscore’ as detailed below, (6) nodules, (7) a pleural\neffusion, (8) thoracic lymphadenopathy (deﬁned as\nlymph node size of ≥10 mm in short-axis dimen-\nsion), (9) airways abnormalities (including airway\nwall thickening, bronchiectasis and endoluminal\nsecretions), (10) axial distribution of disease (cat-\negorized as no axial distribution of disease, central\n‘peribronchovascular’\npredominant\ndisease,\nor\nperipheral predominant disease) and (11) related\nlung disease including emphysema and ﬁbrosis.\nOther abnormalities, such as linear opacities,\nopacities with a rounded morphology, opacities\nwith a ‘reverse halo’ sign, opacities with a ‘crazy-\npaving’ pattern, and opacities with intralesional\ncavitation, were noted too. Ground-glass opaciﬁ-\ncation\nwas\ndeﬁned\nas\nhazy\nincreased\nlung\nattenuation with preservation of bronchial and\nvascular margins; consolidation, opaciﬁcation with\nobscuration of margins of vessels and airway walls\n[21, 22]. A total of twenty features were examined\nand scored.\nLung damage scoring\nThe right lung is slightly bigger than the left and\ncommon practice is to examine three lobes on the\nright and two on the left. Per cent bin-based\n‘blindly’ scoring was used to semi-quantify lung\ndamage. Each of the ﬁve lung lobes (left up, left\nlow, right up, right middle and right low) was\nassessed for degree of involvement and classiﬁed\nas none (0%), minimal (1–25%), mild (26–50%),\nmoderate\n(51–75%)\nor\nsevere\n(76–100%),\nas\nreported [23]. No involvement corresponded to a\nlobe score of 0, minimal to a lobe score of 1, mild to\na lobe score of 2, moderate to a lobe score of 3,\nsevere to a lobe score of 4 and extensive to a lobe\nscore of 5. An overall lung damage was estimated\nby combining all ﬁve lobe scores (range of possible\nscores, 0–20). In additional, we marked ‘0’ for\nabsence and ‘1’ for the presence of the features\nmentioned above. People who gave the scores were\nunaware of this study. The amount of time between\nthe initial appearance of patient symptoms (onset)\nand the date of admission, the dates of CT exam-\ninations and the date of discharge or death were all\nrecorded for each patient, to calculate illness days\n(iDays, from onset to discharge), hospital days and\nrates of change in lung damage scores.\nQuantiﬁcation of change in lung damage\nRate of change in damage score (Rs) was estimated\nas\nRs ¼\nSn \u0002Sm\niDayn \u0002iDaym\nwhere S was for score, n and m for iDays n and m;\niDay was counted by setting onset as iDay = 0, and\nso on, so that m could be ‘0’, the onset day. There\nwas no additional CT scan between m and n.\nRelated clinical care\nAs part of standard care, laboratory tests of blood\ncell count, kidney and liver functions, and C-\nreactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels\nwere\nperformed\nfor\nall\nCOVID-19\npatients\nat\nWRCH.\nTobacco smoking & severe COVID-19\n/ J.

Algo-\nrithms implemented in Prism GraphPad (v5) were\nused for data analyses, including Student’s one- or\ntwo-tailed t-tests of means, F-tests of variances,\nmodelling\nof\nlinear\ncorrelations,\npoint-to-point\nchange in individual’s score, and estimation of\naverage Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (r). P-value\n(PT from t-test and PF from F-test) of < 0.05 was\nconsidered as statistically signiﬁcant, with Bonfer-\nroni for multiple testing.\nResults\nThis study registered 954 patients with COVID-19\nincluding 898 nonsmokers and 56 age-matched\nsmokers who were admitted to Wuhan Red Cross\nHospital of China. The smoking group had bit\nshorter duration of illness or hospitalization than\nthe nonsmoking group (Fig. 2a), and an average of\n28.5 pack-years or 30 years of smoking history\n(Fig. 2b,c).\nIn this smoking cohort, smoking history increased\nthe risk signiﬁcantly for severe forms (ICU recovery\nand death) of this disease. We included required\ntreatment in ICU and death as the severe forms of\nthis\ndisease.\nEpidemiologically,\n39.3%\nof\nthe\npatients with smoking history showed severe dis-\nease, comparing to 10.5% of those without smok-\ning history (Fig. 3a), which equalled to an odds\nratio (OR) of 5.5 and a signiﬁcant P-value of\n7.3 × 10−8 (Fig. 3b). This ﬁnding suggested that\ntobacco smoking history conferred a signiﬁcant\nrisk for getting severe COVID-19, once infected by\nthe underlying coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. To vali-\ndate this ﬁnding, we conducted a meta-analysis by\ncombining this cohort with nine published cohorts\nthose contained patients with smoking history. The\nresult of this meta-analysis was an OR of 2.5 and a\nP-value of < 0.00001 (Fig. 3c,d), supporting the\nassociation ﬁnding from this focused study.

In this cohort, 194\npatients each had 1–7 computerized tomography\n(CT) chest scans, including 150 nonsmokers and\n44 smokers, collecting a total of 394 images (384\nfor nonsmokers and 110 for smokers). To quanti-\ntatively analyse the lung damage, we gave a score\n(0–5, 0 for no damage and 5 for> 75% damage) for\neach of the ﬁve lobes, plus scoring for 15 additional\nfeatures (see Methods). A total of 10,574 scores\nwere ‘blindly’ collected for the 194 patients. We ﬁrst\nlooked at the mean score for each of the ﬁve lobes\nbased on each patient’s ﬁrst CT scan because these\nrepresented the overall lung health around initial\nsigniﬁcant clinical manifestations. As a result, the\nbilateral low lobes had higher scores than other\nlobes, and by group comparison, the smokers had\nconsistent higher scores than the nonsmokers\nbased on two-way ANOVA statistics, but not by\nt-tests for any of the lobes or for the summed score\nof\nﬁve\nlobes\n(Fig. 4a,b).\nThe\nnegative\nresults\nremained when males only were considered (data\nnot shown). At a detailed level, the ﬁrst CT scans\ndid reveal a signiﬁcant difference amongst 20\nsingle features: air bronchogram score was higher\non average in the smoking group than in the\nnonsmoking group (0.43 vs 0.19: PT = 0.0012).\nTo consider disease stage of the CT scans, summed\nscores\nwere\ndisplayed\nbased\non\nillness\ndays\n(iDays). This display showed that within three\nweeks of onset, the scores increased, as the infec-\ntion progressed, and the slope was similar between\nthe two groups (Fig. 4c).

An advan-\ntage of this single-site clinical investigation was the\nsame unbiased and deﬁned measures applied to all\nconﬁrmed patients, which is critical for a reliable\nresult [24]. However, despite same standards used,\nextensive and intensive imaging analyses failed to\nﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in lung health between\nthe smoking and nonsmoking groups. This nega-\ntive ﬁnding was surprising, suggesting that SARS-\nCoV-2 infection ‘overwrite’ any effect of smoking on\nthe lungs probably because the lungs bear the\nbrunt of the infection.\nOur smoking-focused study ﬁnds a large and pos-\nitive effect size of smoking history for disease sever-\nity, by utilizing standardized questionnaire and\nclear criteria for smoking history and disease stages.\nWith different results, other epidemiology reports on\nsmoking effects might have study design issues of\ninconsistency, including focus on ‘current’ smokers\nonly, patients without hospitalization outcomes yet,\nlack of a criterium for smoking history or ‘survivors’,\nas have been recognized [24]. Few meta-analyses\nwiththosereportshavebeenreportedbuttheresults\ncould be spurious if the individual studies used\ndidn’t have a clean, standardized design. These\ninconsistencies in study design may explain why\nresults\nfrom\nthe\nreported\nmeta-analyses\nare\nheterogenous: smaller ORs, lack of association or\neven recognizing smoking as a protective factor [5,\n8]. For the same reason, our meta-analysis didn’t\nrepresent the most reliable or comprehensive either\nalthough we carefully selected the nine studies\nbased on their clinical descriptions. In addition,\nour results, like others [8], didn’t ﬁnd a statistically\nsigniﬁcant association with mortality, suggesting\nthat smoking itself be not a critical determinant of\nmortality in this disease but this suggestive ﬁnding\nwill need more cases to evaluate.\nSmoking history has little effect on coronaviral\ninfection of the lungs. We chose to include cases\nwith both current and past smoking history because\nthe effects are postulated to be accumulative [9, 10].\nDespite the accumulation, little effects were found\non\nthe\nlungs\nbased\non\n20\ndifferent\ndamage\nmeasures.\nPrevious\nstudies\nhave\nshown\nthat\nemphysema is the key result of the smoking lung\n[25, 26]. Emphysema can also be a result of coron-\naviralinfectionofthelungs[27-29].ManyCOVID-19\npatients are often infected with germs causing\npneumonia – and that this in turn can lead to lung\ndamage of the emphysema type. These ﬁndings\nsuggest that the later result ‘overwrite’ the former\nresult, which may explain the lack of difference in\nlung damage between the two groups. Besides, air\nbronchogramcan alsobe aresultof theinfection [23,\n30] and our ﬁnding suggests that smoking history\nmay facilitate the formation of air bronchogram in\nlungs with COVID-19.\nWhere did the smoking risk come from? Our study\nfailed to ﬁnd a solid answer with the negative results in\nlung damage. One explanation is that COVID-19\nseverity is not determined by the lung damage alone,\ngiven the fact that COVID-19 is a multiorgan damage\ndisease, possibly due to systemic immune overreaction\n[31, 32]. Our laboratory results on density of immune\ncells uncover for the ﬁrst time signiﬁcant difference in\ncovariance between the two groups and this ﬁnding\nmay indicate an effect of smoking history on the\nimmune system instead. This rationale is consistent\nwith the view that smoking history suppresses the\nimmune system to confer the risk [33]. This view also\nexplains the smoking-associated systemic and slight\nincrease in the damage scores from the ﬁrst scans\n(Fig. 4a) but not necessarily in the right lung although\nCOVID-19 affects the right lung preferentially [34].\nPrevalence of smoking is low amongst patients with\nCOVID-19. More than 25% of the Chinese popula-\ntion are exposed to tobacco smoking [35, 36]. In\nthis cohort, the prevalence is only less than 6% in\nthe\npatients,\nconsistent\nwith\nwhat\nhas\nbeen\nreported for 5960 different patients [37], suggest-\ning that our cohort was representative of COVID-19\npatients. One explanation is that smokers usually\nkeep social distancing, which is effective to mini-\nmize the smell and smoke exposure in the public\n[38]. This ‘natural’ social habit may have helped\nand reduced the coronavirus transmission to the\nsmokers, resulting in the low prevalence. This low\nprevalence, on the other hand, has made it more\nchallenging to study smoking effects on COVID-19\nin an unbiased manner and large cohorts.\nLimitations of this retrospective study included\nlimited sample size, especially for the smoking\ngroup, limited ethnicity and incomplete collection\nof CT images. This was a clinical association\nTobacco smoking & severe COVID-19\n/ J. Li et al.\nª 2020 The Authors.

Gender was not controlled in all analyses\nsince most of smokers were males. A control for\nreceptor expression levels was not considered for\ndisease severity. Nicotine-related vascular dynam-\nics was not followed up yet. The large OR obtained\nin this cohort thus needs replication by additional\nwell-designed studies in larger cohort and different\nethnicities.\nConclusion\nTobacco smoking confers a signiﬁcant risk for\nsevere COVID-19 which leads to ICU necessity or\ndeath. However, it is unlikely the lung that medi-\nates the risk. Rather, the great severity may more\nlikely be a result of immune suppression by\naccumulated smoking.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank all patients for participating in this\nstudy.\nConﬂict of interest\nNone of the authors declare conﬂict of interest.\nAuthor contribution\nZhicheng Lin and Nian Xiong conceived the study\nfor different sections (contributors): smoking vs\nnonsmoking grouping (Jingwen Li, Nian Xiong),\niDay, hDay information collection, veriﬁcation,\nsmoking epidemiology and smoking amount data\n(Qing Zhang, Na Li, Xi Fang), laboratory results\nand other data retrieving or statistical t-tests\nanalysis (Qing Zhang, Xi Fang, Jingwen Li, Nian\nXiong), CT scan: imaging collection, analysis,\nscoring and data sheet preparation (Xi Long,\nShaoping Hu, Nian Xiong), CT imaging methods\nsection drafting (Jingwen Li, Xi Long, Shaoping\nHu, Nian Xiong), CT image selection and prepara-\ntion for a smoker and a nonsmoker (Xi Long,\nShaoping Hu, Nian Xiong), other data analyses\nand\nmanuscript\ndrafting\n(Zhicheng\nLin);\nand\nmanuscript\nﬁnalization\n(Zhicheng\nLin,\nNian\nXiong, Jinghong Li, Barbara Fedorova).

Levy, PhD,2,3,4 Nancy A. Rigotti, MD1,2,3,4\nIntroduction: With concerns about tobacco use being a risk factor for severe disease from COVID-\n19, understanding nicotine- and tobacco-use patterns is important for preventive efforts. This study\naims to understand changes in combustible cigarette and E-cigarette use among U.S. adults.\nMethods: In August 2020, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of adults aged\n≥18 years in the National Opinion Research Center’s AmeriSpeak Panel who reported past 6−month\nuse of combustible cigarettes or E-cigarettes was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the\nfactors associated with increased product use and quit attempts since hearing about COVID-19.\nResults: A total of 1,024 past 6−month cigarette smokers/E-cigarette users were surveyed. Among\ncigarette smokers, 45% reported no change in cigarette smoking, and 33% reported increased cigarette\nsmoking since hearing about COVID-19. Higher stress was associated with increased cigarette smok-\ning. Among E-cigarette users, 41% reported no change in E-cigarette use, and 23% reported increasing\nE-cigarette use. A total of 26% of cigarette smokers and 41% of E-cigarette users tried to quit because\nof COVID-19. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit combustible\ncigarettes (AOR=2.37, 95% CI=1.59, 3.55) and E-cigarettes (AOR=3.14, 95% CI=1.73, 5.70).\nConclusions: Cigarette and E-cigarette use patterns varied in response to the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic. Most cigarette smokers and E-cigarette users perceived product use as increasing COVID-\n19‒related health risks, and this was associated with attempts to quit. Some cigarette smokers,\nespecially those reporting higher stress, increased product use. Proactive provision of cessation\nsupport to smokers and E-cigarette users may help mitigate the stress-related increases in product\nuse during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAm J Prev Med 2022;62(3):341−349. © 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Data on the association\nbetween E-cigarette use and COVID-19 outcomes are\nlacking, although there has been some concern about E-\ncigarette use being associated with increased COVID-19\nrisk among young people.9\nMany smokers turn to cigarettes when they are\nstressed. Stressful life events have been negatively associ-\nated with quitting smoking,10 and perceived stress has\nbeen associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms.11\nTherefore, some smokers and E-cigarette users may\nFrom the 1From the Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of\nMedicine,\nMassachusetts\nGeneral\nHospital,\nBoston,\nMassachusetts;\n2Tobacco Research & Treatment Center, Massachusetts General Hospital,\nBoston, Massachusetts; 3The Mongan Institute, Massachusetts General\nHospital, Boston, Massachusetts; and 4Department of Medicine, Harvard\nMedical School, Boston, Massachusetts\nAddress correspondence to: Nancy A.

At the same time, other smokers might\ndecrease their tobacco use because they have chronic\nheart or lung disease that they perceive puts them at a\nhigher risk of negative outcomes from COVID-19 or\nbecause they have trouble obtaining or using their nor-\nmal products during business closures or shelter-in-\nplace orders. Thus, because the COVID-19 pandemic\ncould have either positive or negative impacts on nico-\ntine and tobacco product use, studies are urgently\nneeded to understand changes in product use among\npeople who smoke cigarettes or use E-cigarettes during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of dual users of ciga-\nrettes and E-cigarettes in the U.S. done early in the pan-\ndemic found that between 20% and 25% of participants\nhad tried to quit cigarettes or E-cigarettes to reduce\nharm from COVID-19.12 By contrast, approximately\n30% reported increasing the use of cigarettes and E-ciga-\nrettes. More recent data from larger, nationally represen-\ntative groups of smokers and E-cigarette users are\nneeded to further understand these use patterns.\nA better understanding of smokers’ and E-cigarette\nusers’ behaviors and attitudes is important for designing\ntargeted outreach and education for this population.\nThis cross-sectional survey of combustible cigarette\nsmokers and E-cigarette users from a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of U.S. adults aims to assess (1) the\nchanges in product use because of COVID-19, (2) the\nfactors associated with increased product use, and (3)\nthe factors associated with product-quit attempts.\nMETHODS\nStudy Sample\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted among a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of adults in the National Opinion Research Cen-\nter’s AmeriSpeak Panel.13 For the Amerispeak Panel, U.S.\nhouseholds are sampled using probability- and address-based\nsampling methods to cover approximately 97% of the U.S. house-\nhold population. Sampled households are contacted for potential\nparticipation in the Amerispeak Panel by mail, telephone, and\nﬁeld interviews, and participants provide informed consent at the\ntime of registration. Most panel members participate in surveys\nonline; households without Internet connections can take surveys\nby telephone. Panel members participate in surveys approximately\n2−3 times a month.\nFor this study, eligibility criteria included age ≥18 years,\nEnglish speaking, and use of either combustible cigarettes or elec-\ntronic nicotine products/E-cigarettes since February 2020 (i.e., past\n6−month use). This date was chosen to capture individuals who\nmay have quit cigarette smoking or E-cigarette use just before the\npandemic to assess for potential relapse during the pandemic. A\nscreening questionnaire was used to identify past 6−month ciga-\nrette and E-cigarette users. E-cigarette users and dual users were\nsampled separately from cigarette-only users to obtain adequate\nsample sizes for questions related to E-cigarette use; a quota was\nset to sample approximately 500 E-cigarette users/dual users and\n500 exclusive cigarette smokers. Dual users were not sampled sep-\narately because the goal was to evaluate changes in both cigarette\nand E-cigarette use among users of each of the 2 products rather\nthan to compare these groups. Only deidentiﬁed data were\nobtained from the National Opinion Research Center, and this\nstudy was deemed exempt by the IRB at Mass General Brigham.\nSurveys were conducted from August 20, 2020 to August 25, 2020.\nMeasures\nParticipants reporting past 6−month cigarette or E-cigarette use\nwere asked whether they currently used the products every day,\nsome days, or not at all and how long they had been using the\nproducts. Current product use was deﬁned as current everyday or\nsomeday use. Dual use was deﬁned as the use of both cigarettes\nand E-cigarettes in the past 6 months. Sociodemographic\nfactors included age, sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, and\nregion of residence.\nWith respect to COVID-19 and change in product use, past 6\n−month cigarette smokers were asked: Since hearing about the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19), would you say the amount you are smok-\ning has. . . Answer choices were: (1) increased a lot, (2) increased a\nlittle, (3) stayed about the same, (4) decreased a little, or (5)\ndecreased a lot. For regression models, this was dichotomized into\nincreased and not increased. Current cigarette smokers reported\nwhether hearing about COVID-19 affected their interest in reduc-\ning or stopping smoking (yes, less interested; yes, more interested;\nor no, not affected) and whether hearing about COVID-19 has led\nthem to try to stop smoking (yes/no). Trying to quit smoking was\ndeﬁned as reporting (1) that COVID-19 led them to try to stop\nsmoking or (2) that they had completely stopped smoking since\nhearing about COVID-19. Past 6−month E-cigarette users were\nasked the same questions about the use of E-cigarettes, and dual\nusers of cigarettes and E-cigarettes were asked these questions\nabout both products.\nPast 6−month cigarette smokers were asked their opinion\nabout smoking and their risk of getting COVID-19 or having a\nmore serious case in any way (smoking deﬁnitely increases my risk,\nsmoking might increase my risk, smoking does not affect my risk,\nsmoking might decrease my risk, smoking deﬁnitely decreases my\nrisk). Past 6−month E-cigarette users were asked the same ques-\ntion about E-cigarette use and COVID-19 risk.\nAll participants were asked whether they had been tested for\nCOVID-19 or told by a medical professional that they were\ninfected with COVID-19. Potential stressors were assessed by ask-\ning participants about whether COVID-19 changed how much\ntime they spend working and how much they worry about having\nﬁnancial problems because of the COVID-19 pandemic (on a 5-\npoint scale from not at all to very much). Participants also com-\npleted the Perceived Stress Scale 4,14 which is scored from 0 to 16,\nwith higher levels indicating higher stress. This scale is not speciﬁc\nto COVID-19 but was asked of participants during the COVID-19\npandemic.\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, cigarette and E-cigarette use behaviors and perceived risks\nrelated to COVID-19 were described. Then, univariable logistic\nregression analyses were conducted to assess the predictors of (1)\n342\nKalkhoran et al / Am J Prev Med 2022;62(3):341−349\nwww.ajpmonline.org\nincreased cigarette smoking or E-cigarette use because of COVID-\n19, (2) trying to quit cigarette smoking or E-cigarette use, or (3)\nincreased interest in reducing or stopping cigarette smoking or E-\ncigarette use among participants who were still using the products\nat the time of the survey. Variables with p<0.15 in univariable\nanalyses were included in multivariable logistic regression models\nwith sociodemographic characteristics and cigarette or E-cigarette\nuse. Only participants with complete data on study variables were\nincluded in the multivariable models. All analyses were adjusted\nfor complex survey procedures and sample weights using Stata,\nversion 13. Sample weights are adjusted for nonresponse and are\nraked to population controls derived from the Current Population\nSurvey. All n are reported as unweighted, and all percentages are\nweighted.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 4,734 of the 20,455 (23.1%) invited Amerispeak\nPanel members completed the screening questionnaire.\nOf these individuals, 678 (14.3%) reported either E-ciga-\nrette use or dual use of E-cigarettes and cigarettes in the\npast 6 months, and 549 (11.6%) reported cigarette smok-\ning only during this time and were therefore eligible for\nthe survey. Among those eligible, 507 (74.7%) of the E-\ncigarette or dual users and 517 (94.3%) of the cigarette\nsmokers completed the survey. Among those in the E-\ncigarette sample, 336 reported using E-cigarettes only,\nand 171 reported both smoking cigarettes and using E-\ncigarettes. The characteristics of the study population by\npast 6−month use of cigarettes and E-cigarettes are\nshown in Table 1.\nAmong cigarette smokers who had smoked since\nhearing about COVID-19 (n=601), 45% reported no\nchange in cigarette smoking, 21% reported decreased\ncigarette smoking, and 33% reported increased cigarette\nsmoking (Figure 1A). These proportions did not differ\nsigniﬁcantly between cigarette-only smokers and dual\nusers (p=0.30, data not shown in tables). Among past 6\n−month cigarette smokers who reported quitting before\nthe COVID-19 pandemic (n=85), 15% reported relaps-\ning back to cigarette smoking. In multivariable analyses,\nfactors associated with increased cigarette smoking\namong participants who had smoked since hearing\nabout COVID-19 were higher perceived stress, greater\nworry about ﬁnancial problems because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, and working more during the pandemic\n(Table 2).\nAmong E-cigarette users who had used E-cigarettes\nsince hearing about COVID-19 (n=384), 41% reported\nno change in use, 37% reported decreased use, and 23%\nreported increased use (Figure 1B). E-cigarette‒only\nusers and dual users did not differ signiﬁcantly on this\nmeasure (p=0.85). Among past 6−month E-cigarette\nusers who reported quitting before the COVID-19\npandemic (n=113), most (82%) reported staying quit,\nwhereas 18% reported relapsing back to E-cigarette use.\nIn multivariable analyses, increased E-cigarette use since\nhearing about COVID-19 was associated with female sex\nand was negatively associated with residing in the Mid-\nwest or South (versus in the Northeast), but associations\nwith COVID-19 factors (ﬁnancial stress, work hours,\nCOVID-19 risk) were not signiﬁcant (Table 2).\nMost (63%) past 6−month cigarette smokers per-\nceived that cigarette use might increase or deﬁnitely\nincreases their risk of contracting COVID-19 or having a\nmore serious outcome, whereas 32% did not think that\ncigarette smoking affected their risk (Appendix Figure 1,\navailable online). Perceived risk of COVID-19 did not\ndiffer signiﬁcantly between cigarette-only smokers and\ndual users (p=0.22, data not shown in tables). Similarly,\nmost (59%) past 6−month E-cigarette users reported\nfeeling that E-cigarette use might increase or deﬁnitely\nincreases their risk of COVID-19 or a more serious out-\ncome, whereas one third (33%) did not think that E-cig-\narette use affected their risk (Appendix Figure 1,\navailable online). E-cigarette‒only users and dual users\ndid not differ signiﬁcantly in perceived risk of COVID-\n19 (p=0.89).\nAmong participants who had smoked cigarettes since\nhearing about COVID-19, 26% reported trying to quit\nbecause of COVID-19. Dual users did not differ signiﬁ-\ncantly from cigarette-only users in trying to quit\n(p=0.07). The belief that smoking increases the risk of\nCOVID-19 or having a more severe case was associated\nwith trying to quit cigarette smoking, and daily smoking\nand more years of cigarette smoking were negatively\nassociated with trying to quit (Table 3). Among partici-\npants who were still smoking at the time of the survey,\n35% reported increased interest in quitting smoking,\nand this did not differ signiﬁcantly between dual users\nand cigarette-only users (p=0.90). The belief that smok-\ning increases the risk of COVID-19 or having a more\nsevere case was associated with increased interest in\nquitting or reducing cigarette smoking (AOR=2.82, 95%\nCI=1.98, 4.02), whereas daily smoking was negatively\nassociated with increased interest in quitting or reducing\ncigarette smoking (AOR=0.35, 95% CI=0.19, 0.63).\nAmong participants who had used E-cigarettes since\nhearing about COVID-19, 41% reported trying to quit\nE-cigarettes because of COVID-19. Dual users did not\ndiffer signiﬁcantly from E-cigarette‒only users in trying\nto quit (p=0.11). The belief that E-cigarette use increases\nthe risk of COVID-19 or having a more severe case was\nassociated with trying to quit E-cigarettes, whereas daily\nE-cigarette use and past 6−month cigarette smoking\nwere negatively associated with trying to quit E-ciga-\nrettes (Table 3). Among participants who were still using\nKalkhoran et al / Am J Prev Med 2022;62(3):341−349\n343\nMarch 2022\nE-cigarettes at the time of the survey, 43% reported\nincreased interest in quitting E-cigarette use, and this\ndid not differ signiﬁcantly between dual users and E-cig-\narette‒only users (p=0.53). The belief that E-cigarette\nuse increases the risk of COVID-19 or having a more\nsevere case was associated with increased interest in\nquitting or reducing E-cigarette use (AOR=2.14, 95%\nCI=1.48, 3.09) as was working more during the pan-\ndemic (AOR=4.01, 95% CI=1.32, 12.21), whereas daily\nE-cigarette use was negatively associated with increased\nTable 1.

Approximately a third of cigarette\nsmokers and a quarter of E-cigarette users increased\ntheir product use during the pandemic, and personal\nand economic stressors were associated with increased\nuse among cigarette smokers. At the same time, 26% of\ncigarette smokers and 41% of E-cigarette users reported\ntrying to quit product use during the pandemic. Most\ncigarette smokers and E-cigarette users perceived their\nproduct use as increasing their risk of COVID-19 or a\nmore serious outcome. Higher perceived risk related to\nCOVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit both\ncigarettes and E-cigarettes, whereas daily product use\nwas negatively associated with quit attempts. The study\nﬁndings highlight the range of behavioral responses that\nusers of addictive products have had in response to an\nongoing pandemic.\nSimilar to previous studies, 33% of cigarette smokers\nand 23% of E-cigarette users increased their product\nuse.12,15 Previous studies have found that although some\nE-cigarette users had concerns about product access dur-\ning the COVID-19 pandemic, many were still able to\nobtain the products either by stockpiling of products, by\nonline purchasing, or from their usual channels either\nthrough vape shop noncompliance with or circumvent-\ning of business closure orders.16−18 In this study, the fac-\ntors associated with various forms of stress—total stress,\nworry about ﬁnancial problems, and increased working\nhours—were associated with increased cigarette smok-\ning during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study of current\nsmokers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19\npandemic also found an association between psychoso-\ncial and mental health factors and changes in cigarette\nconsumption.19 These data are consistent with ﬁndings\nfrom nonpandemic times in which high-stress levels\nhave been associated with continued cigarette smoking\nand the association between changes in perceived stress\nand changes in smoking status.20 Targeted outreach to\nsmokers during the pandemic to assist with stress\nmanagement and avoidance of smoking escalation can\nhelp to mitigate stress-related increases in smoking con-\nsumption. This can be facilitated by health systems’\nscreening for and addressing social determinants of\nhealth among all patients. Proactively offering cessation\nassistance outside of in-person healthcare visits may also\nhelp smokers to quit during the pandemic and can cap-\nture individuals who are hesitant to seek in-person care.\nPrevious work has shown the effectiveness of proactive\nsmoking-cessation support and referrals to community-\nbased resources in smokers with low SES.21 Cessation\nshould remain a key goal, particularly because tobacco\nuse continues to be the leading preventable cause of\ndeath worldwide.\nFigure 1.

A study in the United Kingdom\nfound higher odds of trying to quit and of quitting\namong past-year smokers after a COVID-19 lockdown,\nand although smokers were no more likely to use evi-\ndence-based\nsmoking-cessation\ntreatment\nafter\nthe\nlockdown, the use of remote smoking-cessation support\nin the form of telephone support, websites, or telephone\napplications increased during this time.22 Bolstering\naccess to tobacco-cessation resources that do not require\nin-person contact may be one way for smokers and\nE-cigarette users to act on their interest in quitting and\nsuccessfully quit. Eliminating copayments for smoking-\ncessation medications and the use of social media\nmarketing campaigns that also increase public awareness\nof resources such as national smoking quitlines can aid\nthese efforts. This is important because the use of\nsmoking quitlines decreased during the COVID-19\npandemic.23\nIn line with the present ﬁndings related to the per-\nceived risk of COVID-19 and attempts to quit, previous\nwork by Grummon et al.24 using a convenience sample\nof U.S. adults found that both messaging related to tradi-\ntional harms of smoking and those speciﬁcally related to\nCOVID-19 had higher perceived effectiveness for dis-\ncouraging smoking than control messages. By contrast,\nalthough messaging about traditional harms of E-ciga-\nrette use was associated with higher perceived effective-\nness for discouraging E-cigarette use than control, the\nsame was not seen for COVID-19‒related messages.\nThus, education of smokers on the relationship between\nsmoking and COVID-19 risk may serve as an important\nmotivator for cessation and reducing potential increases\nin product use. Further research is necessary to assess\nthe impacts of public health messaging on smoking and\nvaping during the pandemic and optimize messaging\ncontent for these individuals. In the meantime, clinicians\nand\npublic\nhealth\nofﬁcials\nshould\nemphasize\nthe\nincreased risk of COVID-19 for smokers in conversa-\ntions with patients and in public health messaging.\nLimitations\nThis study is subject to several limitations. First, data are\ncross-sectional, and therefore, longitudinal trends in cig-\narette and E-cigarette use could not be assessed. Second,\nall data are self-reported, including retrospective reports\nof use patterns, and therefore subject to errors in recall.\nThird, questions about risk perceptions combined\nperceived risk of getting COVID-19 and having a more\nserious case, so the answers to the individual compo-\nnents of this question cannot be ascertained. Finally,\ndata were collected at the end of August 2020, when\nCOVID-19 cases were lower than in Spring 2020 and\nFall 2020, and therefore, participant behaviors may not\nbe reﬂective of behaviors at other times during the pan-\ndemic.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis survey of a large nationally representative sample of\ncigarette smokers and E-cigarette users in the U.S.\nrevealed a range of product-use behaviors in response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, with some trying to quit prod-\nuct use and others increasing their product use. Most\ncigarette smokers and E-cigarette users perceived higher\nCOVID-19‒related health risks because of their product\nuse, factors that appeared to be associated with attempts\nto quit product use. Outreach to cigarette smokers and\nE-cigarette users to provide cessation assistance during\nthis time may help to support quit attempts and reduce\nstress-related increases in product use.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe funder of this study had no role in the design and conduct\nof the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpreta-\ntion of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manu-\nscript; or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nThis study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute of NIH (K23HL136854 to SK).\nSK and NAR received royalties from UpToDate, Inc.

As this new virus spreads, questions \ncontinue to emerge regarding risk factors. One widely \ndebated question is the potential effect of smoking \non severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \n2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates and on the clinical \noutcomes of the resulting disease, COVID-19. \nThere is well-established evidence that smokers \nare more susceptible to both viral and bacterial \nrespiratory infections1,2, as are those exposed to \nsecondhand smoke3. The World Health Organisation \n(WHO) has also highlighted smokers’ hand-to-mouth \naction, smoking-induced lung disease, and the sharing \nof tobacco products such as waterpipes, as factors \nwhich may increase a smoker’s vulnerability to SARS-\nCoV-2 infection and development of COVID-194. \nEvidence that chronic illnesses, especially respiratory \nand cardiovascular disease, are risk factors for worse \nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION There has been significant speculation regarding the association \nbetween the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) \npathogen, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and smoking. We provide an overview \nof the available literature regarding the association between smoking, risk of \nSARS-CoV-2 infection, and risk of severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcomes, \nwith the aim of informing public health policy and practice, particularly in \nEngland.\nMETHODS Publications were identified utilising a systematic search approach on \nPUBMED and Google Scholar. Publications presenting a systematic review or \nmeta-analysis considering the association between smoking and SARS-COV-2 \ninfection or COVID-19 outcomes were included.\nRESULTS Eight studies were identified. One considered the relationship between \nsmoking and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, three considered the \nassociation between COVID-19 hospitalisation and smoking history, and six \nreviewed the association between smoking history and development of severe \nCOVID-19. One study specifically investigated the risk of mortality. The studies \nconsidering risk of severe disease indicate that there is a significant association \nbetween COVID-19 and current or ever smoking.\nCONCLUSIONS This is a rapidly evolving topic. Current analysis remains limited due to \nthe quality of primary data, although, early results indicate an association between \nsmoking and COVID-19 severity. We highly recommend public health messaging \nto continue focusing on smoking cessation efforts.\nAFFILIATION\n1 Chelsea and Westminster \nHospital NHS Foundation \nTrust, London, United Kingdom\n2 Department of Paediatrics, \nImperial College Healthcare \nNHS Trust, London, United \nKingdom\n3 Department of Primary Care \nand Public Health, School \nof Public Health, Imperial \nCollege London, London, \nUnited Kingdom\n*Co-first authors\nCORRESPONDENCE TO\nSophie Coronini-Cronberg. \nChelsea and Westminster \nHospital NHS Foundation \nTrust, 369 Fulham Road, \nLondon SW10 9NH, United \nKingdom.

Smoking \ncontributes to the development of such long-term \nconditions2; conversely, it is reasonable to assume that \nsmoking may increase risks of COVID-19. Early in the \npandemic, it was argued that higher mortality among \nmales in China may reflect and be partly explained \nby the gender disparity in smoking prevalence7. \nNevertheless, smokers are not currently identified \nas a vulnerable group within the UK Government’s \nCOVID-19 guidance on social distancing8.\nThere may also be a specific mechanism through \nwhich exposure to tobacco smoke can influence \ninfection with SARS-CoV-2. Research following the \nemergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 identified a viral \nbinding site on the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 \nreceptor (ACE2R)9 and it appears SARS-CoV-2 not \nonly utilises ACE2R as its receptor, but may do so \nmore readily than SARS-CoV10,11. There are competing \ntheories regarding the effects of smoking on the level \nof ACER2 expression in cells of the human respiratory \ntract10,12,13. Given the role of ACER2 in enabling \nviral entry into human cells, any change in ACER2 \nexpression caused by exposure to tobacco smoke (and \npotentially other nicotine-containing products) may \nhave implications for an individual’s susceptibility to \ninfection. \nAn opposing theory to this has been proposed, \nwhereby the authors postulate that the nicotinic \nacetylcholine receptor (nACfR) acts as a co-receptor \nfor viral cell entry within the respiratory tract and \ncentral nervous system. It is suggested that nicotine \nmay compete with the SARS-COV-2 for the (nACfR) \nbinding site, hence leading to a reduction in available \nviral adhesion sites. There is, however, no empirical \nevidence to support this at this time14. \nEpidemiological evidence on the role of smoking \nin COVID-19 is emerging. Considering the wider \nimplications of tobacco control on population health \nand the healthcare system2,15, it is crucial to optimise \npolicies influencing tobacco use during the pandemic. \nTherefore, we set out to review the findings of existing \nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding the \nassociation between smoking and risk of contracting \nSARS-CoV-2 and of developing severe outcomes once \ninfected, with the intention of informing public health \npolicy, with a particular focus on the public health \nsystem in England. \nMETHODS \nA search for existing systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses published between 1 January and 8 May \n2020 was undertaken on PubMed, utilising the search \nterms: ‘Smoking’, ‘Nicotine’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-\nCoV-2’, and ‘Coronavirus’, in pairwise combinations. \nThis was supplemented with an article title search \non Google Scholar utilising the same terminology, \nwithout restriction on study type, from which meta-\nanalyses and systematic reviews were extracted \nmanually. Two independent researchers screened \nthe publications for eligibility. Only publications in \nthe English language were considered. Our method \nis explained schematically in Figure 1. In an effort to \nconsider the most up-to-date evidence-base, eligible \nstudies were checked for updates at the point of \nmanuscript revision. The findings from the most \nrecent versions of each study have been considered. \nRESULTS\nOn reviewing a total of 44 publications, eight studies \nsuitable for inclusion were identified16-23, which \nformed the basis of our review (Figure 1). At the \ntime of writing, three of these eight studies were \nfound to have been updated, or formally published \nafter initially being made available on pre-print \nplatforms16,18,22.\nSmoking as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection\nAcross the eight selected studies, there were very \nlimited data regarding the relationship between \nsmoking history and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nSimons et al.18 reviewed 13 studies, using the results \nfrom seven of those studies that they deemed ‘fair \nquality’ to perform a meta-analysis. The results showed \nthat current smokers were at reduced risk of testing \npositive for COVID-19 compared to never smokers \n(risk ratio, RR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.73–0.99). There \nwas no significant difference in the risk of testing \npositive between former smokers and never smokers \n(RR=1.02; 95% CI: 0.88–1.18). Heterogeneity was \nvery high in both meta-analyses (I2=93% and I2=84%, \nrespectively).\nSmoking and COVID-19 outcomes\nIn considering the relationship between smoking and \nCOVID-19 outcomes, the eight studies included in \nReview Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):58\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/124788\n3\nour review took two general approaches: \n1. Using data presented in literature to produce \npooled smoking prevalence estimates amongst \nhospitalised patients (hospitalisation being a \nreasonable proxy for moderate or severe disease)16-18; \n2. Directly comparing rates of various clinical \noutcomes among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, \naccording to their smoking history (which is variably \ndefined between studies)18-23. \nSmoking prevalence among hospitalised patients\nThree meta-analyses considered hospital admission \nfor COVID-19 and smoking. Two produced pooled \nestimates of smoking prevalence amongst smokers \nadmitted to hospital with COVID-1916,17, whilst the \nthird assessed the risk of hospital admission between \nsmokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers18. \nUsing data for 5960 patients across 13 studies \nin China, Farsalinos et al.16 found a pooled current \nsmoking prevalence estimate of 6.5% (95% CI: 4.9–\n8.2%) among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, which \nwas lower than the estimated prevalence within \nthe general population of the country. A secondary \nanalysis designed to address possible misclassification \nof very recently quit smokers found a pooled estimate \nof ever smokers of 7.3% (95% CI: 5.7–8.9%). Emami \net al.17 found a similar pooled estimate of smoking \nhistory of 7.63% [95% CI: 3.83–12.43%) based on \na smaller sample of 2986 patients derived from six \nheterogeneous studies from China (I2=90.19%). \nSimons et al.18 conducted a rapid review attempting to \nanswer several questions from the available literature. \nThey performed a meta-analysis using five studies \ndeemed ‘fair quality’, showing no difference in either \nFigure 1.

These are described in chronological \norder of initial publication. Across these studies, \nthe use of the term ‘severe disease’ (also referred \nto as ‘critical disease’ or ‘disease progression’) \nwas not consistently defined. Three of the studies \nacknowledged the variability of outcome measures \nused across the available primary research included \nwithin their pooled estimates18,21,22, but only two \nexplicitly included detail of how they had defined \n‘severe’ disease in the context of their data extraction \nprocess and analysis18,21. While the Chinese National \nHealth Committee’s definition of severe COVID-19 \n(‘respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥30/min or \noxygen saturation ≤93% at rest or oxygenation index \n≤300 mmHg’)22 was used by some of the primary \nresearch studies as their outcome of interest, other \nmarkers, including ICU admission and mechanical \nventilation, or death were also used. \nLippi and Henry19 identified five studies from \nChina, incorporating 1399 COVID-19 patients, 288 \nof whom were identified as having ‘severe disease’. \nOne included study found active smoking to be a \nsignificant predictor of COVID-19 severity24, but the \nother four studies showed non-significant results. \nThe pooled odds ratio for the 5 studies was found to \nbe 1.69 (95% CI: 0.41–6.92), although this analysis \nhas been heavily criticised for inclusion of erroneous \ndata25. \nVardavas and Nikitara20 reviewed outcomes of \nSARS-CoV-2 in five Chinese studies. In three of the \nstudies reviewed, no significant association could \nbe established between smoking and outcomes by \nthe authors. Results from one study24 indicated that \nsmoking was significantly associated with disease \nprogression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58–25.00; \np=0.018). Analysis by Vardavas and Nikitara20 using \nraw data published by Guan et al.26, concluded that \nsmokers were more likely to experience severe \nsymptoms (RR=1.40; 95% CI: 0.98–2.00), and 2.4 \ntimes more likely to require ICU admission (RR=2.40; \n95% CI: 1.43–4.04). \nThe meta-analysis of Zhao et al.21 investigated \nthe risk of development of ‘severe COVID-19’ in \nCOPD patients and current smokers. They included \n11 studies with a total of 2002 patients from China. \nSeven of these studies reported smoking history \n(n=1726). The pooled results showed an association \nbetween current smoking and development of severe \nCOVID-19 (OR=1.98; 95% CI: 1.29–3.05). Zhao et \nal.21 reported moderate study heterogeneity (I2=44%; \np=0.10). The association between smoking and \ndevelopment of severe COVID-19 was significant \nwhen all seven studies were included, however, upon \nremoval of the most heavily-weighted study26, which \nhad been found to be a source of heterogeneity, the \nresults were non-significant (OR=1.55; 95% CI: 0.83–\n2.87). An updated version of this meta-analysis27, \nwhich included one additional study, showed a \nstronger association between current smoking and \nsevere disease (OR=2.16; 95% CI: 1.45–3.22), and \na reduction in study heterogeneity (I2=39%). This \nresult remained significant on the removal of the most \nheavily-weighted study26 from the analyses (OR=1.89; \n95% CI: 1.10–3.24)27. \nPatanavanich and Glantz22 published a meta-analysis \nof 19 studies with their main outcome measure defined \nas progression of COVID-19 among hospitalised \npatients. The data analysed included a total of 11590 \npatients, of which 2133 developed severe disease; \n731 patients included were ever smokers. They found \nthat disease progression was observed in 29.8% of \never smokers compared with 17.6% of never smokers \n(OR=1.91; 95% CI: 1.42–2.59). They reported \nmoderate heterogeneity (I2=38%; p=0.048), and \nno significant publication bias (Harbord’s p=0.813; \nPeters’ p=0.941). Subsequent sensitivity analysis \nusing five of the 19 studies also found a significant \nassociation between current smoking and risk of \ndisease progression compared to never smoking \n(OR=1.91; 95% CI: 1.10–3.29; p=0.021), with no \nevidence of significant heterogeneity or publication \nbias.\nZheng et al.23 included five studies from China \nin their meta-analysis, incorporating data of 1980 \npatients of whom 268 experienced critical or fatal \nevents. The authors reported a significant association \nbetween current smoking and disease progression \namongst patients with COVID-19 (OR=2.04; 95% CI: \nReview Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):58\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/124788\n5\n1.32–3.15). The authors reported no heterogeneity \n(I2=0%).\nSimons et al.18 reviewed 33 studies investigating \nthe association between disease severity and smoking \nstatus. They performed a meta-analysis of four selected \n‘fair quality’ studies, showing that current smokers \nwere more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness \ncompared to never smokers (RR=1.39; 95% CI: \n1.09–1.77). No significant difference was observed \nbetween former and never smokers (RR=1.40; 95% \nCI: 0.76–2.59). Simons et al.18 treated mortality as \na separate measure in their analysis, reviewing 17 \nstudies, and conducting a meta-analysis using two \nstudies deemed ‘fair quality’. These analyses found \nno significant difference between the risk of death \nfrom COVID-19 either between current and never \nsmokers (RR=1.41; 95% CI: 0.91–2.20), or former \nand never smokers (RR=0.98; 95% CI: 0.65–1.48). \nThere is some significant overlap between the \nstudies used for the eight systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses considering: a) smoking prevalence amongst \nhospitalised patients, b) risk of hospitalisation, c) risk \nof disease progression, and d) risk of death (Table 1). \nThe total number (n) of included participants in each \nprimary study is also indicated. It should be noted that \nsmoking status was not necessarily available for all \nparticipants, and as such, a subset of the total dataset \nmay have been used to inform the authors’ analysis, \nand this subset may have varied between the eight \nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses.\nTable 1.

We found limited evidence suggesting \nthat the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be lower \namong smokers compared to non-smokers, albeit from \nhighly heterogeneous studies. By contrast, however, \nthere is growing evidence regarding the association \nbetween smoking status and COVID-19 severity and \npoor clinical outcomes, with an increasing number \nof published primary research papers making larger, \npooled sample sizes possible.\nThe studies considering risk of severe disease \nindicate that there is a significant association between \nCOVID-19 and current or ever smoking. The meta-\nanalysis by Patanavanich and Glantz22, which included \nthe largest pooled sample size to date, suggests an \nincreased risk of severe COVID-19 amongst ever \nsmokers. While these are important findings, they \nmust be considered in light of the limitations of the \nprimary research. \nOther descriptive reviews have acknowledged \nthe contrasting findings presented by Vardavas and \nNikitara20 and Lippi and Henry19 and concluded \nthat early data from China did not provide clear \nevidence of an association between smoking and \npoorer COVID-197,28,29 outcomes. However, the \nmethodological soundness of the meta-analysis \nby Lippi and Henry19 has been challenged25,30. \nThese criticisms include both the use of incorrect \ndata in meta-analyses25 and the incorrect use of \nnull hypothesis significance testing, leading to an \nincorrect conclusion regarding the absence of effect30. \nA repeat analysis by Guo25 using the correct data \nTable 1.

Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):58\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/124788\n7\nfrom the studies considered by Lippi and Henry19 \nfound a significant association between active \nsmoking and severe COVID-19 (OR=2.20; 95% \nCI: 1.31–3.67), supporting the view of Cattaruzza \net al.7 that despite the uncertainty around data on \nthe association between smoking and COVID-19, \nsmoking may represent ‘the most important avoidable \nrisk factor’. Our paper reviewed a significant amount \nof the available literature, and hence provides a \ncomprehensive overview of the current evidence-\nbase. It is, to our knowledge, one of the first review \nof reviews considering the association between SARS-\nCOV-2, COVID-19 and smoking. \nStrengths and limitations \nThere are several limitations associated with the \nprimary research used to inform the eight systematic \nreviews and meta-analyses considered within this \nreport. Most of the primary research considered is \nbased on data derived from small convenient hospital \nsamples that are unlikely to be representative of the \ngeneral population and will under-represent those \npopulations that are unable or less likely to access \nhealthcare. \nFurthermore, analysis of those, by definition, non-\nrandom samples raises significant risks of selection or \ncollider bias through various pathways. For example, \nhospitalisation may be influenced both by smoking \nand COVID-19 severity. Studying hospitalised \npatients may lead to spurious or mask true associations \nbetween smoking and COVID-19 outcomes31. \nSimilarly, ex-smokers are also likely to have smoking-\nrelated conditions such as cardiovascular illness and \npulmonary pathology2 making them more vulnerable \nto severe COVID-1932. These smoking-related \nconditions may in fact be the reason why patients \nsmoke less or quit. Thus, studies investigating current \nsmoking may be subject to selection bias. Investigating \nthe effect of being an ever smoker is less vulnerable to \nselection bias, though cannot address any hypotheses \nregarding the direct impact of current nicotine use \non disease progression14. Some of these issues can be \npartly addressed with cohort study designs. Two such \nstudies have been conducted in the UK33,34 and have \nfound increased risks of hospitalisation and death \namong current and former smokers. Nevertheless, \nthey also have major limitations, including lack of \nrecent data on smoking status33 and unstable estimates \nin sensitivity analyses34.\nThe primary studies included in the reviews we \nassessed reported smoking history and outcomes \ninconsistently. Most studies do not define what is \nmeant by ‘smoking’, and the definitions of current and \nformer smoker are likely to vary. Some report ‘daily \nsmokers’, while others may define former smoker \ndifferently, as the duration of abstinence is not clearly \nstandardised. If investigating a correlation between \nnicotine and COVID-19, reporting of additional \nnicotine ingestion methods such as vaping, hookah \nand chewing tobacco should be considered. Definition \nof ‘severe’ outcomes also varied – often composite \nmeasures were used by the meta-analyses to produce \na statistically viable sample size. \nRecording of smoking status on which many \nprimary studies are based will be of variable quality, \nparticularly at a time when clinical coding may not be \na priority. The smoking rates reported are consistently \nlower than the population averages18. However, this \nshould be interpreted with caution because of likely \nselection bias, but also because smoking prevalence \nmay be substantially underreported leading to \nmisclassification. Several steps in the data acquisition \nprocess are prone to systematic error including self-\nreporting of smoking status, especially at a time when \nhealthcare facilities are under pressure and no next-\nof-kin may be present to provide further information. \nSmoking data in health records is often incomplete \nor inconsistent35,36. It is also very challenging to \ndetermine how much data may be missing when \nderiving data from existing datasets and how missing \ndata were treated in each study.\nAlthough most studies referenced by the assessed \nreviews and meta-analyses are from China, not all \nare, and this presents another difficulty in comparing \ndatasets across different countries and in assessing \ngeneralisability of findings. \nMost of the reviews examined utilise data on \nhospitalised COVID-19 patients. Given that most \nSARS-CoV-2 infections do not result in medical \nintervention37, the wider picture of the infection \npyramid also requires consideration to determine \nthe full picture of how smoking impacts on SARS-\nCoV-2 infection. Simons et al.38 attempted to address \nthis; however, the primary studies available to inform \ntheir review were highly heterogeneous, which may \ndecrease the reliability of the pooled estimates. \nReview Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):58\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/124788\n8\nImplications for policy and practice\nWe have reviewed the available international literature \nconsidering the association between SARS-CoV-2, \nCOVID-19 and smoking in order to inform public \nhealth policy and practice, particularly in England. \nAlthough current evidence relating to smoking and \nCOVID-19 is not conclusive, this should not preclude \nproactive efforts by public health systems to promote \nsmoking prevention initiatives among never smokers, \nas well as to identify, advise and engage smokers in \ncessation attempts. \nRegardless of any impacts on SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection rates and COVID-19 outcomes, smoking \ncessation offers a range of benefits, both during the \ncurrent pandemic and beyond. An obvious example \nis the reduction in incidence of smoking-related \ndiseases, such as myocardial infarction39. Similarly, \nlower exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to \nrapid reductions in hospital admissions for asthma \nexacerbations amongst children40 and hospitalisation \nfor myocardial infarction41. This latter point is \nparticularly pertinent at this time given the UK \nGovernment’s social distancing guidance8, which has \nrequired people to remain at home for many weeks, \npotentially changing their smoking practices and \nleading to an increase in indoor smoking. Delivering \nthese kinds of health improvements in the immediate- \nto short-term would not only impact on morbidity and \nmortality rates, but also contribute to a reduction in \nassociated spells of primary, secondary and emergency \ncare during a time in which the NHS is under \nunprecedented pressure. \nThe personal financial savings realised as a result \nof smoking cessation are also significant, particularly \nfor those from deprived communities. Individuals \nfrom lower socioeconomic groups are more likely \nto smoke42, and to face increased financial hardship \nresulting from the impact of lockdown measures and \nthe long-term economic effects. \nSurvey data suggest that smoking behaviours in \nEngland may already have started to shift as a result \nof the pandemic, though not in wholly positive \nways. One survey from April 2020 found that 2% \nof former smokers surveyed had decided to quit \nduring the previous four months at least in part due \nto COVID-19. However, in the same survey, 10% of \ncurrent smokers reported smoking more indoors; 20% \nbuying tobacco in larger quantities and 14% being \nless likely to try to quit, since the start of ‘lockdown’43. \nCOVID-19 may present a ‘teachable moment’ (often \nassociated with health-related events such as surgery, \npregnancy, or disease diagnosis)44 during which \nsome smokers may be particularly susceptible to \nsmoking cessation messages and motivated to make \nquit attempts. As such, this opportunity should be \nharnessed to maximum effect. \nSpecialist smoking cessation services providing \npsychological and pharmacological interventions \nare proven to be cost-effective, and improve success \nrates compared to unaided quit attempts45. On-\ngoing reductions to public health funding pose a \nmajor challenge in ensuring equitable access to \nthese services, with many local authorities having \ndecommissioned or reduced smoking cessation \nservices provision46. Urgent action should be taken \nto maximise visibility and reach of local, regional and \nnational support that is available, and to enable easy \naccess to pharmacological therapies locally. \nGuidance issued by the National Centre for \nSmoking Cessation and Training aims to support UK \nsmoking cessation services in significantly changing \ntheir traditional delivery models in response to \nCOVID-1947. This includes increasing capacity for \ntelephone and digital support, facilitating remote \naccess to nicotine replacement products, and \npausing the use of carbon monoxide monitoring. \nWhile necessary, given current circumstances, these \nchanges present a range of challenges to the effective \nidentification of smokers, verification of self-reported \nquit attempts and maximisation of successful quit rates, \nand may contribute to widening health inequalities.\nOpportunities to share learning around the adoption \nof new approaches to delivering smoking cessation \nservices should be maximised, including effective \nmessaging to communicate risk around COVID-19 \nto smokers, and challenging disinformation that may \nbe circulating. Smokers unable to quit should be \nencouraged to minimise the exposure of household \nmembers to secondhand smoke by smoking outside \nwherever possible, and to practice meticulous hand \nhygiene to reduce risk of transmission. \nAt the time of writing, smokers are not designated \nas high risk from COVID-19 within UK Government \nguidance8,48. This may change as our understanding \nof a potential association develops. It is important \nthat this relationship be investigated via studies that \nReview Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2020;18(July):58\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/124788\n9\ncan address some of the underlying limitations of the \nexisting evidence-base. This should include studies \nthat actively collect (preferably validated) smoking \nstatus, rather than relying on existing health records. \nIt also highly important to improve and standardise \nrecording practices regarding smoking status in health \nand social care settings, to ensure that this cohort is \neasily identified and offered appropriate guidance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThough early primary research has been constrained \nby the emerging nature of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand inherent methodological challenges, more \nevidence is regularly being published. By considering \nthe findings of eight systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses, we have conducted a sizeable review of \nthe current evidence regarding the relationship \nbetween smoking and COVID-19. We highlight the \nimportance of bespoke research utilising appropriate \ndocumentation of smoking status and robust study \ndesign. Despite some uncertainty regarding the exact \nnature and magnitude of the association between \nsmoking and COVID-19, there is growing evidence \nto support the WHO’s position that ‘smokers are at \nhigher risk of developing severe disease and death’ 49. \nTherefore, public health messaging should strongly \nhighlight the benefits of smoking cessation and \nnot detract from the importance of this during the \npandemic or in the aftermath. \nREFERENCES\n1. \t Lawrence H, Hunter A, Murray R, Lim WS, McKeever \nT.

However, we do not know \nenough about various factors that affect COVID-19, a \ndisease caused by this virus. For example, it is not known if \nthe virus affects smokers and non-smokers in the same way \nor to the same extent. \nIt is well known that smoking damages the immune \nsystem and lung tissues. As a result, chronic smokers are \nmore sensitive to infectious agents. They are twice as likely \nto get the flu, and flu symptoms are usually more severe in \nsmokers. Tobacco smoking is also clearly associated with \nlung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In \nSerbia, the incidence of smoking is slowly decreasing. Two \nuseful health actions possibly blunted this harmful habit. A \nlong time ago, one was introduced in Yugoslavia by medical \nstudents from Tuzla and Banja Luka (January 31, the Non-\nSmoking Day) several years before the World Health \nOrganization determined that May 31 would be the World \nNoTobacco Day 1, 2. \nIn a previous coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in \n2012, smokers had higher mortality than nonsmokers 3. It is \nthus important to establish the effect of tobacco smoking on the \noutcomes of infection with COVID-19. Since the beginning of \nthe current pandemic, Chinese doctors sought a relationship \nbetween smoking and this viral disease. Accordingly, they \nmeasured not only mortality but also the number of infections in \nboth smokers and non-smokers, the ratios of the number of these \npatients who required intensive care to those who did not, and \nhow many required mechanical respiration. \nIn one of five such studies conducted in Wuhan 4, 191 \npatients were followed, 137 survived and 54 died. Among \nthe dead, 9% were smokers and 4% were non-smokers. \nAnother, more extensive study 5 showed that smokers were \n1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms requiring \nplacement in intensive care units with mechanical \nrespiration. Although these, and most other published results, \nindicate a negative impact of smoking on this viral disease 6, \none exception is the study by Lippi and Henry 7 of Chinese \npatients that was based on preliminary meta-analysis. They \nfound that smoking did not seem to be significantly \nassociated with enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 disease. \nFurther research should determine whether the impact is \nsignificant in better-designed studies. \nBecause there are many smokers in some parts of \nSerbia, a large number of people are at risk for this viral \ndisease. It would be worthwhile to establish the severity of \nCOVID-19 disease in several populations: smokers, passive \nsmokers (people who live with a smoker in the household or \nwork in smoking rooms), former smokers (those who quit \nsmoking more than a year ago) and non-smokers. This will \ndetermine how our population reacts to exposure to tobacco \nsmoke. \nIn addition to the effects of tobacco smoke on the \nspread of coronavirus and the severity of COVID-19 \ninfection, it is worth noting that smoking stimulates the liver \nenzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP2B6, that \nmetabolize various drugs, including chloroquine and \nhydrochloroquine. Hospitalized patients rapidly become \nnonsmokers because smoking is prohibited there. In addition \nto abstinence problems, the activities of liver enzymes \ngradually decrease, and in a week enzyme activity \napproximates that of non-smokers 8. If a smoker takes a drug \nthat is metabolized in the liver before coming to the hospital, \nand continues with the same higher dose, after becoming an \nenforced non-smoker, it may cause toxic effects. These \nantimalaria drugs have not even been proven effective for \nresolution of COVID-19. \nIn this time of home isolation and social distancing, \nmany people tend to increase their cigarette consumption, \nPage 462 \nVOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED \nVol. 77, No 5 \nIgić R. Vojnosanit Pregl 2020; 77(5): 461–462. \nincluding the relapse of former smokers \n9. Pandemic \nmanagement teams, including all doctors, should openly \naddress this problem so that the general public becomes \naware of the risks. In addition to information provided about \nthe harmfulness of increased cigarette consumption for the \noutcome of COVID-19 infection, smokers should be advised \nto reduce or quit using cigarettes. Ex-smokers might rely on \nnon-pharmacological procedures, or they might temporarily \nuse pure nicotine pharmaceutical preparations or the nicotine \nantagonist, \nbupropion. \nBupropion \nreduces \nnicotine \ndependence and may be used in an abstinence crisis 10. \n \nR E F E R E N C E S  \n1.

There is little evidence about smoking\nand risk of infection. We aim to examine association between smoking and COVID-19\ninfection and subsequent mortality.\nMethods: This was a prospective study with participants from the UK Biobank cohort.\nParticipants who lived in England were followed up from 01/02/2020 to 28/06/2020 with\ndata linked to hospital episode statistics, Office for National Statistics and Public Health\nEngland PCR tests. We compared current-smokers, previous-smokers with never-smokers\nand estimated risk ratio (RR) of COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality using Poisson\nregression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index and socio-economic status.\nInteractions between smoking status and age and sex were tested for using multiplicative\ninteractions, and analyses were stratified by median age (49–68 years, 69–86 years) and sex.\nResults: In total, 402,978 participants were included in the analyses. The majority were\nnever smokers, 226,294 (56.2%), 140,090 (34.8%) were previous smokers, and 39,974\n(9.9%) current smokers. COVID-19 infection was identified in 1591 (0.39%) people, and\n372/1591 (23.4%) died. Amongst the younger participants, smokers were nearly twice as\nlikely to become infected with COVID-19 than never smokers (RR 1.88 [1.49–2.38])\nwhereas there was no difference for those aged 69+ (RR 1.05 [0.82–1.34]). In contrast,\namongst the older participants, smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19\ncompared to non-smokers (RR 2.15 [1.11–4.16]) whereas there was no difference for those\nunder the age of 69 (RR 1.22[0.83–1.79]). Similar patterns were observed for previous\nsmokers. The impact of smoking was similar in men and women.\nConclusion: The association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent\ndeath is modified by age. Smokers and previous smokers aged under 69 were at higher risk\nof COVID-19 infection, suggesting the risk is associated with increased exposure to SARS-\nCOV-2 virus. Once infected, older smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than\nnever smokers, possibly mediated by increased risk of chronic conditions/illnesses.\nKeywords: smoking, COVID-19, UK Biobank\nIntroduction\nThere has been some debate as to whether smoking increases the risk of SARS-\nCoV-2 infection and subsequent disease (COVID-19) and related mortality.\nAvailable evidence regarding the impact of smoking on disease progression and\ndeath amongst COVID-19 patients is conflicting.

First,\nthere is a need to disentangle the risks of smoking and\nCOVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Smokers may be\nmore or less likely to become infected than never smokers\nor previous smokers. Once infected the chance of survival\nmay also differ between smokers, never smokers and pre-\nvious smokers. Also, we do not know whether the impact\nof smoking differs in men and women or in younger\nversus elderly people.\nIn this study, we used data from the UK biobank cohort\nwhich is one of the largest study samples including reliable\ninformation on smoking status, COVID-19 infection, and\nmortality in the Spring of 2020. Our aim was to examine\nthe association between smoking and COVID-19 infec-\ntion, and the association between smoking and COVID-\n19 mortality among those infected.\nMaterials and Methods\nData Sources\nWe used data from the UK Biobank study and include all\nEngland participants who were alive on 1 February 2020\nand\nhad\ngiven\npermission\nto\nuse\ntheir\ndata\nby\n7 February 2020. UK Biobank includes data from all\nfour countries, Wales, Scotland, England, and Northern\nIreland, but COVID-19 test data were only available for\nEngland. We used information on participants which were\ncollected via questionnaires, physical measurements and\ninterviews in baseline assessments (2006–10).7,8\nStudy Population and Follow-Up\nOf\nthe\n502,655\nUK\nBiobank\nparticipants,\n408,724\n(81.31%)\nwere\neligible\nfor\ninclusion\nin\nthe\nstudy.\nHowever, 5746 (1.40%) participants were excluded due\nto missing information on body mass index, smoking or\nethnicity and 402,978 were included in the regression\nanalyses. The population selection process is shown in\nFigure 1.\nParticipants were followed-up until death or the end of\nthe study (28/06/2020). The analysis of COVID-19 mor-\nbidity was based on the full cohort. The analysis of mor-\ntality was based on the cohort of people who had\nconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection (n=1591).\nStudy Outcomes\nThis study included two separate outcomes: 1) COVID-19\ninfection, 2) death with COVID-19. COVID-19 infection\nwas defined based on a SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test or\nhaving COVID codes on death registry. PCR test informa-\ntion was retrieved from UK Biobank linkage to Public\nHealth England COVID-19 test data.9 We obtained data\non who was tested and test results. Patients were consid-\nered positive if one or more of the tests performed were\npositive for SARS-CoV-2. Death data was provided to UK\nBiobank by NHS Digital from linkage with NHS Central\nRegister (NHSCR). Patients were considered to have died\nwith COVID-19 if they died after a positive test or had\na codified COVID cause of death.\nExposures and Measurements\nThe main exposure variable was smoking status. This\ninformation was collected during the UK Biobank\nrecruitment visits (2006–2010). Smoking status is based\non two questions: “Do you smoke tobacco now?” and\n“In the past, how often have you smoked tobacco?”.\nThese questions were recoded into a single variable\nwith the following categories: Current, previous, never\nand prefer not to answer. Sex and year of birth were\nacquired from the National Health Service Central\nRegister (NHSCR) at recruitment. Information on ethni-\ncity was classified using Office of National Statistics\ngroups\ninto\nBlack/Black\nBritish,\nWhite,\nand\nother\ngroups. Socioeconomic status was based on the index\nof multiple deprivation (IMD) and derived from the\nplace of residency. IMD England 2010 index, rank, and\ndeciles were used to stratify participants into IMD\nquintiles.\nWe identified data from linked Hospital Episodes\nStatistics (HES) on a number of chronic illnesses and\nother conditions which have previously been considered\nto be associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality,\nhypertensive disease, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S300597\nDovePress\nClinical Epidemiology 2021:13\n358\nPrats-Uribe et al\nDovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ndiseases, other forms of heart disease including heart fail-\nure, chronic lower respiratory diseases (COPD or asthma),\nand renal failure (see Supplemental Table 1).\nPermission to Use of the Data\nThis research was conducted using the UK Biobank\nResource under Application Number 46,228. Although\nthe original application was unrelated to COVID-19\nwork, an exception was made to allow these linked data\nto be used for COVID-19 research without further applica-\ntions, to maximize the speed of the proposed study.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated the proportion of never smokers, previous\nsmokers and current smokers for each category of baseline\ncharacteristics for the full cohort and for the cohort who\nbecame infected with COVID-19. Patients with missing\ndata or a “Prefer not to Answer” response were subse-\nquently excluded in the regression analyses.\nWe fitted multivariable Poisson models. The first model\nto estimate the incidence risk ratios (IRR) of COVID-19\ninfection according to smoking status and the second to\nestimate the IRR of death amongst those infected. We pro-\nduced non-adjusted models as well as models adjusting for\nconfounding including sex, age, deprivation, ethnicity, body\nmass index (BMI) and all of them. To assess the modifica-\ntion effect of age and sex on the association between smok-\ning\nexposure\nand\nCOVID-19\noutcomes,\nwe\nadded\nmultiplicative interaction terms to the unadjusted models.\nWe stratified the models by age (below and above the med-\nian age 69) and sex where the likelihood ratio test comparing\nthe model with and without the multiplicative interaction\nterms was statistically significant (2-sided P <.05).\nIn these analyses, we contrasted: 1) current smokers\nagainst never smokers and 2) previous smokers against\nnever smokers. Thus, we used the analyses of previous\nsmokers as a “negative control” analysis. This allowed us\nto evaluate whether smoking per se increases the risk of\nCOVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality or other\nfactors may be “at play”.\nWe considered whether to include chronic illnesses/\nconditions in our regression analyses, but decided against\nit as many of these are likely to be on the causal pathway\nbetween smoking and the outcome rather than actual\n502,506 in UKBiobank\n69,773 Non-England \n \nresidents\n432,733 England residents\n408,724 alive on 01/02/2020\n402,978 complete cases\n1,591 test positive \nfor SARS-CoV-2 or\nwith COVID-19 \ndiagnosis\n372 death\nafter COVID-19\n1,503 test positive \nfor SARS-CoV-2 \n284 death\nafter COVID-19\n24,009 died before\n \n01/02/2020\n5,745 missed BMI,\n \nsmoking or ethnicity\nFigure 1 Selection process of eligible participants in UK.\nClinical Epidemiology 2021:13\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S300597\nDovePress\n359\nDovepress\nPrats-Uribe et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nconfounding\nthe\nassociations\nbetween\nsmoking\nand\nCOVID-19 infection and COVID-19 mortality.\nFinally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with only\nthose who tested positive. The results of this analysis are\nreported in Supplemental Table 2.\nData management was performed in Python 3.7.6. All\nanalyses were performed in STATA version 15.1.\nResults\nIn the full cohort (COVID-19 naïve cohort), 224,451\n(55.7%), 139,056 (34.5%), and 39,471 (9.8%) reported\nthat they were never smoking, previous smoking and cur-\nrent smoking, respectively (Table 1). The proportion of\ncurrent smokers declined with age. It was highest among\nthe 49–54 years old (14.5%) and lowest among the 80–86\nyears old (5.4%) (Table 1). Among the men 11.6% were\ncurrent smokers while 8.4% of the women were current\nsmokers. In general, many chronic illnesses/conditions\nwere higher among current and previous smokers than\nnever smokers. For example, of those infected with\nCOVID-19 - a 1/3 of the smokers had hypertensive dis-\neases while ¼ of the never smokers had hypertensive\ndiseases (Table 1).\nDuring the study period, 1591/402,978 (0.39%) tested\npositive for COVID-19 or had a death certificate with\na COVID-19 cause. Table 2 shows the incidence risk ratios\n(IRR) for COVID-19 infection and related mortality\naccording to smoking status. In total, 192 (0.49%) current\nsmokers, 628 (0.45%) previous smokers and 771 (0.34%)\nnever smokers were infected with COVID-19. Current\nsmoking was associated with greater risk of COVID-19\ninfection compared to never smoking across unadjusted\n[IRR: 1.42 (95% CI, 1.21–1.66)], age-sex adjusted [IRR:\n1.38\n(1.18–1.1.62)]\nand\nsocio-demographics\nadjusted\n[IRR: 1.27 (1.08–1.50)] models. Previous smoking was\nsimilarly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19\ninfection (Table 2).\nTCRM_A_310463There was an interaction effect of\nsex (P < 0.001) and age (P < 0.001) with smoking status\non the risk of COVID-19 infection. Smokers under the age\nof 69 years were nearly twice as likely to become infected\nwith COVID-19 than never smokers [adjusted IRR 1.88\n(1.49–2.38)] whereas there was no differential risk asso-\nciated with smoking for participants aged 69+ [age-sex\nadjusted IRR. 1.05 (0.82–1.34)]. Similar patterns were\nobserved for previous smokers (Figure 2). Among pre-\nvious smokers, the risk of COVID-19 infection was higher\namong men than women (Figure 2), but there was no sex\ndifference for current smokers.\nIn the 1591 individuals who tested positive for\nCOVID-19 or had a death certificate with a COVID-19\ncause, the proportion of smokers was slightly different\nfrom the COVID-19 naïve cohort, 771 (48.5%), 628\n(39.5%) and 192 (12%) reported that they were never,\nprevious smoking or current smoking, respectively (Table\n1). The smoking pattern also presented a reverse “U”\nshape with age, with fewer individuals smoking in the\nyoungest and oldest group (Table 1). In total 372/1591\n(23.4%) of the individuals who were infected with\nCOVID-19 died subsequently. This amounted to 56\n(29%) of the current smokers, 175 (27.9%) of previous\nsmokers and 141 (18%) never smokers. Current smoking\nwas associated with greater risk of death compared to\nnever smoking across unadjusted [IRR 1.59 (1.17–2.17)],\nage-sex adjusted [IRR 1.46 (1.07–2.00)] and socio-\ndemographics adjusted [IRR 1.49 (1.09–2.05)] models\n(Table 2).\nInteraction effect of age (P = 0.031) was also detected\nfor COVID-19 death. Older smokers aged 69 and above\nwere more than twice as likely to die from COVID-19\ncompared to non-smokers [age-sex adjusted IRR 2.15 (1.-\n11–4.16)]] while the association was less pronounced in\nthose younger than 69 years old [age-sex adjusted IRR\n1.22 (0.83–1.79)]. Similar patterns were observed for pre-\nvious smokers (Figure 2).\nA sensitivity analysis of mortality restricted to those\nwith confirmed (test+) COVID obtained similar results for\noutcomes of COVID-19 infection and related death\n(Supplementary Table 2).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to date investigat-\ning the association between smoking and risk of COVID-\n19 infection. We found that both current and previous\nsmoking were associated with increased risk of COVID-\n19 infection in those aged below 69 whereas there was no\ndifference between current smokers, previous smokers and\nnever smokers for those aged 69 and above. In contrast,\nthe COVID-19 mortality of smokers aged 69+ were twice\nas high compared to non-smokers (IRR 2.15 [1.11–4.16])\nwhile there was little or no difference between current\nsmokers and never smokers under the age of 69 (IRR\n1.22 [0.83–1.79]). The patterns were similar for previous\nsmokers.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S300597\nDovePress\nClinical Epidemiology 2021:13\n360\nPrats-Uribe et al\nDovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nInterpretation and Comparison with\nPrevious Studies\nIt is well established that smoking can cause a plethora of\nrespiratory diseases including lung cancer,10 asthma,11\npneumothorax,12\nand\nchronic\nobstructive\npulmonary\ndisease.13 There are also some evidence to suggest smok-\ning may contribute to a decline in immunity against infec-\ntions, although it plays dual roles in both innate and\nadaptive immune response.14 Li et al found that smoking\nis associated with a low number and impaired function of\nregulatory B cells among patients with Helicobacter pylori\n(H. pylori) infection.15 Also, evidence from an experimen-\ntal animal model has demonstrated that smoke exposure\ncould reduce effector and memory T cells in mice infected\nwith\nMycobacterium\ntuberculosis.16\nMost\nrecently,\nAlraddadi et al analysed 535 patients with laboratory-\nconfirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV) infection and identified smoking as an\nTable 1 Baseline Characteristics in COVID-19 Naïve and Infection Cohorts Stratified by Smoking Status\nCOVID-19 Naïve Cohort\nCOVID-19 Infection Cohorta\nTotal\nNever\nSmoking\nPrevious\nSmoking\nCurrent\nSmoking\nTotal\nNever\nSmoking\nPrevious\nSmoking\nCurrent\nSmoking\nN\n402,978\n224,451\n139,056\n39,471\n1591\n771\n628\n192\nSocio-demographics\nAge\n49–54\n24,674 (100.0)\n14,978 (60.7)\n6111 (24.8)\n3585 (14.5)\n121 (100.0)\n77 (63.6)\n32 (26.4)\n12 (9.9)\n55–59\n52,153 (100.0)\n32,310 (62.0)\n12,803 (24.5)\n7040 (13.5)\n266 (100.0)\n158 (59.4)\n73 (27.4)\n35 (13.2)\n60–64\n59,535 (100.0)\n36,085 (60.6)\n16,319 (27.4)\n7131 (12.0)\n193 (100.0)\n110 (57.0)\n59 (30.6)\n24 (12.4)\n65–69\n68,395 (100.0)\n38,599 (56.4)\n22,794 (33.3)\n7002 (10.2)\n182 (100.0)\n91 (50.0)\n65 (35.7)\n26 (14.3)\n70–74\n94,777 (100.0)\n50,476 (53.3)\n36,462 (38.5)\n7839 (8.3)\n262 (100.0)\n107 (40.8)\n111 (42.4)\n44 (16.8)\n75–79\n79,756 (100.0)\n39,646 (49.7)\n34,514 (43.3)\n5596 (7.0)\n398 (100.0)\n150 (37.7)\n208 (52.3)\n40 (10.1)\n80–86\n23,688 (100.0)\n12,357 (52.2)\n10,053 (42.4)\n1278 (5.4)\n166 (100.0)\n75 (45.2)\n80 (48.2)\n11 (6.6)\nSex\nFemale\n222,790 (100.0)\n134,105 (60.2)\n70,053 (31.4)\n18,632 (8.4)\n756 (100.0)\n439 (58.1)\n231 (30.6)\n86 (11.4)\nMale\n180,188 (100.0)\n90,346 (50.1)\n69,003 (38.3)\n20,839 (11.6)\n832 (100.0)\n329 (39.5)\n397 (47.7)\n106 (12.7)\nEthnicity\nWhite\n379,697 (100.0)\n208,186 (54.8)\n134,724 (35.5)\n36,787 (9.7)\n1387 (100.0)\n634 (45.7)\n587 (42.3)\n166 (12.0)\nMixed\n2505 (100.0)\n1229 (49.1)\n824 (32.9)\n452 (18.0)\n12 (100.0)\n4 (33.3)\n7 (58.3)\n1 (8.3)\nAsian or Asian British\n8492 (100.0)\n6585 (77.5)\n1109 (13.1)\n798 (9.4)\n68 (100.0)\n48 (70.6)\n10 (14.7)\n10 (14.7)\nBlack or Black British\n7108 (100.0)\n5045 (71.0)\n1233 (17.3)\n830 (11.7)\n86 (100.0)\n62 (72.1)\n14 (16.3)\n10 (11.6)\nChinese\n1311 (100.0)\n1045 (79.7)\n170 (13.0)\n96 (7.3)\n7 (100.0)\n5 (71.4)\n2 (28.6)\n0 (0.0)\nOther ethnic group\n3865 (100.0)\n2361 (61.1)\n996 (25.8)\n508 (13.1)\n28 (100.0)\n15 (53.6)\n8 (28.6)\n5 (17.9)\nIMD quintiles\n1 [least deprived]\n120,042 (100.0)\n72,141 (60.1)\n40,530 (33.8)\n7371 (6.1)\n338 (100.0)\n173 (51.2)\n132 (39.1)\n33 (9.8)\n2\n96,479 (100.0)\n55,439 (57.5)\n33,559 (34.8)\n7481 (7.8)\n294 (100.0)\n151 (51.4)\n115 (39.1)\n28 (9.5)\n3\n72,196 (100.0)\n39,995 (55.4)\n25,257 (35.0)\n6944 (9.6)\n285 (100.0)\n132 (46.3)\n118 (41.4)\n35 (12.3)\n4\n62,865 (100.0)\n32,502 (51.7)\n22,215 (35.3)\n8148 (13.0)\n313 (100.0)\n145 (46.3)\n129 (41.2)\n39 (12.5)\n5 [most deprived]\n51,396 (100.0)\n24,374 (47.4)\n17,495 (34.0)\n9527 (18.5)\n358 (100.0)\n167 (46.6)\n134 (37.4)\n57 (15.9)\nBMI\n27.4 (4.7)\n27.1 (4.8)\n27.8 (4.7)\n27.0 (4.7)\n28.8 (5.4)\n28.5 (5.4)\n29.5 (5.3)\n28.0 (5.5)\nMedical conditions\nHypertensive diseases\n101,644 (25.2)\n50,863 (22.7)\n41,054 (29.5)\n9727 (24.6)\n459 (28.9)\n193 (25.1)\n200 (31.8)\n66 (34.4)\nDiabetes mellitus\n26,578 (6.6)\n12,514 (5.6)\n10,946 (7.9)\n3118 (7.9)\n179 (11.3)\n81 (10.5)\n71 (11.3)\n27 (14.1)\nIschemic heart diseases\n35,155 (8.7)\n15,681 (7.0)\n15,424 (11.1)\n4050 (10.3)\n182 (11.5)\n69 (9.0)\n87 (13.9)\n26 (13.5)\nOther heart disease\n38,993 (9.7)\n18,788 (8.4)\n16,403 (11.8)\n3802 (9.6)\n240 (15.1)\n102 (13.3)\n112 (17.8)\n26 (13.5)\nChronic respiratory diseases\n42,581 (10.6)\n20,074 (8.9)\n16,391 (11.8)\n6116 (15.5)\n187 (11.8)\n82 (10.7)\n74 (11.8)\n31 (16.1)\nRenal failure\n15,617 (3.9)\n7362 (3.3)\n6472 (4.7)\n1783 (4.5)\n165 (10.4)\n71 (9.2)\n70 (11.1)\n24 (12.5)\nNote: aSARS-CoV-2 tested positive or COVID-19 hospitalization.\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index;

In tuberculosis, for\nexample, socioeconomic factors are associated with ther-\napy failure and drug resistance, and lead to worse out-\ncomes overall.20,21\nOur overall findings suggest that there was an associa-\ntion between current smoking and COVID-19 infection.\nYet, our stratified analyses suggest that the relationship\nbetween smoking and COVID-19 infection is complex.\nWe only found an association between smoking and\nCOVID-19 infection in those aged under 69 and similarly\nfor previous smokers, but not for those aged 69 and above.\nIt, therefore, seems plausible that the increased risk of\nCOVID-19 infection in current and previous smokers\nwas associated with increased risk of exposure to SARS-\nCoV-2 virus eg via increased occupational exposure rather\nthan increased susceptibility to the virus among smokers.\nPrevious evidence on the impact of smoking on disease\nprogression and death amongst COVID-19 patients is mixed\nand based on studies from many different settings.1,3,6\nWe found that current smoking was associated with\na substantial risk of COVID-19 death in those aged 69\nyears and above (IRR 2.15 1.11 to 4.16). Yet, the risk of\nCOVID-19 death was not much higher in current smokers\nthan never smokers under 69 years (IRR 1.22 0.83 to\n1.79). Similar patterns with age were observed for pre-\nvious smokers. This suggests that the association between\nsmoking and COVID-19 death may be multifaceted. The\nadverse impact of smoking on COVID-19 death may be\ndue to a direct weakening of the immune system.\nHowever, the elevated risk of dying from COVID-19\namong older current smokers and previous smokers, but\nnot among those aged below 69 suggest other factors may\nbe at play. For example, we observed that the prevalence\nof chronic illnesses/conditions such as diabetes, ischemic\nheart diseases, renal failure, and chronic lower respiratory\ndiseases (COPD and asthma) was higher among current\nTable 2 Associations of Smoking Status with Covid-19 Infection and Subsequent Death\nModel\nCovariates Adjustment\nNever\n[Ref]\nCovid-19 Infection a\nNever\n[Ref]\nCovid-19 Death b\nCurrent\nPrevious\nCurrent\nPrevious\nModel 1\nNone\n1\n1.42 [1.21,1.66]\n1.31 [1.18,1.46]\n1\n1.59 [1.17,2.17]\n1.52 [1.22,1.90]\nModel 1 + Age\n1\n1.43 [1.22,1.67]\n1.30 [1.17,1.45]\n1\n1.50 [1.10,2.05]\n1.16 [0.93,1.45]\nModel 1 + Sex\n1\n1.37 [1.17,1.60]\n1.28 [1.15,1.42]\n1\n1.52 [1.11,2.07]\n1.41 [1.12,1.76]\nModel 1 + Ethnicity\n1\n1.43 [1.22,1.68]\n1.40 [1.26,1.56]\n1\n1.60 [1.17,2.18]\n1.51 [1.21,1.89]\nModel 1 + IMD\n1\n1.21 [1.03,1.42]\n1.28 [1.15,1.42]\n1\n1.59 [1.17,2.17]\n1.53 [1.22,1.91]\nModel 1 + BMI\n1\n1.42 [1.22,1.67]\n1.27 [1.14,1.41]\n1\n1.61 [1.18,2.20]\n1.50 [1.20,1.87]\nModel 1 + Age + Sex\n1\n1.38 [1.18,1.62]\n1.27 [1.14,1.41]\n1\n1.46 [1.07,2.00]\n1.10 [0.88,1.39]\nModel 1 + Age + Sex +\nEthnicity\n1\n1.40 [1.19,1.64]\n1.34 [1.20,1.49]\n1\n1.46 [1.07,2.00]\n1.13 [0.90,1.42]\nModel 1 + Age + Sex + IMD\n1\n1.19 [1.01,1.40]\n1.23 [1.10,1.37]\n1\n1.44 [1.06,1.98]\n1.11 [0.88,1.40]\nModel 1 + Age + Sex + BMI\n1\n1.39 [1.18,1.63]\n1.22 [1.10,1.36]\n1\n1.49 [1.09,2.03]\n1.08 [0.86,1.36]\nModel 2\nModel 1 + all socio-\ndemographics\n1\n1.27 [1.08,1.50]\n1.26 [1.13,1.40]\n1\n1.49 [1.09,2.05]\n1.11 [0.88,1.40]\nNotes: aSARS-CoV-2 tested positive or with COVID-19 death cause. bDeath among participants with SARS-CoV-2 tested positive or with COVID-19 death cause.

Thus,\nit is likely that current smoking and previous smoking\nimpact the risk of COVID-19 death indirectly via these\nchronic illnesses/conditions.\nStrengths and Limitations of the\nStudy\nUnlike most of the published studies that retrospectively\nreviewed smoking history amongst hospitalized patients\nwith COVID-19, this is the first population-based study\nwhich prospectively examined association between smoking\nstatus and risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. Despite\nnot fully representative of the whole UK population, partici-\npants from UK Biobank are much less prone to significant\nsampling bias inevitable in hospital-based studies and\nenables our findings more generalizable to other settings.\nOur study has some limitations. First, the identifica-\ntion of COVID-19 infection might be underestimated by\nusing the laboratory-confirmed cases as suggested by the\nmost recent Office for National Statistics.22 However,\nsuch underestimation is likely to be non-differential\nbetween exposure groups and would bias the genuine\nassociation towards the null. Second, the smoking infor-\nmation was collected at baseline between 2006 and 2010\nand may have changed by 2020 when participants\nentered this study. However, it is unlikely that people\nwill start smoking after 40 years old, and therefore mis-\nclassification exposure would limit within current and\nprevious smoking groups, such as switching between\ncurrent smokers and previous smokers. Third, this study\nwas conducted among participants aged 49 years or\nolder. Thus, these findings may not be generalizable to\nyounger people whose immune response may modify the\neffect of smoking on COVID-19 outcomes, especially\ngiven that a noticeable interaction effect of age has\nbeen detected.\nSubgroups\nCOVID−19 infection\nSex\nFemale\nMale\nAge\n<69\n>=69\nCOVID−19 death\nSex\nFemale\nMale\nAge\n<69\n>=69\nNo. of \nparticipants\n(%)\n222800 (55.29)\n180197 (44.71)\n212656 (52.76)\n190341 (47.23)\n678 (47.41)\n743 (52.28)\n717 (50.45)\n704 (49.54)\nRelative risk\n[95% CI]\n1.40 [1.10,1.79]\n1.33 [1.04,1.71]\n1.44 [1.14,1.82]\n1.30 [1.03,1.65]\n1.88 [1.49,2.38]\n1.71 [1.35,2.17]\n1.05 [0.82,1.34]\n0.99 [0.77,1.26]\n1.55 [0.92,2.62]\n1.74 [1.01,2.98]\n1.40 [0.91,2.16]\n1.43 [0.92,2.23]\n1.22 [0.83,1.79]\n1.22 [0.83,1.80]\n2.15 [1.11,4.16]\n2.38 [1.21,4.68]\nRelative risk\nCurrent vs Never\nRelative risk\n[95% CI]\n1.05 [0.89,1.24]\n1.08 [0.91,1.28]\n1.49 [1.27,1.74]\n1.45 [1.23,1.70]\n1.46 [1.26,1.70]\n1.42 [1.22,1.66]\n1.09 [0.92,1.30]\n1.14 [0.95,1.36]\n1.00 [0.66,1.51]\n1.15 [0.74,1.81]\n1.13 [0.83,1.54]\n1.15 [0.84,1.58]\n1.03 [0.78,1.35]\n1.06 [0.80,1.39]\n1.60 [0.93,2.76]\n1.61 [0.91,2.85]\nRelative risk\nAge−sex adjusted\nFully adjusted\nPrevious vs Never\n0.7  1.0      1.5   2.0     3.0   4.0\n0.7  1.0      1.5   2.0     3.0   4.0\nFigure 2 Relative risks of COVID-19 infection and subsequent death by sex and age.\nClinical Epidemiology 2021:13\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S300597\nDovePress\n363\nDovepress\nPrats-Uribe et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nClinical Implications\nWe found that the risk of COVID-19 infection was ele-\nvated for both current and previous smokers under the age\nof 69, but not for those 69 and above. The clinical impli-\ncation of these findings is that change in smoking habits is\nunlikely to have major impact on the risk of COVID-19\ninfection.\nFactors such as age, male sex, obesity and chronic\nconditions/illnesses have been identified as independent\nrisk factors for severe COVID-19 infection and death,1,23\nenabling the health professionals more effectively and pre-\ncisely locate limited medical resources for the treatment of\nCOVID-19. Our study suggests that current and past smok-\ning history should also be taken into consideration when\nassessing the risk of COVID-19 death in those aged 69 and\nabove. Although smoking on its own may have a limited\ndirect impact on the risk of COVID-19 death both smoking\nand previous smoking appears be indirect indicators of the\nelevated risk of dying from COVID-19 via their associa-\ntions with chronic conditions/illnesses.\nConclusion\nThe association between smoking and COVID-19 infec-\ntion and subsequent death is modified by age. Smokers and\nprevious smokers aged under 69 were at higher risk of\nCOVID-19 infection, suggesting the risk is associated with\nincreased exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus. Once infected,\nolder smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19\nthan never smokers, possibly mediated by increased risk of\nchronic conditions/illnesses.\nEthical Approval\nThe North West Multi-center Research Ethics Committee\n(MREC) approved the collection and use of UK Biobank\ndata (16/NW/0274).

Guo1,2\nDear Editor,\nThe letter to the Editor of Lippi and Henry1 published in the European Journal \nof Internal Medicine and entitled ‘Active smoking is not associated with severity \nof coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)’ had errors and led to the wrong \nconclusion. \nLippi and Henry1 searched PubMed and Web of Science up to 9 March 2020, \nand identified 5 studies2-6 with data on smoking and severity of COVID-19. They \nperformed a meta-analysis revealing a pooled OR of 1.69 (95% CI: 0.41–6.92) and \nconcluded that active smoking does not seem to be significantly associated with \nenhanced risk of progressing towards severe disease in COVID-19. There were \nseveral mistakes in their data collection that led to errors in the meta-analysis. \nIn table 1 of their letter, they indicated the outcome of Guan et al. study2 to be \n‘Admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, death’, however, they used the data \nof ‘severe disease’ in the study. According to the Guan et al.2 paper, the number \nof patients having composite outcome should be 66, and for patients not having \na composite outcome should be 1019. However, Lippi and Henry1 used 172 and \n913, respectively, in their paper. This is the most serious mistake because the \nGuan et al.1 study contributes to most of the cases in the meta-analysis. Moreover, \nthe non-severe patients in the Huang et al.3 study should be 28 and not 31. The \nnon-severe patients in the Yang et al.5 study should be 20 and not 18. The severe \npatients in the Zhang et al.6 should be 58 and not 60. The errors led to the wrong \nsample size of these 3 studies as well. Lippi and Henry1 were only correct in one4 \nout of the 5 studies.\nI performed an updated meta-analysis according to the correct data using \nRevMan Ver. 5.3, and provide the forest plot (Figure 1). The pooled OR was 2.20 \n(95% CI: 1.31–3.67; p=0.003). The heterogeneity was moderate (I2=57%). There \nwas no obvious publication bias by the funnel plot. Though there are new studies \npublished after the Lippi and Henry1 paper, the purpose of this letter is to correct \ntheir errors, therefore new studies are not included in the updated meta-analysis.\nIn a systemic review published by Vardavas and Nikitara7, 5 studies were \nincluded.

A recent meta-analysis including 7 studies also revealed that smokers have a double risk of severe \nCOVID-19 (pooled OR=1.98; 95% CI: 1.29–3.05)8. A meta-analysis published in 2019 including 27 studies \nand 460592 participants revealed current smokers (pooled OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.70–2.76) and ex-smokers \n(pooled OR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.26–1.75) were more likely to develop community-acquired pneumonia compared \nto never smokers9. The evidence suggests that smokers are more vulnerable to lung infection, and COVID-19 \nis no exception.\nIn conclusion, the results of this updated meta-analysis suggest that active smoking is significantly associated \nwith the risk of severe COVID-19. Though more data are available now, they are not included in this study. \nHowever, the early meta-analysis of the Lippi and Henry1 paper should have had different results.\nREFERENCES\n1.\t Lippi G, Henry BM.

The tobacco \nepidemic is set to continue, despite assurances from many \ntobacco companies that smoke-free devices are safer than \ntraditional cigarettes.\nDuring the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, \nthe issue of tobacco smoking and risk for acute respiratory \ninfection is again topical. Much of the global focus on \ntobacco prevention and cessation focuses around non-\ninfective respiratory, cardiovascular, and cancer related \ndeaths, and much of the e-cigarette promotional rhetoric \nrevolves around potentially saving billions of lives that might \notherwise be lost due to these non-infective outcomes. The \nrisk of infectious complications is, however, the predominant \nfocus and concern in low-income and middle-income \ncountries, particularly during pandemics. Some countries, \nfor example South Africa and India, have banned the sale of \ntobacco products during lockdown periods. Whether this \nban is justified and supported by evidence of harm from the \ncombined effect of tobacco use and COVID-19 is uncertain, as \nis whether current smokers can be expected to simply stop \nduring a pandemic.\nRobust evidence suggests that several mechanisms \nmight increase the risk of respiratory tract infections \nin smokers. Smoking impairs the immune system and \nalmost doubles the risk of tuberculosis infection (latent \nand active) due to impairment of immune function; \nspecifically, smoking affects the macrophage and cytokine \nresponse and hence the ability to contain infection. \nSimilarly the risk for pneumococcal, legionella, and \nmycoplasma pneumonia infection is about 3–5-times \nhigher in smokers. Users of tobacco and e-cigarettes have \nincreased adherence of pneumococci and colonisation, as \na result of the upregulation of the pneumococcal receptor \nmolecule (platelet activating receptor factor); smokers are \nalso 5-times more likely to contract influenza than non-\nsmokers.\nData from the previous Middle Eastern respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus (MERS) and severe respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus (SARS) is scarce. A single study from \nKorea reported a 2·55 (95% CI 1·1–5·9) increased risk of \nmortality in smokers with MERS, but this study included \nonly eight smokers. For COVID-19, data are also scarce; \none review did not report on smoking as a risk factor for \ninfection, but did report an increased risk of severe disease \n(relative risk [RR] 1·4 [95% CI 0·98–2·00]) and need for \nmechanical ventilation or death (RR 2·4 [1·43–4·04]) \nfor current smokers. Another meta-analysis did not find \nan association between current smoking and disease \nseverity. The largest study to date (pre-print), from the \nUK, reports an increased risk for death in current smokers \ncompared with never-smokers of 1·25 (95% CI 1·12–1·40) \nwhen adjusted for age and sex, which decreased to 0·88 \n(0·79–0·99) when fully adjusted.\nMechanistic studies postulate that the increased \nsusceptibility to infection might be due to upregulation \nof the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, \nthe main receptor used by the severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to gain entry to host \nmucosa and cause active infection—an apparently unique \nmechanism to this virus. Current smokers have increased \ngene expression of ACE2, than previous smokers and non-\nsmokers. In addition, there is an association between FEV1 \nand ACE2 gene expression. Despite this association, it is \nunclear whether modification of ACE2 receptor frequency or \navailability has an effect on mortality. Certainly, patients on \nACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers \n(ARBs) do not appear to be at increased risk of infection \nor death. Non-peer-reviewed data released from France \nsuggests that smoking might have a potential protective \neffect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, via interaction with \nthe acetylcholine receptor, but these data have not been \nconfirmed and should not in any way be an indicator to start \nor continue smoking.\nThe challenge for studies of COVID-19 is to have large \nenough sample sizes to allow correction for confounders, \nsuch as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, race, sex, and \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), all of \nwhich might be associated with tobacco smoking and \npoor outcomes. Currently, no evidence suggests that \ne-cigarette use increases the risk of being infected by \nSARS-CoV-2.\nIt is possible that the period of self-isolation and \nlockdown restrictions during this pandemic could \nbe used by some as an opportunity to quit smoking, \nbut realistically only a minority of people will achieve \ncessation. For the majority, the increased stress of a \npotentially fatal disease, possibility of loss of employment, \nfeelings of insecurity, confinement, and boredom, could \nincrease the desire to smoke. During the financial collapse \nof 2008, tobacco shares were one of  the only shares to \nincrease.\nHere, we suggest a few steps to help reduce tobacco \nuse during this pandemic and hopefully long after. First, \nevery smoker should be encouraged to stop, be provided \nwith advice, support, and pharmacotherapy, if available; \ntimes of crisis can often provide the impetus to stop \nsmoking. Banning tobacco sales might not be wholly \neffective if people are still able to access cigarettes and so \nother measures need to be implemented to discourage \ntobacco use.

To determine \nthe effect smoking might have on infection, it is essential \nthat every person tested for COVID-19, and for other \nrespiratory infectious diseases, should be asked about \ntheir smoking history. All outcomes related to screening, \ntesting, admission, ventilation, recovery, and death need \nto be evaluated relative to smoking status and adjusted \nfor comorbid conditions, such as ischaemic heart disease \nand COPD.\nFinally, the world should aim to be tobacco free, but \ngiven the intricate web of finance, taxes, jobs, lobbying, \nand payments made to officials, this is unlikely to happen \nin the near future. However, the battle against tobacco use \nshould continue, by assisting smokers to successfully and \npermanently quit.

Fortuitous timing, \nbut if there is one lesson from Netflix’s thorough new \ndocumentary series, it is that the world is always on the \nbrink of an epidemic of catastrophic potential. Pandemic \nlargely focuses on influenza, though a visit to a live animal \nand seafood market in Vietnam offers a reminder of \nthe range of zoonotic diseases that can emerge from all \nthose creatures kept in close quarters.

We track attempts by a small \nbiotechnology firm to develop a universal influenza \nvaccine, efforts by researchers on different continents \nto monitor the pathogens that circulate in bats and \nmigrating birds, and the exhausting work that goes into \nmaintaining a cash-strapped rural hospital in the USA. \nA foray to the Ebola-stricken states of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo highlights the hazards of epidemic \nresponse in regions where insecurity and mistrust are rife; \nwhile a trip to Rajasthan, India, shows how poverty and \novercrowded living conditions permit infectious diseases \nto proliferate.\nThe programme makers even find room for the vaccine-\nhesitant.

Participants who reported that they did not \nfeel physically normal were then asked by the app to \ncomplete a series of questions, including 14 potential \nCOVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The \nmain study outcome was the development of ’classic’ \nsymptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined \nas fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and \ntheir association with current smoking. The number of \nconcurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy \nfor severity and the pattern of association between \nsymptoms was also compared between smokers and \nnon-­smokers.\nResults  Between 24 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, \ndata were available on 2 401 982 participants, mean \n(SD) age 43.6 (15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall \nsmoking prevalence 11.0%. 834 437 (35%) participants \nreported being unwell and entered one or more \nsymptoms. Current smokers were more likely to report \nsymptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic \nsymptoms adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.14 (1.10 to 1.18); \n>5 symptoms 1.29 (1.26 to 1.31); >10 symptoms 1.50 \n(1.42 to 1.58). The pattern of association between \nreported symptoms did not vary between smokers and \nnon-­smokers.\nInterpretation  These data are consistent with people \nwho smoke being at an increased risk of developing \nsymptomatic COVID-19.\nINTRODUCTION\nAlthough \nin \nmany \npeople \ninfection \nwith \nSARS-­CoV-2 is asymptomatic, some develop symp-\ntomatic COVID-19 and in some individuals there \nis progressive lung involvement with respiratory \nfailure and widespread systemic consequences.1–3 \nThe risk of severe complications is higher in older \npeople and those with long-­term medical condi-\ntions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and \nCOPD.4–7\nTobacco smoking is a significant risk factor for \nboth viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory \nsystem,8 9 with smokers five times as likely to develop \ninfluenza and twice as likely to have pneumonia.10 It \nmay therefore be an important factor worsening the \nimpact of SARS-­CoV-2. There is evidence from case \nseries that smoking is associated with more severe \ndisease, a greater risk of intensive care unit admis-\nsion and excess mortality in people with COVID-19 \nadmitted to hospital.4 11–14 However, some reports \nhave suggested that although smoking-­related \ndisease is common in patients with COVID-19, \ncurrent smoking rates in hospitalised patients are \nlower than would be expected from population \nsmoking prevalence. While some studies have \nlooked specifically at current smoking,12–14 others \ncombined current and ex-­smokers,4 11 and smoking \nprevalence in these samples suggest data may have \nbeen incomplete. It is important to be able to distin-\nguish the effect of current smoking from the impact \nKey messages\nWhat is the key question?\n►\n►Does current smoking increase individuals’ risk \nof developing symptomatic COVID-19?\nWhat is the bottom line?\n►\n►In this study of 2.4 million users entering data \ninto the Zoe COVID-19 Symptom Study app \nin the month from 24 March 2020, smokers \nwere more likely to report the ‘classic triad’ \nof symptoms suggesting COVID-19 (cough, \nfever, breathlessness) and also more likely to \nreport more symptoms, a surrogate for disease \nseverity.\nWhy read on?\n►\n►These population symptom data support the \ncontention that smoking increases individual \nrisk from COVID-19.\n►\n►The pattern of associations between symptoms \nreported did not vary between smokers and \nnon-­smokers, suggesting that the findings \ncannot be explained by pre-­existing smoking-­\nrelated symptoms.\n►\n►Support to help people to quit smoking should \ntherefore form part of efforts to deal with the \npandemic.\n714   \nHopkinson NS, et al.

We hypothesised that current \nsmokers would be at increased risk of developing self-­reported \nsymptoms suggesting that they had COVID-19 and would expe-\nrience more symptoms reflecting a greater illness burden.\nMETHODS\nData and analysis\nAdult members of the public were invited to download the Zoe \nCOVID-19 Symptom Study app after its launch on radio, TV and \nvia social media. On first use, the app records users’ self-­reported \nlocation, age and core health risk factors, including height and \nweight, if they smoked with options; yes, not currently, never. \nParticipants were asked about common disease (eg, diabetes, \nheart disease, lung disease) status, some medication use as well \nas whether they thought that they already had COVID.15\nWith continued use, participants were asked to provide daily \nupdates on whether they have been tested for SARS-­CoV-2 and \nthe results of these tests as well as if they ‘feel physically normal’. \nIf they reported that they did not, they were then invited by \nthe app to record the presence of 14 symptoms that have been \nshown to be associated with COVID-1915 (ie, abdominal pain, \nchest pain, delirium, diarrhoea, fatigue, fever, headache, hoarse \nvoice, loss of smell, persistent cough, shortness of breath, skipped \nmeals, sore throat, unusual muscle pains) and whether they had \nattended hospital. Fatigue and shortness of breath were graded \nby symptom severity, ranging from mild to severe.\nStudy population\nThe study population for this analysis comprised individuals \nresident in the UK who were registered with the app and entered \ndata between 24 March and 23 April 2020. We collected all \nsymptoms declared by each participant during the period which \nthey engaged with the app. More details about user engagement \nand the overall distribution of reported symptoms are shown \nin online supplemental figures E1-2. While the response option \nfor the majority of symptoms was yes/no, fatigue and shortness \nof breath were considered present if any level of severity was \nreported. Where a possible symptom response was missing it was \ntreated as absent. Questions about race and ethnic origin were \nonly included for people registering with the app after 17 April \n2020,16 so this information was available only for a small subset \n(12%) of individuals in the dataset.\nFor this analysis, people reporting their age as outside the \nrange 16–90 years or their body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) \noutside 15–55 years were excluded (n=310 462). We further \nremoved 50 187 individuals due to inconsistent assessments, \nwhere users (i) reported being tested both positive and negative \nfor SARS-­CoV-2 on the same day, (ii) logged a body temperature \noutside the range of 35°C–43°C or (iii) reported feeling unwell \nbut entered no symptoms). We also excluded women who \ndeclared themselves to be pregnant (n=8680).\nStatistical analysis\nThe main study outcome was the development of ‘classic’ \nsymptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, \nnew persistent cough and breathlessness and their association \nwith current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 \nsymptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of \nassociation between symptoms was also compared between \nsmokers and non-­smokers. We first investigated associations \nbetween smoking status and individual COVID-19 symptoms \nusing logistic regression, including age, sex and BMI as covari-\nates. Statistical analyses were carried out using R (V.3.6.0). The \nBonferroni-­adjusted threshold for statistical significance was \ncalculated by dividing a conventional alpha value of 0.05 by the \nnumber of tested groups and the effective number of indepen-\ndent symptoms, which were estimated based on their pairwise \npolychoric correlation coefficients (polycor R package, V.0.7-10), \nusing the method by Li and Ji.17 The resulting p value threshold \nwas 0.05/4/11=1.14×10−3. Association p values below this \nthreshold were considered to be statistically significant.\nSmoking association with COVID-19 symptom burden in \nstandard users\nWe further explored the effect of smoking on COVID-19 \nseverity among standard users (ie, subjects neither tested for \nSARS-­CoV-2 nor self-­reporting prior suspected COVID-19 \ninfection at the time of registration) by examining associa-\ntion between smoking status and the development of a greater \nsymptom burden. We took the number of reported COVID-19 \nsymptoms as a proxy for disease severity, but did not attempt \nto weight different symptoms. Tested logistic regression models \nfirst addressed the impact of current smoking on the primary \nend point defined as the presence of all the classic triad of symp-\ntoms (ie, fever, persistent cough and shortness of breath consis-\ntent with COVID-19 caseness). In addition, we investigated the \npresence of (i) >5 symptoms and (ii) >10 symptoms taking these \nas arbitrary categories of increasing disease burden to the indi-\nvidual. Age, sex and BMI were included as covariates.\nEthnicity was not included in these analyses, due to its limited \navailability in the dataset. The small number of subjects with \nmissing smoking status (n=1313 (0.05%)) were considered non-­\nsmokers. Sensitivity analyses using the same model but including \nethnicity as a covariate and including missing smoking status as \na category in its own right are reported in online supplemental \ntables E1-2. In both analyses, the ORs resulting from the sensi-\ntivity analysis were consistent with those from the primary \nanalysis, thus suggesting that our associations are valid across \ndifferent ethnicities and that treating subjects with missing \nsmoking status as non-­smokers does not affect the association \noutcome.\nSmoking and SARS-CoV-2 PCR result in tested subset\nWe also assessed the association between smoking status and a \npositive SARS-­CoV-2 PCR test outcome using logistic regres-\nsion, including age, sex and BMI as covariates. As a sensitivity \nanalysis, we controlled for confounding effects of healthcare \nworking status on smoking association with SARS-­CoV-2 posi-\ntivity by testing the identical multivariate regression model \nincluding healthcare worker status as a covariate.\nSmoking association with hospital attendance\nUsers of the app who reported that they had symptoms were \nasked to report and then to update their location using the \noptions (i) at home not been to hospital for suspected COVID-19 \nsymptoms, (ii) attending hospital with suspected COVID-19 \nsymptoms, (iii) back from hospital I’d like to tell you about my \ntreatment, (iv) back from hospital I’ve already told you about \nmy treatment. We treated hospital attendance as an additional \nproxy for COVID-19 symptom severity, and therefore tested \n715\nHopkinson NS, et al.

Smoking rates among tested individ-\nuals were lower compared with all users of the app (8.9% vs \n11.0%).\nThe average number of symptoms reported by subjects \nwho reported being tested positive for SARS-­CoV-2 (mean \n(IQR)=6.16 (4–9)), was markedly higher than SC2N users \n(3.22 (2–6); Wilcoxon’s test p<2.22×10−16) and, more impor-\ntantly, than standard users (1.12 (0–1); p<2.22×10−16; online \nsupplemental figure E3). The incidence of all COVID-19-­related \nsymptoms, with the exception of delirium and sore throat, was \nhigher in the SC2P group as compared with the other categories \n(χ2 test p<1.27×10−6; figure 2). Of note, among subjects who \ntested positive for SARS-­CoV-2, current smokers were more \nlikely to develop delirium (OR (95% CI)=1.83 (1.47 to 2.27); \np=4.38×10−8) and abdominal pain (OR=1.43 (1.15 to 1.77); \np=1.07×10−3), compared with non-­smokers.\nSmoking rates were lower in those who had tested positive \nfor SARS-­CoV-2 compared with those testing negative (7.4% vs \n9.3%) as were rates of cancer, heart disease and lung disease. \nIn the tested subpopulation, smoking was negatively associated \nwith the risk of having a positive PCR for SARS-­CoV-2 infec-\ntion (OR (95% CI) 0.73 (0.65 to 0.81); p=9.49×10−9). This \nassociation remained significant when accounting for healthcare \nworking status by including it as covariate in the model (OR \n(95% CI)=0.70 (0.63–0.79); p=6.82×10−10), suggesting that \nthe association between smoking status and SARS-­CoV-2 test \noutcome is not confounded by the higher number of healthcare \nworkers being tested for SARS-­CoV-2 nor the lower smoking \nprevalence among healthcare workers.\nDespite this apparently protective effect of smoking in the \ntested group, the symptom burden was higher in smokers who \ntested positive for SARS-­CoV-2 as compared with non-­smokers. \nSmoking was associated with higher symptom burden in those \ntesting positive (OR (95% CI) of presenting with >10 symp-\ntoms 1.42 (1.09 to 1.83); p=7.13×10−3). In addition, current \nsmokers who tested positive had a higher risk of attending \nhospital due to COVID-19 compared with non-­smokers (OR \n2.11 (1.41 to 3.11); p=1.99×10−4). This association remained \nsignificant when participants reporting the presence of comor-\nbidities were removed from the analysis (OR 1.87 (1.15 to 2.95); \np=9.02×10−3) or when accounting for healthcare working \nstatus by including it as covariate in the model (OR 2.08 (1.37 to \n3.12); p=4.76×10−3).\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding from this large prospective population cohort \nis that current smoking was associated with a substantially \nincreased risk of developing self-­reported symptoms suggestive \nof COVID-19, as well as a greater symptom burden, indicating \nan impact of smoking on disease severity. Among those who \nreported being tested positive for SARS-­CoV-2, smokers had a \nhigher symptom burden and were more likely to need to attend \nhospital, compared with non-­smokers.\nSignificance of findings\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten to overwhelm \nhealthcare systems and measures to contain it impose significant \nburdens on populations.18 19 There is a need for strategies to miti-\ngate this, which include preventing or delaying transmission of \nthe virus to ‘flatten the curve’, as well as any measures that might \nreduce the severity of the condition. In addition, steps should \nbe taken to increase health system capacity and reduce health \nsystem demand from other sources. The present data suggest that \nsmoking cessation should be considered as an element in strate-\ngies to address COVID-19, as smoking increases both the likeli-\nhood of symptomatic disease defined according to the presence \nof ‘classic’ symptoms of fever, cough and breathlessness and the \nseverity of disease, defined based on the number of symptoms. \nCombined with this, a reduction in population smoking rates is \nlikely to reduce the health system burden from other conditions \nthat require hospitalisation such as acute vascular events and \nexacerbations of lung disease10 as well as improving resilience by \nreducing overall sickness absence among key workers.20\nTable 2  OR for individual symptoms in current smokers versus non-­smokers\nN\n(non-­smokers/smokers)\nStandard users\n2 221 088\n(220 135/1 819 505)\nCOVID-19\nself-­reported\n157 406\n(18 845/117 848)\nSARS-­CoV-2\ntested –\n16 759\n(1418/13 902)\nSARS-­CoV-2\ntested +\n7123\n(472/5908)\nSymptom\nOR (95% CI)\nP value\nOR (95% CI)\nP value\nOR (95% CI)\nP value\nOR (95% CI)\nP value\nAbdominal pain\n1.35 (1.33 to 1.38)\n8.35×10–198\n1.43 (1.37 to 1.50)\n7.21×10–57\n1.33 (1.13 to 1.56)\n6.94×10–4\n1.43 (1.15 to 1.77)\n1.07×10–3\nChest pain\n1.16 (1.14 to 1.18)\n1.42×10–63\n1.10 (1.06 to 1.14)\n4.04×10–6\n1.06 (0.92 to 1.23)\n4.06×10–1\n1.31 (1.07 to 1.62)\n1.08×10–2\nDelirium\n1.22 (1.20 to 1.25)\n2.12×10–93\n1.26 (1.20 to 1.31)\n1.08×10–23\n1.60 (1.34 to 1.89)\n8.09×10–8\n1.83 (1.47 to 2.27)\n4.38×10–8\nDiarrhoea\n1.31 (1.29 to 1.33)\n3.94×10–210\n1.28 (1.23 to 1.34)\n5.59×10–29\n1.31 (1.12 to 1.53)\n5.55×10–4\n1.14 (0.92 to 1.40)\n2.34×10–1\nFatigue\n1.06 (1.05 to 1.08)\n1.75×10–15\n0.94 (0.90 to 0.99)\n1.40×10–2\n1.00 (0.84 to 1.18)\n9.55×10–1\n0.78 (0.57 to 1.10)\n1.46×10–1\nFever\n1.01 (0.98 to 1.03)\n6.37×10–1\n1.01 (0.96 to 1.06)\n8.42×10–1\n0.87 (0.74 to 1.02)\n8.79×10–2\n0.86 (0.70 to 1.06)\n1.54×10–1\nHeadache\n1.10 (1.08 to 1.12)\n1.91×10–25\n1.30 (1.24 to 1.36)\n2.77×10–25\n1.03 (0.87 to 1.22)\n7.23×10–1\n1.08 (0.83 to 1.41)\n5.89×10–1\nHoarse voice\n1.06 (1.04 to 1.08)\n8.38×10–8\n1.06 (1.01 to 1.10)\n1.04×10–2\n0.95 (0.81 to 1.12)\n5.48×10–1\n1.19 (0.97 to 1.46)\n1.02×10–1\nAnosmia\n1.07 (1.05 to 1.09)\n6.98×10–11\n0.88 (0.85 to 0.92)\n4.82×10–9\n1.18 (0.99 to 1.39)\n5.55×10–2\n0.93 (0.74 to 1.17)\n5.32×10–1\nPersistent cough\n1.18 (1.16 to 1.20)\n8.28×10–90\n0.99 (0.95 to 1.03)\n5.31×10–1\n0.88 (0.76 to 1.01)\n7.27×10–2\n0.73 (0.59 to 0.90)\n2.96×10–3\nShortness of breath\n1.16 (1.14 to 1.18)\n3.34×10–71\n1.09 (1.05 to 1.14)\n1.40×10–5\n1.11 (0.96 to 1.29)\n1.40×10–1\n1.35 (1.09 to 1.68)\n6.53×10–3\nSkipped meals\n1.76 (1.73 to 1.79)\np<2.23e-308\n1.52 (1.46 to 1.59)\n4.78×10–88\n1.46 (1.26 to 1.70)\n6.92×10–7\n1.31 (1.06 to 1.61)\n1.15×10–2\nSore throat\n0.93 (0.91 to 0.95)\n2.04×10–14\n1.17 (1.12 to 1.23)\n2.00×10–11\n0.90 (0.77 to 1.06)\n2.12×10–1\n1.32 (1.06 to 1.65)\n1.30×10–2\nUnusual muscle pains\n1.47 (1.43 to 1.52)\n2.41×10–151\n1.46 (1.37 to 1.55)\n8.90×10–30\n1.24 (1.02 to 1.50)\n3.18×10–2\n1.19 (0.94 to 1.51)\n1.40×10–1\nFor each test group, the table reports the OR (95% CI) and p value of the association between smoking status and individual COVID-19 symptoms, adjusted for age, sex and BMI.

The increase in \nseverity that we found associated with smoking suggests that the \nwhole curve of disease is shifted as opposed to just the chance \nof infection. Importantly, although the number and degree of \nsymptoms was higher in smokers the pattern of symptoms did \nnot differ importantly, indicating that the phenomenon that we \nobserved was not caused by the presence of symptoms related \ndirectly to smoking itself.\nData were also available for a limited number of individuals \nwho reported the results of swab tests performed to identify the \npresence of SARS-­CoV-2. Only 1% of the study population had \nundergone testing and this group was heavily selected because \nof testing policies which focused on healthcare workers and \nothers interacting with healthcare, in particular, patients tested \nwho may have been attending healthcare settings for other non-­\nCOVID-19-­related conditions. As numerous health conditions \nare smoking-­related, this would tend to increase the exposure \nof smokers without COVID-19 to testing. As a consequence, \nextrapolation from this subgroup to population risk is inap-\npropriate. Smoking prevalence was lower in the tested group \nthan in the whole study cohort, 8.9% vs 11.0%, both values \nsubstantially below the UK population average and smoking \nprevalence was lower in those testing positive than those testing \nnegative (7.4% vs 9.3%). This raises several possibilities. First, \nit may be that smoking does reduce susceptibility to infection \nwith SARS-­CoV-2, although the likelihood of developing symp-\ntoms and severity of disease in current smokers remains higher, \naccording both to the whole population (2.4 million app users) \ndata and the fact that smokers testing positive were more likely \nto report >10 symptoms and to need to have attended hospital. \nOf note, the OPEN-­Safely study which found that in a large \ngeneral practice population, adjusted for age and sex, current \nsmokers had an HR of 1.14 (95% CI 1.05 to1.23) for COVID-\n19-­related death compared with never smokers.7 Alternatively, \nthis finding may represent sampling bias. Among those tested, \na negative PCR result was also associated with a higher rate of \nheart disease, cancer and respiratory disease, all factors associated \nwith worse outcomes in people with COVID-19 but unlikely to \nbe protective against infection. The use of swab testing for PCR \ndiagnosis of viral infection has limitations with a significant false \nnegative rate. It is possible that non-­random differences in the \nway that tests were conducted (eg, nasopharyngeal or oropha-\nryngeal swabs) or the temporal relation of testing to the develop-\nment of symptoms (eg, likely more rapid for healthcare workers) \ncould have influenced results.27 28 In due course, the question of \nrelative infectivity may be answered based either on surveillance \nscreening or widespread antibody testing.\nMethodological issues\nThe triad of ‘classic’ symptoms we used as the primary end \npoint was based on Public Health England guidance. We chose \nthe presence of 5 or 10 symptoms arbitrarily to illustrate the \n‘burden’ of COVID-19 on the basis that a greater number of \nsymptoms was likely to represent more severe illness. All symp-\ntoms were given equal weight. Attending hospital in the context \nof potential COVID-19 was taken as a marker of disease severity. \nOf note, the questions were framed in such a way that hospital \nattendance with symptoms was clearly distinguished from being \nat a hospital because of work.\nThe study uses the presence of self-­reported symptoms to \ndefine the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. Although it \nis possible that some of these represented conditions other than \nCOVID-19, we have previously reported concordance between \nreported symptoms SARS-­CoV-2 test results.14 Additionally, \nwe observe in this larger dataset an increased symptom burden \namong tested positive users compared with both tested negative \nand untested subjects. Importantly, the pattern of correlation \nbetween symptoms did not differ between smokers and non-­\nsmokers suggesting that the increased symptom burden was not \ndirectly related to pre-­existing smoking-­related symptoms.\nBehavioural factors or individual prior expectations and \nbeliefs may have influenced reporting. Thus smokers may have \nfelt themselves to be at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 \nmaking them more likely to report symptoms, thus exaggerating \nthe apparent impact of smoking. Alternatively, non-­smokers \nbeing in general healthier, might be expected to be more sensi-\ntive to changes in their well-­being making them more likely to \nreport symptoms, thus underestimating the impact of smoking.\nParticipants in the study were self-­selected, having chosen \nto register to use the app. In addition, the app was only avail-\nable on a smartphone raising issues of digital access and digital \nliteracy, so caution is needed about extrapolation to the entire \npopulation, in particular older or poorer sections of the popu-\nlation. The overall self-­reported smoking rate among app users \nwas 11.0% and lower in all age and sex strata compared with \nthe general UK population. This may be due to sampling bias, \nreflecting the demographics of this sample, as smoking rates are \nlower in wealthier groups29 who may also have been more likely \nto be able to make use of a smartphone app. Smokers tended to \nreport via the app for a shorter period, with fewer days between \nfirst and last engagement (online supplemental figure E4), which \nmay have led to an underestimate of the effect of smoking on \nthe development of symptoms. In addition, there were relatively \nfewer people in the older age groups who are most susceptible to \nCOVID-19. Smoking status, being based on contemporary self-­\nreport by participants is likely to have been captured more accu-\nrately by the app used in the present study than in studies based \non routine, historical administrative records and those where \nthere is substantial missing data.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated socioeconomic \ninequalities and ethnicity is emerging as a crucial area in its \ndevelopment.7 Unfortunately, ethnicity was not included in the \noriginal set of app registration data. This omission was addressed \nso that this is now being collected, but unfortunately for the \nperiod covered by this analysis it was only available for 12% of \nindividuals. Although in the sensitivity analysis in this subgroup \nour results seem to hold across different ethnicities, further \nexperiments would be needed to better characterise any possible \ninteraction between smoking and symptoms in different ethnic \ngroups. The availability of more detailed socioeconomic data as \nwell as more detailed occupational history would have allowed \n720\nHopkinson NS, et al.

However, in the sensitivity analysis,\nby excluding each study one by one showed that the study from Guan\net al2 was a major source of heterogeneity. After excluding this study,\nthe effect of smoking on the severity of COVID‐19 became insig-\nnificant with the OR of 1.55 (95% CI: 0.83‐ 2.87). The authors\nidentified seven studies2‐8 with data on smoking history and severity\nof COVID‐19. The searching for English and Chinese database was\nup to 22 March 2020.\nIn this letter, the author used the keywords “smoking,”\n“tobacco,” “smoker,” “COVID‐19,” “novel coronavirus,” and “SARS\nCoV‐2” to search PubMed on 16 April 2020. One new study\npublished by Wang et al9 was identified. The updated meta‐analysis\nwas performed by RevMan Ver. 5.3. The pooled OR of the fixed‐\neffect model was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.45‐3.22). The heterogeneity was\nsmaller than that of the original analysis (I2: 39% vs 44%). The\nsensitivity analysis excluding the study from Guan et al2 revealed a\npooled OR of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.10‐3.24) (Figure 1). The heterogeneity\nincreased in the sensitivity analysis (I2 = 48%). The new study from\nWang et al9 contributed a positive effect to the meta‐analysis\n(OR: 3.93, 95% CI: 1.30‐11.93) and resulted in the statistical sig-\nnificance. The study from Guan et al2 contributed to most of the\ncases in the meta‐analysis (1085 out of 1851 cases). By excluding\nthis study, the results were more robust.\nThe possible mechanisms linking smoke to the outcome of\nCOVID‐19 were under study. A recent review10 suggested smokers\nare vulnerable to respiratory infection because of impaired immunity.\nSmoking can upregulate angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 receptor,\nthe known receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS)‐coronavirus, and also possible for SARS‐CoV‐2 causing\nCOVID‐19.\nThe results of the updated meta‐analysis further confirmed the\nimpact of smoking history on the severity of COVID‐19.\nFIGURE 1\nForest plot of the sensitivity analysis of the updated meta‐analysis. 95% CI, confidence interval\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nThe author declares that there is no conflicts of interest.\nFei Ran Guo MD\nDepartment of Family Medicine,\nNational Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine,\nTaipei, Taiwan\nCorrespondence\nFei Ran Guo, MD, Department of Family Medicine,\nNational Taiwan University Hospital,\nNo. 7, Zhongshan South Rd., Taipei City 100, Taiwan.\nEmail: fjguo1@ntu.edu.tw\nORCID\nFei Ran Guo\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0003-0671-9529\nREFERENCES\n1.

Alghamdi\n5,6 and Ahmad S. Almamary5,7\nAs evidence continues to emerge, our understanding of the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 prognosis is steadily\ngrowing. An early outlook from World Health Organisation (WHO) indicates that smokers are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19\ndisease and are also more likely to be infected, as frequent motions from hand to mouth and sharing of tobacco products such as\nwaterpipes increased the possibility of being infected. In this commentary, we discuss some of the latest evidence on smoking and\nCOVID-19 and emphasise the need to promote the personal and public advantages of smoking cessation during the COVID-19\npandemic.\nnpj Primary Care Respiratory Medicine  (2021) 31:22 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41533-021-00238-8\nSMOKING AND COVID-19 RISK\nEvery year, smoking kills >8 million people worldwide. Of such\ndeaths, over 7 million are directly related to cigarettes, and ~1.2\nmillion are attributed to second-hand smoke by non-smokers1. No\ndoubt, that smoking is a major risk factor for most respiratory-\nrelated infections, which raises the severity of respiratory diseases.\nThe early evidence in this area found that compared with non-\nsmokers, smokers are more likely to develop serious COVID-19\ndisease2,3. In a study carried out by Mehra et al.4 of over 8910\nCOVID-19 patients across three continents namely Asia, Europe,\nand North America, current smoking when compared to former or\nnever smoke was an independent risk factor for death at hospital\nwith odds ratio of 1.79 (95% conﬁdence interval: 1.29–2.47).\nIndeed, smoking is heavily contributing to the progression of such\nlong-term diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory5.\nRecently, accumulated evidence from the largest meta‐analysis\namong peer‐reviewed literature that included 32,849 hospitalised\npatients with COVID‐19 found that current smokers had an\nincreased risk of severe COVID‐19 (risk ratios: 1.80; 95% conﬁdence\ninterval: 1.14–2.85)6. Even though smoking might not generally\nraise the risk of contracting COVID-19, it may be particularly\ndebilitating for a smoker if there is a biological and inﬂammatory\ncascade, following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent evidence\nsuggests a low prevalence of active smokers among those\nCOVID-19\npatients\nwho\nneed\nhospital\nadmission\nin\nmany\ncountries severely affected by COVID-19 pandemic7,8. Such\nunderrepresentation of smokers among those patients supported\nclaims that smoking could be protective from COVID-19 infection.\nPossible mechanisms can support this claim: nicotine anti-\ninﬂammatory effect, a blunted immune response in current\nsmokers and potential high nitric oxide in the upper respiratory\nairway, which may prevent replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry\ninto cells9.\nAs scientists get more evidence in this area, more concerns arise\nabout other smoking products, such as vaping. Considering the\nrisks of signiﬁcant pulmonary injury with vaping10, McAlinden\net al. hypothesise that similar risks may happen to COVID-19\npatients who are vaping11. The potential risk of vaping to prime\nthe lung for SARS-CoV-2 is speculative, given that vaping\nprevalence in COVID-19 patients has not been reported. However,\nwhat we know already is that older age groups are the ones more\nlikely to develop severe COVID-19, and according to survey studies\non e-cigarette use in China and the USA, vaping is not prevalent in\nthose of 65 years and older, but popular in younger groups 15–44\nyear age range12,13. Indeed, like smoking, it is likely, if it is not a risk\nfactor for contracting COVID-19, that vaping may also lead to bad\noutcomes.\nWHY SMOKING CAUSES MORE SEVERE COVID-19 CASES\nSeveral hypotheses exist regarding smokers tend to have worse\noutcomes after contracting COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE-2)—the only conﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is a\nvasodilatory protein expressed on the surface of the lung cells and\nserves as the cell-entry receptor for SARS viruses14. Recent\nevidence showed that compared with former and never smokers,\nsmokers were associated with higher ACE-2 expression in a\nvarious cohort of lung tissue and airway epithelium cells15–17. Such\nan observation was further supported by other studies linking\nnicotine exposure, with increased ACE-2 expression18,19. Thus, it\ncould be speculated that the increased ACE-2 expression in\ncurrent smokers may perhaps predispose to increased risk of\nSARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is important to note that to date\nthere is no direct evidence linking increased expression of ACE-2\nto increased susceptibility or severity to COVID-19.\nDespite the high prevalence of smokers in Italy (25.7%), Rossato\net al.20 reported a very low prevalence of smokers in COVID-19\npatients, with no signiﬁcant association between smokers and\nsevere disease in COVID-19 patients. According to Leung et al.21,\nthe potential explanation for this low prevalence could be\nsmoking status misclassiﬁcation due to underreporting of smoking\nin such cohorts or perhaps because of using some medications\nthat may offer some protection against COVID-19. Thus far, there\nis no evidence that smoking protects against COVID-19. Indeed,\nthe speed of events during COVID-19 makes it quite challenging\nto verify the truth from false evidence. Therefore, it is crucial to be\nextremely careful about the messages about smoking and COVID-\n19 in these fragile times. Figure 1 shows the burden of smoking in\nCOVID-19 patients.\n1UCL Respiratory, University College London, London, UK. 2Department of Respiratory Care, Prince Sultan Military College of Health Sciences, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.\n3Respiratory Care Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia. 4UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, London, UK. 5National\nHeart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK. 6Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. 7Respiratory Therapy\nDepartment, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. ✉email: Alqahtani-Jaber@hotmail.com\nwww.nature.com/npjpcrm\nPublished in partnership with Primary Care Respiratory Society UK\n1234567890():,;\nHOW CAN WE SUPPORT SMOKING CESSATION DURING THE\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC?\nWhy smokers should quit?\nWith over 8,000,000 deaths per year due to direct or indirect\nexposure, smoking remains a major global health issue especially\nin low- and middle-income countries. Indeed, in the context of\nCOVID-19, this number is expected to go up, but the time has not\ngone by to quit smoking. With an average light smoker\nconsuming 10–15 cigarette/day, including an average of up to\n13 puffs per cigarette and each puffs duration of 1.5 s (refs. 22,23).\nThis shows that an average smoker has a hand to their mouth\nbetween 130 and 195 times. This translates into 195–293 s more,\nin which the hand is on the lip per day compared with non-\nsmokers. This is especially interesting giving that the SARS-CoV-2\ncan survive on surfaces for days depending on the medium of\nshedding. This provides a possible hypothesis for the increased\nrisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or re-infection in smokers\ncompared to non-smokers. Therefore, both smokers and health-\ncare providers should be aware of this practice behaviour.\nAccording to a recent study, many smokers showed substantial\nlevels of interest expressed in accessing various forms of cessation\nassistance, during COVID-19 compared before COVID-19 (ref. 24).\nThis shows that smokers understand how to reduce the risk of\nCOVID-19 by addressing their smoking. Action on Smoking and\nHealth (Ash) calculates that around a million smokers stopped\nsmoking during COVID-19, an additional 550,000 have attempted\nto quit and 2.4 million have been reduced to smoke cigarettes,\nwhich COVID-19 provided us an unexpected opportunity to help\nmore\npeople\nquit\nsmoking25.\nPut\ntogether,\nthe\nCOVID-19\npandemic and the relative risk of severity linked with smoking\nfurthermore justiﬁes the need for a uniﬁed and global public\nhealth campaign targeted at discouraging direct or indirect\ntobacco exposure around the world.\nHealth and ﬁnancial beneﬁts\nWe highly advocate providing country-speciﬁc, evidence-driven\nsmoking cessation recommendations in public health commu-\nnications focusing on how to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Such\ncessation attempts can provide a variety of advantages within and\nafter the present pandemic, including a reduction in the incidence\nof smoking-related conditions, such as myocardial infarction and\nchronic respiratory conditions, and ultimately reduce the clinical\nchallenge faced by frontline clinicians26–28. On top of that, there\nare personal and healthcare system ﬁnancial savings because of\nsmoking cessation. Smoking has many detrimental consequences\non cardiovascular and respiratory functions, which high-quality\nresearch shows that preoperative reduction of smoking by using\nsmoking cessation interventions can lead to substantial health\nbeneﬁts29. Smoking cessation is a signiﬁcant public health gain at\nany moment. A prospective study included 1.3 million partici-\npants, which resurveyed postally ~3 and 8 years later found that\ntwo-thirds of all deaths of smokers in their 50s, 60s, and 70s are\ncaused by smoking; smokers lose at least 10 years of lifespan30.\nThey also demonstrated that ceasing before age 40 years prevents\n>90% of the additional mortality triggered by continuing smoking;\nquitting before age 30 years avoids >97% of it.\nPolicy and practice\nAt this time during COVID-19 pandemic, it is the right time that\nthe ongoing concern about the COVID-19 outbreak undoubtedly\noffers a ‘learnable window’, when smokers will be exclusively open\nto smoking consultation for smoking cessation. This has been seen\nin a recent study that found the rate of smoking cessation\nincreased from 23% before COVID-19 to 31% during COVID-19\npandemic31. Such health and ﬁnancial beneﬁts are maximised by\npsychological and pharmacological interventions that delivered\nfrom specialist smoking cessation services32. However, smoking\ncessation services should be more resilient and change their\ntraditional delivery models in response to COVID-19 by using\ntelehealth tools, such as expanding telecommunications and\ninteractive assistance capabilities, and allow remote access to\nnicotine replacement products33. Further, promoting tech-driven\napproach by using quitting smoking apps is more beneﬁcial to\nincrease the odds of quitting success. A randomised clinical trial\npublished recently compared the efﬁcacy of two smartphone\napplications for smoking cessation, and found that smokers who\nused the iCanQuit app (teaches acceptance of smoking triggers)\nhad 1.49 times higher odds of quitting smoking compared with\nthose who used the QuitGuide app (depends on avoiding\nsmoking triggers)34. This elevates apps as an effective way of\nquitting smoking, particularly apps that depend on accepting the\nexistence of cravings rather than trying to eliminate them.\nIndeed, using such strategies would reduce the smoking burden\non healthcare systems. A recent study synthesised that best\nhospitals should be required to deliver smoking cessation, and\nsuch a service provision should be considered as a quality\nmeasure for accreditation and recognition35. Furthermore, policy-\nmakers and healthcare providers should consider the information\ndelivery\npreferences\nof\nsmokers\nwhen\ncampaigning\nabout\nsmoking cessation (see Fig. 1). A recent study reported that most\nof the smokers preferred to receive such information through a\ntelevision channel (61%), followed by online news (36%), social\nmedia (31%), and email (31%)24. Indeed, policymakers should\nestablish innovative strategies to increase the uptake to the\nFig. 1\nBurden of smoking in COVID-19 patients and role of\nsmoking cessation. Smoking is associated with increased risk of\nsevere COVID-19 and mortality that are linked with ACE 2\noverexpression and frequent hand to mouth movement. The health\ncost of COVD-19-associated morbidity can be reduced via the\npromotion of smoking cessation through apps, public health\ncampaigns, telehealth models and the hospital quality measures.\nJS Alqahtani et al.\n2\nnpj Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021)  22 \nPublished in partnership with Primary Care Respiratory Society UK\n1234567890():,;\nsmoking cessation therapies, and eventually raise the chances of\nquitting to promote greater patients and system outcomes.\nCONCLUSION\nBeyond the health and ﬁnancial beneﬁts of avoiding tobacco use\nbefore COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in quit rates may help to\nminimise public SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the associated\nseverity with current smokers. Enhancing smoking cessation trials\nduring this pandemic is a clinical priority and should be\nthoroughly endorsed. Smoking cessation with high-quality advice\nusing unconventional approaches during respiratory virus epi-\ndemics, like COVID-19, should be part of public health efforts.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nNo data were generated in the preparation of this manuscript.\nReceived: 8 October 2020; Accepted: 7 April 2021;\nREFERENCES\n1.

The effect of smoking on COVID-19 susceptibility has not \nyet been determined. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between \nsmoking and COVID-19 susceptibility. \nMETHODS This retrospective case-control study was conducted at the quarantine \ncenter of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, \nbetween April and June 2020. A total of 142 adults participated in the study, 73 \nof whom tested positive for COVID-19 and were matched for both sex and age \nwith participants in the control group. Telephone interviews were conducted to \nassess the risk factors associated with that exposure. \nRESULTS Different variables are investigated for their impact on COVID-19 infection \nsusceptibility. The current study’s findings indicated that smokers comprised \nonly 27.5% (n=39) of the participants. There was no association between the \nCOVID-19 swab results and smoking status (χ2=1.857; p=0.395). Furthermore, \nthere was no significant association between any of the smoking parameters and \nsusceptibility to COVID-19, except for the smoking period (t= -2.105, p=0.041). \nThe odds of having a positive swab result among cigarette smokers were lower \nthan those among pipe, waterpipe, and electronic cigarette smokers (OR=0.600; \np=0.394). An association was also observed between COVID-19-positive swab \nresults and contact with an individual with COVID-19 or respiratory disease \n(χ2=79.270 and χ2=18.929, respectively, p≤0.001). \nCONCLUSIONS This study revealed no association between smoking status and \nCOVID-19 swab test results. Further research with a bigger sample size \nis suggested to confirm the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 \nsusceptibility.\nTob. Induc.

It has restricted people’s outings as a management \nmeasure during the pandemic and has led to an increase in the implementation \nof strict hygiene measures. The emergence of this pandemic has motivated a \nlarge proportion of the population to take better care of their health and protect \nthemselves against infections. Nonetheless, this forced some individuals to start \nor increase their smoking habits even though it could be an opportunity to quit \nsmoking because of the restrictive measures implemented.

Dis. 2023;21(January):11\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/156855\n2\nattributed to either increased stress levels or boredom \nelicited by quarantine confinement2.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n(SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, \nuses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-\n2 as a receptor to enter the cells. The association \nbetween the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system \nand COVID-19 infection is unclear. Several systematic \nreviews and meta-analyses have concluded that \npatients with a smoking history are at higher risk \nof severe COVID-193-7. In fact, the risk is increased \nby approximately two times for smokers compared \nto former smokers or non-smokers7. Smoking is \na significant contributor to cardiovascular and \nrespiratory disease8. This can be explained by the \nfact that smoking worsens both viral and bacterial \ninfections by inducing structural and mechanical \nalterations in the respiratory system, and by inducing \ncell- and humoral-mediated immune responses9,10.\nSince COVID-19 is an upper respiratory tract \nillness, we assume smoking habits may make people \nmore susceptible to being infected. Our objective \nwas thus to assess the impact of smoking on the \nCOVID-19 susceptibility of infected quarantined \npersons and compare it with healthy persons in all \nquarantine centers run by Imam Abdulrahman Bin \nFaisal University (IAU) in the Eastern Region of \nSaudi Arabia.\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective matched case-control study \nincluded adult individuals isolated at the IAU \nquarantine centers in Dammam and Alkhobar, Saudi \nArabia, between April and June 2020. This study \nincluded both Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian men and \nwomen aged >18 years with known COVID-19 test \nresults done by Polymerase Chain Reaction testing \nthrough the nasopharynx.\nParticipants’ data were obtained from the medical \ndata of IAU quarantine’s database using a randomized \nsampling procedure, which was developed by the \nDepartment of Health Information Technology for \nquarantine use. Individuals who tested positive for \nCOVID-19 were matched for both age and gender with \nparticipants who tested negative. The interviews were \nconducted by telephone to obtain more information \nabout the demographics, history of contact factors, \ngeneral health status two weeks before admission, \nand smoking status. All participants provided written \ninformed consent upon admission for the study’s use \nof their information. Verbal consent was obtained \nfrom all participants during the telephone interview \nbefore it was initiated. The study’s details were given \nto the participants, including withdrawal instructions \nand assurance of confidentiality.\nA total of 1846 individuals were quarantined, of \nthose 150 tested positive for COVID-19 and were \nmatched with 166 healthy persons who tested \nnegative; the latter constituted the control group. This \nstudy aimed to assess the risk of infection associated \nwith smoking status. We excluded the individuals with \nmissing information or invalid COVID-19 test results. \nOnly 73 of the 150 cases and 69 controls responded \nand agreed to participate. The IAU’s Institutional \nReview Board gave approval for this study (IRB- \nUGS- 2021-01-154) on 6 March 2021 and the study \nconforms with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nTwenty-five patients were initially interviewed to \nevaluate inter-examiner reliability with a Cohen’s \nkappa value of at least 0.7, and were counted as part of \nsample size in the end. The information acquired from \nthe respondents included demographics, such as age, \nsex, marital status, nationality, employment status, \neducation level, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), results \nof COVID-19 test, reason for quarantine, contact with \nindividuals with COVID-19 or any other respiratory \ndisease, and health/smoking status. Smoking status \nquestions asked about whether a person was a current \nor ex-smoker in addition to questions regarding \nsmoking type, age at initiation, duration, and reason \nfor smoking. The Arabic version of the questionnaire \nwas translated and back-translated into English, and \nthe two versions were compared to assess translational \nvalidity.\nThe t-test and chi-squared tests were used for \ndata analysis to compare between the study groups \n(positive- and negative-COVID-19 test results) in \nterms of sociodemographics and smoking status. All \ndata were analyzed using SPSS/STATA version 2711. \nRESULTS\nThe descriptive analysis included 142 participants \nwho volunteered to participate. Almost half of the \nparticipants had COVID-19, with a positive swab test \nresult (n=73; 51.4%) (Table 1).

In terms of education \nlevel, 35.9% (n=51) were high school graduates, while \n30.3% (n=43) held a Bachelor’s degree. Employed \nparticipants comprised 62.7% of the sample (n=89). \nThe BMI ranged 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 (n=51; 35.9%). The \naverage age was 33.46 ± 11.16 years.\nThe main reason for being quarantined was \ninternational arrival (n=85; 59.9%), while the least \ncommon reason was contact with COVID-19-positive \nindividuals (n=2; 1.4%). Among the participants, \n74.6% reported not having any type of contact with \na COVID-19-positive person in the two weeks prior \nto their quarantine (n=106), while 25.4% reported \nthat they had (n=36). In addition, 78.9% reported \nnot having contact with a person with respiratory \nsymptoms two weeks prior to quarantine (n=112), \nwhile 21.2% reported that they had (n=30). Many \nrespondents (n=117; 82.4%) reported having ‘very \ngood’ health status, and only four participants (2.8%) \nreported having either ‘very bad’ or ‘bad’ health status \n(Table 1).\nMore than half of our study participants were \nnon-smokers (n=96; 67.6%), and current smokers \ncomprised only 27.5% (n=39) (Supplementary file \nTable 1). Among those who were current smokers or \nex-smokers, half smoked cigarettes (n=26; 56.5%), \nwhile only 4.3% (n=2) smoked electronic cigarettes \nand almost one-third smoked waterpipes (n=12; \n26.1%).\nThe average age at which the participants started \nsmoking was 21 ± 6 years, and the average period \nof smoking was 11 ± 8 years, from the onset of \nsmoking until the commencement time of the study \n(Supplementary file Table 1). Furthermore, most \nsmokers indicated that they had started smoking as a \ntest (n=29; 63%), 26% of them were imitating their \nfamily or friends (n=12), while 5 (10.9%) because of \nstress or to increase their self-confidence. \nThere was no association between COVID-19 swab \nresults and smoking status (χ2=1.857; p=0.395) \n(Supplementary file Figure 1), smoking type (χ2 \n=0.730; p=0.552), age at the onset of smoking (t= \n-0.363; p=0.718), or the reason for the smoking \ninitiation (χ2=2.313; p=0.378). However, the period \nof smoking significantly influenced swab results (t= \n-2.105; p=0.041) (Supplementary file Figure 2). The \nshorter the smoking period, the higher the likelihood \nthat a participant had a positive COVID-19 swab \nresult (Supplementary file Table 2). \nFurthermore, the crude odds ratio revealed no \nsignificant association between any of the smoking \nparameters and susceptibility to COVID-19. However, \nthe odds of having a positive result if the reason for \nsmoking was stress or increased self-confidence, was \nthree times higher than that of copying smokers \nfrom the family or friends or testing (p=0.318). \nAdditionally, cigarette smokers had lower odds of \nhaving a positive swab result for COVID-19 than pipe, \nwaterpipe, or electronic cigarette smokers (OR=0.600; \np=0.394).\nFurther analysis showed that there was an \nassociation between COVID-19 swab results and \nnationality (χ2=12.389; p=0.001), education level \n(χ2=9.877; p=0.040), quarantine (χ2=93.573; \np=0.001), contact with an individual with COVID-19 \n(χ2=79.270; p=0.001) or an individual who had \na respiratory disease (χ2=18.929; p=0.001), and \nhealth status (χ2=13.898; p=0.008) (Table 1). Other \ndemographic characteristics, including sex, marital \nstatus, employment status, BMI, and age, were not \nsignificantly associated with increased susceptibility \nto COVID-19. \nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined the relationship between smoking \nstatus and likelihood of contracting COVID-19. Other \ndemographic factors were examined to determine \nwhether they were linked to COVID-19. Almost one-\nthird of the study participants were smokers. This \nwas greater than the proportion of current smokers \n(14%) reported by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention in 2019. However, this percentage \ndeclined from 20.9% in 200512. This is in accordance \nwith the trends in the prevalence of tobacco smoking \nreported by the World Health Organization regarding \ntobacco smoking since the beginning of the 21st \ncentury, indicating that smoking rates have been \nsteadily decreasing13. In addition, smoking was \nmore common among men than women (15.3% and \n12.7%, respectively). It was highest among people \naged 25–44 years (16.7%) and 45–64 years (17%). \nFurthermore, people with general education level \ncertificates constituted the highest number (35.3%), \nwhereas those with a graduate degree constituted \nthe lowest number (4%)12. A study conducted in \nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob. Induc. Dis. 2023;21(January):11\nhttps://doi.org/10.18332/tid/156855\n5\nSaudi Arabia in 2010 reported that the proportion \nof smokers ranged from 11.6% to 34.4%. This wide \nrange may be the result of sampling techniques that \ndo not represent the entire population14. \nSmoking has been implicated in several respiratory \ndiseases, including infections15. The inflammatory \nreaction caused by smoke exposure leads to \nimpairment of lung function and inflammation in \npulmonary epithelial cells. This activates TGF-β in \nthe epithelial airway, leading to the release of pro-\ninflammatory mediators by alveolar macrophages to \nfacilitate inflammation and fibrosis16,17. Therefore, \nsmoking has an adverse effect on the immune \nresponse of the respiratory system18. Moreover, \ncigarette smoke can cause further destruction of the \nalveolar wall and lead to mucus hypersecretion by \ninducing the production of inflammatory mediators \nincluding IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. This \nexaggerated immune response leads to the formation \nof reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species19,20. \nIn addition, with the action of proteolytic enzymes, \npulmonary tissue becomes even more damaged21. \nEvidence has shown a significantly increased risk of \nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related \nmortality in smokers compared with non-smokers22. \nAs MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the same \nCoronaviridae family, it can be deduced that smoking \nis a risk factor for COVID-1923-24.\nThe differences between this study’s findings and \nthose mentioned above may be attributed to various \nlimitations and confounders. Some studies that \nhave assessed the relationship between COVID-19 \nand smoking have focused on hospitalized patients, \nthus imposing a limitation on communicating with \npatients in severe and critical conditions. Additionally, \nsocioeconomic status was considered a confounder \nin these studies because hospital access is unequally \navailable to people from different socioeconomic \nbackgrounds. In addition, smoking has respiratory \nand cardiovascular consequences that may overlap \nwith COVID-19 complications10. \nOur study reported a significant correlation \nbetween education level and COVID-19 contraction. \nAccording to a recent study, people with a higher \neducation level are more likely to participate in \nhealthy behaviours25, whereas participants with lower \neducation level believe that they are less susceptible to \ncontracting COVID-19 and are less aware of the risk it \nimplies, and consequently have a higher vulnerability \nto contracting COVID-1926. \nRegarding the history of contact with infected \npeople, we found that it was significantly correlated \nwith positive COVID-19 swab results, irrespective \nof the presence of symptoms. This supports that \nCOVID-19 is transmitted through contact and \nrespiratory transmission27-31. However, these findings \ndiffer from those reported by Tian et al.32 and Chen et \nal.33, in which such a correlation was not found.\nIn addition, this study found no significant relationship \nbetween COVID-19 infection and BMI. This result is \nin accordance with that of a prospective cohort study \ninvolving 89 adolescents, which reported no significant \nrelationship between BMI and cardiorespiratory fitness34. \nIn contrast, obesity is an independent risk factor for \ncontracting COVID-19 as it has a significant impact on \ndisease susceptibility and severity34. \nLimitations\nThis study has a few limitations, including \nunintentional operator bias, where some answers \nwere subjective to the respondents, and recall bias \nduring the smoking questionnaire, which could have \nsignificantly affected the results. The sample size was \nanother limitation; the population of this study was \nrestricted to IAU quarantine residents, resulting in a \nrelatively small sample size that might compromise \nthe generalizability of the results. In addition, even \nthough this study found a correlation between \nsmoking and COVID-19, there is no established causal \nreason for this relationship.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis research showed no significant association \nbetween smoking status and the COVID-19 \nsusceptibility. Other variables, such as contact history \nwith a COVID-19-positive individual and education \nlevel, were associated with increased susceptibility \nto contracting COVID-19. BMI did not significantly \ninfluence susceptibility to COVID-19. It is important \nto note that the current results are applied to positive \ncases with moderate to low risk, excluding hospitalized \nCOVID-19 cases. Further investigations, including \nsystematic reviews, meta-analyses, and larger sample \nsize studies, are needed to draw firm conclusions \nregarding the relationship between smoking and \nCOVID-19 susceptibility.\nResearch Paper\nTobacco Induced Diseases \nTob.

Smokers have higher \nrisk of mortality and have a more severe clinical course. \nThere is paucity of data available on this issue, and a \ndefinitive link between smoking and COVID-19 prognosis \nhas yet to be established.\nMethods  We included 5224 patients with COVID-19 with \nan available smoking history in a multicentre international \nregistry Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19 \n(NCT04334291). Patients were included following an in-­\nhospital admission with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We analysed the \noutcomes of patients with a current or prior history of smoking \ncompared with the non-­smoking group. The primary endpoint \nwas all-­cause in-­hospital death.\nResults  Finally, 5224 patients with COVID-19 with \navailable smoking status were analysed. A total of 3983 \n(67.9%) patients were non-­smokers, 934 (15.9%) were \nformer smokers and 307 (5.2%) were active smokers. \nThe median age was 66 years (IQR 52.0–77.0) and \n58.6% were male. The most frequent comorbidities \nwere hypertension (48.5%) and dyslipidaemia (33.0%). A \nrelevant lung disease was present in 19.4%. In-­hospital \ncomplications such sepsis (23.6%) and embolic events \n(4.3%) occurred more frequently in the smoker group \n(p<0.001 for both). All cause-­death was higher among \nsmokers (active or former smokers) compared with \nnon-­smokers (27.6 vs 18.4%, p<0.001). Following a \nmultivariate analysis, current smoking was considered as \nan independent predictor of mortality (OR 1.77, 95% CI \n1.11 to 2.82, p=0.017) and a combined endpoint of severe \ndisease (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.43, p=0.006).\nConclusion  Smoking has a negative prognostic impact on \npatients hospitalised with COVID-19.\nINTRODUCTION\nCOVID-19 was declared a pandemic on 11 \nMarch 2020 by the WHO.1 COVID-2019 has \na wide spectrum of manifestations ranging \nfrom subclinical infection to acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan \nfailure.2 3 Although some poor prognostic \nfactors have been observed,4 5 its clinical \ncourse remains unpredictable.\nSince pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells \nare one of the targets of SARS-­CoV-2, under-\nlying respiratory risk factors may play a role \nin modifying respiratory response. Available \nfindings regarding smokers are inconsistent, \nand the impact of smoking on SARS-­CoV-2 \ninfection is uncertain.4–7\nA large case series from China reported \na higher prevalence of active smokers in \nsevere COVID-19 infections, in comparison \nto milder cases.4 Nevertheless, some studies \nfailed to demonstrate a link between smoking \nand poorer prognosis of the disease. Even \nsome previous series suggested a theoretical \n‘protective’ effect of smoking habit.7 8 This \nlast hypothesis can be deduced from the \nlower rates of smoking observed in patients \nWhat this paper adds\n►\n►It has been described that a history of smoking is \nassociated with higher rates of mortality and com-\nplications in patients with COVID-19. Contrastingly, it \nhas been suggested that tobacco may have a ‘pro-\ntective’ role in COVID-19 infections.\n►\n►The strengths of this study are the large sample size \nand adjusting for confusion factors to evaluate the \nindependent role of tobacco in the course of SARS-­\nCoV-2 infections. We included former smokers as \nwell in our analysis since both current and former \nsmokers share characteristics and underlying respi-\nratory comorbidities.\n►\n►Main limitations of this study are that some vari-\nables such as packs-­year of smoking or smoke-­free \nyears were not recorded, as well as the bias given \nthe observational nature of the study.\n286\nEspejo-­Paeres C, et al. bmjnph 2021;4:e000269. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000269\n\b\nBMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\nwith COVID-19 in comparison with the general popu-\nlation. The prevalence of smokers among SARS-­CoV-2-­\ninfected patients has been estimated between 1.4% and \n12.5% according to different studies.5–15 These rates \nare notably lower than those recorded in the Chinese \ngeneral population (25.2%).16\nThe pathophysiology of lung damage has not been \nfully understood. It has been suggested that high levels \nof proinflammatory cytokines in serum can induce \nthe hyperinnate inflammatory response. This cascade \nproduces a ‘cytokine release syndrome’ with an over-\nproduction of immune cells and cytokines, which leads \nto an ARDS and septic shock.17–20 Smoking may modu-\nlate the immune response and smokers could present \nan attenuated immune response presenting lower \nlevels of inflammation markers compared with non-­\nsmokers.21 22\nOn the one hand, the ACE2 protein is known to \nplay a role in the infection’s mechanism. The ACE2 \nprotein is expressed on the surface of lung type 2 \npneumocytes and is the principal receptor molecule \nfor SARS-­CoV-2.23–25 On the other hand, some authors \nhave described decreased levels of ACE2 in smokers.26 27 \nConversely, it has been suggested that ACE2 is upregu-\nlated on the airway epithelium of smokers. In a study in \nresected lung specimens, Leung and coworkers found \nan increase of ACE2 gene expression in patients with \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Like-\nwise, a higher ACE2 gene expression was observed in \nsmokers when compared with non-­smoker individ-\nuals.28 29 The question of whether smokers are more \nprone to contract SARS-­CoV-2 infection remains \nunresolved.\nBased on the aforementioned, we aimed to assess if \nsmokers are more likely to die or develop more severe \nforms of COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and population\nWe conducted a cohort study of 5868 consecutive patients \nwho were hospitalised with confirmed or highly suspected \nCOVID-19 infection. Smoking history was available in the \n5224 patients included in the final analysis (figure  1). \nThe patients were entered in the Health Outcome Predic-\ntive Evaluation for COVID-19 Registry (NCT04334291), \na multicentre international registry without conflicts \nof interest, designed as an ambispective cohort. In this \nmulticentre registry, we included the data from 40 centres \nfrom seven countries. From 23 March 2020 to 5 May 2020, \npatients discharged from the hospital (deceased or alive) \nwith COVID-19 diagnosis were included in the registry. \nEpidemiological and clinical data were obtained from \nelectronic medical records, and the data were stored in \nan anonymised fashion.\nDefinitions and study endpoints\nWe assessed the impact of smoking on the prognosis of \n5224 patients with COVID-19. We defined three study \ngroups according to smoking status. Patients were classi-\nfied in active smokers, former smokers and non- smokers. \nWe evaluated the differences in baseline characteristics, \nclinical presentation and treatment, according to these \ngroups. Likewise, we performed an age-­stratified analysis \nof mortality and complications in each smoking group. \nAge groups were divided into quartiles as follows: (1) <52 \nyears old, (2) 52–66 years old, (3) 66–77 years old and (4) \n>77 years old.\nThe primary endpoint was defined as all-­cause in-­hospital \ndeath. A combined secondary endpoint was established as \na composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need \nof prone position or death. Other secondary outcomes \nassessed included in-­hospital complications such as ICU \nadmission, respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, sepsis, \nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and \nembolic events.\nPatient and public involvement\nThe research question and outcome measures were \ninformed according to experience. Due to the pandemic \nsituation, it was not appropriate to involve patients or the \npublic in the design of our research and recruitment to \nor conduct of the study. Results may be disseminated on \nreasonable request.\nStatistical analysis\nThe data are presented as mean (SD) for continuous \nvariables with a normal distribution, median (IQR) for \ncontinuous variables with a non-­normal distribution and \nas frequency (%) for categorical variables. Student’s t-­test \nand the Mann-­Whitney U test were used to compare \ncontinuous variables with normal and non-­normal distri-\nbutions, when needed. The χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test was \nused to compare categorical variables. Univariate analysis \nwas performed for qualitative variables and reported as \nORs with 95% CIs. Given the multiplicity of variables, only \nFigure 1  Study flow diagram.\n287\nEspejo-­Paeres C, et al. bmjnph 2021;4:e000269. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000269\nBMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\b\nfactors with a p value of <0.01 on the mentioned univar-\niate analysis in the smoker cohort were entered into the \nmultivariate analysis (binary logistic regression) to define \nindependent risk factors for the principal outcome and \nfocusing on the smoking status (current, former or \nnever). Mortality analysis was performed using Kaplan-­\nMeier estimates and log-­rank tests to compare factors. \nTwo-­sided p values of <0.05 were accepted as statistically \nsignificant. Likewise, in order to eliminate potential \nconfounding factors, propensity scores for mortality and \nthe combined endpoint were performed. Statistical anal-\nysis was performed using SPSS V. 22.0 and STATA V. 14.0.\nRESULTS\nA total of 5224 patients with COVID-19 were included in \nthis analysis. The majority patients, 3983 (67.9%), were \nnon-­smokers, while 934 (15.9%) were former smokers \nand only 307 (5.2%) were active smokers. Smoking habits \nwere not available in 644 patients (11%); thus, finally, 5224 \npatients were entered in the study (figure 1). The median \nage was 66 years (IQR 52.0–77.0) and 3060 (58.6%) were \nmale. Most individuals were Caucasian (4333, 82.9%) \nfollowed by Hispanic ethnicity (710, 13.6%).\nIn the overall cohort, the most frequent comorbidi-\nties were hypertension (2626, 48.5%) and dyslipidaemia \n(1716, 33.0%). Other conditions included heart disease \n(of any form; 1191, 23%) and obesity (981, 22.1%). A rele-\nvant lung disease was present in 1012 patients (19.4%). \nThe most frequent lung disease was COPD (39.4%) \nfollowed by asthma (26.9%).\nComparing smoking patterns, we found that former \nsmokers were older and had a higher comorbidity burden \ncompared with both active and non-­smoker groups. \nEx-­smokers had higher rates of hypertension (64.3%), \ndyslipidaemia (48.6%) and obesity (30.6%), as well as \na higher prevalence of lung disease (39.3%) and heart \ndisease (38.3%) (p<0.001 for all). Ex-­smokers presented \nthe highest prevalence of COPD (24.6%) compared with \nsmokers (16.3%) and non-­smokers (3%) (p<0.001). \nAsthma was predominantly observed among non-­smokers \n(5.7%). Consequently, cardiovascular medications such as \nACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers, antiplate-\nlets or inhaled beta agonist were more prevalent among \nformer smokers. Differences in baseline characteristics \nand previous treatment are displayed in table 1.\nRegarding clinical manifestations, current smokers \npresented with different symptoms complaining of \nanosmia, dysgeusia and sore throat to a higher degree \nthan the two other groups. The most common symp-\ntoms were fever (73%) and cough (65.6%), whereas \ndyspnoea was less frequently described among smokers. \nIt is worth noting that acute-­phase reactants such as C \nreactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin were \nless frequently elevated in the smoking group, while white \ncell count was higher than in non-­smokers or ex-­smokers. \nClinical presentation and analytical results are described \nin online supplemental table S1.\nThe current smoker group received more beta inter-\nferon but less antibiotics or prophylactic anticoagulation \ncompared with both non-­smoker and ex-­smoker groups \n(p<0.001) (online supplemental table S2). In line with \nthis, in-­hospital complications such as sepsis (23.6%) and \nembolic events (4.3%) occurred more frequently in the \nsmoker group (p<0.001 for both) (online supplemental \ntable S3).\nThe secondary endpoint of ICU admission was greater \namong the active-­smoker group in comparison with \nthe former-­smoker group and the non-­smoker patients \n(p<0.001), while the prone position was more frequently \nused among ex-­smokers (online supplemental table S3).\nIn the univariate analysis, all-­cause death was higher \nin smokers (20.1%) when compared with non-­smokers \n(18.4%) (p<0.001), while the highest mortality was \nobserved among the former-­smoker group (30.0%) \n(p<0.001). Mortality according to age groups is shown in \nfigure 2 and online supplemental table S4.\nThe impact of a smoking history was then compared \nwith the absence of a smoking history. All-­cause in-­hos-\npital mortality and the combined endpoint (ICU admis-\nsion, prone, death) are depicted in online supplemental \ntable S5.\nFollowing this, a multivariate analysis was performed. \nAfter adjusting for confounding factors, current smokers \npresented a greater risk of death from all causes (OR 1.77, \n95% CI 1.11 to 2.82, p=0.017) when compared with non-­\nsmokers. Likewise, former smokers had an increased risk \nof death compared with non-­smokers (OR 1.32 95% CI \n1.0 to 1.73 p=0.049), but this independent risk was not \nas strong as that observed in the current smokers’ group.\nOther independent predictors of mortality were older \nage, hypertension, previous heart disease and elevated \nLDH. Moreover, we performed a multivariate analysis \nfor a combined endpoint of death, ICU admission or \nneed of prone position. As well, the highest risk for the \ncombined endpoint was observed among active smokers \nwhen compared with non-­smokers (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16 \nto 2.43, p=0.006). There were no significant differences \nin the combined endpoint between former smokers and \nnon-­smokers after adjusting for comorbidities (OR 1.09, \n95% CI 0.86 to 1.39, p=0.467). The multivariate analysis is \npresented in the table 2.\nIn online supplemental table S6 propensity scores \nfor mortality and the combined endpoint are depicted. \nIn propensity scores, any kind of smokers (former or \ncurrent) were compared with non-­smokers.\nKaplan-­Meier survival curve for all-­cause mortality is \ndisplayed in figure 3.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main finding in our study was the fact that current \nsmoking was independently associated with a twofold \nincreased risk of mortality compared with non-­smoking, \nafter adjusting for confounding factors in a large interna-\ntional cohort admitted with COVID-19.\n288\nEspejo-­Paeres C, et al. bmjnph 2021;4:e000269. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000269\n\b\nBMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\nAs well, active smokers presented a higher risk for crit-\nical illness (combined endpoint of death, prone position \nand ICU admission) in comparison with non-­smokers \n(1.7-­fold). Interestingly, in spite of the fact that former \nsmokers were sicker, the risk of mortality was not as \nstrong as the risk of current smokers after adjusting for \ncomorbidities.\nAccording to previous series, smoking has been asso-\nciated with higher mortality and complication rates in \npatients with COVID-19.4–7 Our aim was to clarify if the \ndetrimental effect of smoking was independently associ-\nated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 after adjusting for \nother factors.\nSARS-­CoV-2 targets pulmonary alveolar epithelial \ncells and can cause severe pneumonia and respiratory \ndistress.2–5 Thus, underlying respiratory risk factors such \nas previous lung disease or smoking may alter the respi-\nratory response. Some studies have shown that COPD is \nassociated with a worse prognosis of COVID-19.5 15\nThe pathogenesis of acute lung injury remains largely \nunknown. It has been suggested that high levels of proin-\nflammatory cytokines in serum can induce the hyperinnate \ninflammatory response. The hyperinnate inflammatory \nresponse leads to the activation of Th1 cell-­mediated immu-\nnity and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and neutro-\nphils. This cascade produces a ‘cytokine release syndrome’ \nTable 1  Baseline characteristics and previous treatment\nBaseline characteristics\nSmoker (n=307)\nEx-­smoker (n=934)\nNon-­smoker (n=3983)\nP value\nFemale\n95 (30.9)*\n160 (17.1)\n1909 (47.9)*†\n<0.001\nMale\n212 (69.1)\n774 (82.9)†‡\n2074 (52.1)\n  \u0007\nHypertension\n171 (55.9)‡\n597 (64.3)†‡\n1758 (44.2)\n<0.001\nDyslipidaemia\n100 (32.9)\n450 (48.6)†‡\n1166 (29.4)\n<0.001\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\n2 (0.7)\n6 (0.6)\n22 (0.6)\n<0.001\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\n61 (19.9)\n255 (27.3)†‡\n623 (15.6)\n  \u0007\nInsulin therapy\n63 (20.5)\n261 (27.9)†‡\n645 (16.2)\n<0.001\nObesity\n74 (28.1)‡\n228 (30.6)‡\n679 (19.8)\n<0.001\nRenal failure\n30 (9.8)‡\n100 (10.7)‡\n204 (5.1)\n<0.001\nLung disease\n93 (30.3)‡\n367 (39.3)†‡\n552 (13.9)\np<0.001\nAtrial fibrillation\n7 (2.3)\n53 (5.7)†‡\n136 (3.4)\n0.02\nHIV\n6 (2)‡\n6 (0.6)\n8 (0.2)\n<0.001\nHeart disease\n82 (27)‡\n355 (38.3)†‡\n754 (19.1)\n<0.001\nCerebrovascular disease\n17 (5.6)\n104 (11.4)†‡\n277 (7.1)\n  \u0007<0.001\nConnective disease\n12 (4)\n29 (3.2)\n107 (2.7)\n0.389\nLiver disease\n29 (9.6)‡\n56 (6.1)‡\n105 (2.7)\n<0.001\nCancer\n49 (16.2)‡\n210 (22.8)†‡\n431 (11)\n<0.001\nImmunosuppression\n41 (14.4)‡\n99 (11.2)‡\n235 (6.3)\n<0.001\nPartially dependent\n19 (6.2)\n95 (10.2)†\n366 (9.2)\n0.036\nTotally dependent\n4 (1.3)\n40 (4.3)†\n164 (4.1)†\n  \u0007\nHome oxygen therapy\n11 (3.6)\n68 (7.3)†‡\n81 (2.0)\n0.036\nAspirin\n70 (23.3)‡\n239 (26.2)‡\n462 (11.7)\n<0.001\nOther antiplatelet\n17 (5.7)‡\n63 (7.0)‡\n110 (2.8)\n<0.001\nAnticoagulants\n28 (9.3)\n143 (15.7)†‡\n358 (9.1)\n<0.001\nACEI/ARB\n124 (41.5)‡\n447 (48.4)†‡\n1263 (32.0)\n<0.001\nBeta blockers\n69 (23.0)‡\n230 (25.1)‡\n530 (13.4)\n<0.001\nBeta2 agonist\n43 (14.4)‡\n198 (21.8)†‡\n287 (7.3)\n<0.001\nGlucocorticoids\n28 (9.4)\n180 (19.7)†‡\n258 (6.5)\n<0.001\nVitamin D supplement\n36 (12.0)\n113 (12.3)\n401 (10.2)\n0.119\nBenzodiazepines\n55 (18.5)‡\n155 (16.9)‡\n564 (14.3)\n0.027\nValues are n (%).

Likewise, SIRS was less frequently observed in the current \nsmoker group (online supplemental table S3).\nDespite these findings, globally, smoking has detri-\nmental effects on the immune system and infectious \nresponse, and has been associated with a worse prog-\nnosis of pulmonary disease.17 18 Moreover, smokers were \nnoted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-­CoV \noutbreak compared with non-­smokers (37% vs 19%, \nOR=3.14, 95% CI 1.10 to 9.24, n=146).30\nConcerning SARS-­CoV-2 infection, previous studies have \nsuggested that active smokers and former smokers are more \nprone to develop severe COVID-19 infections. Despite the \napparent logical link between smoking and COVID-19 prog-\nnosis, this relationship has not been fully established. In some \nprevious studies, statistical significance was not reached; \nsample sizes were small; and results were not entirely adjusted \nfor other confounding factors.4–7\nReviewing the available previous data, Guan et al \ndescribed clinical characteristics and outcomes of 1099 \npatients with COVID-19 from China. This study reported \na higher prevalence of active-­smokers in severe COVID-19 \n(16.9%) compared with non-­severe disease (11.8%). \nHowever, no statistical analysis for evaluating any associ-\nation was performed.4\nMoreover, Zhao et al conducted a meta-­analysis with 11 \ncase series. They studied the impact of smoking on the \nseverity of COVID-19 among 2002 patients. This study \nconcluded that active smoking increases the risk of severe \nCOVID-19 (fixed effect model, OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.29 to \nFigure 2  All-­cause in-­hospital death according to smoking \nstatus, stratified by age.\nTable 2  Multivariate analysis for in-­hospital mortality and \nfor secondary combined endpoint\nMultivariate analysis for in-­hospital \nmortality\nOR\n95% CI\nP value\nCurrent smoker\n1.77\n1.11 to 2.82\n0.017\nFormer smoker\n1.32\n1.00 to 1.73\n0.049\nAge 52–66 years old\n1.74\n1.10 to 2.79\n0.020\nAge 66–77 years old\n4.56\n2.90 to 7.19\n<0.001\nAge >77 years old\n10.63\n6.78 to 16.66\n<0.001\nHypertension\n1.71\n1.33 to 2.2\n<0.001\nLung disease\n1.06\n0.81 to 1.39\n0.679\nAny cardiac disease\n1.38\n1.08 to 1.76\n0.010\nElevated CRP\n2.11\n1.23 to 3.63\n0.007\nElevated LDH\n2.61\n1.91 to 3.58\n<0.001\nElevated ferritin\n1.22\n0.96 to 1.53\n0.101\n  \u0007\nMultivariate analysis for the \ncomposite endpoint*\nOR\n95% CI\nP value\nCurrent smoker\n1.68\n1.16 to 2.43\n0.006\nFormer smoker\n1.09\n0.86 to 1.39\n0.467\nAge 52–66 years old\n1.33\n1.01 to 1.77\n0.044\nAge 66–77 years old\n1.77\n1.31 to 2.40\n<0.001\nAge >77 years old\n2.64\n1.95 to 3.57\n<0.001\nHypertension\n1.65\n1.35 to 2.03\n<0.001\nLung disease\n1.26\n1.00 to 1.58\n0.054\nAny cardiac disease\n1.53\n1.23 to 1.91\n<0.001\nElevated CRP\n2.27\n1.50 to 3.44\n<0.001\nElevated LDH\n2.16\n1.70 to 2.75\n<0.001\nElevated ferritin\n1.61\n1.32 to 1.96\n<0.001\nStatistically significant p value: p <0.05.\n*Composite endpoint of intensive care unit admission, prone \nposition or death.\nCI, Confidence interval; CRP, C reactive protein; LDH, lactate \ndehydrogenase.\nFigure 3  Kaplan-­Meier survival curve free from all-­cause \ndeath, according to smoking status.\n290\nEspejo-­Paeres C, et al. bmjnph 2021;4:e000269. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000269\n\b\nBMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\n3.05) by around twofold.5 Results were heavily influenced \nby one study4 and after removing it from analysis, associ-\nation was not reached with the OR of 1.55 (95% CI 0.83 \nto 2.87).5\nIn a similar fashion, Liu et al studied 78 patients with \nCOVID-19. They found a higher proportion of smokers \n(27.3%) among adverse outcome group, compared with \nthe group that showed improvement or stabilisation \n(3.0%) (p=0.018). In their multivariate logistic regression \nanalysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease \nprogression (OR=14.28, 95% CI 1.58 to 25.00, p=0.018).6\nFurthermore, in a meta-­analysis conducted by Patanav-\nanich and Glantz, a total of 11 590 patients with COVID-19 \nfrom 19 studies were included. In the overall cohort, \n18.4% of the patients developed disease progression. \nAfterwards, results between smokers and non-­smokers \nwere compared. Smokers presented a higher rate of \ndisease progression (29.8%) in contrast with non-­smokers \n(17.6%) with a twofold increased risk for smokers (OR \n1.91, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.59, p=0.01).31\nIn our cohort, pernicious effects of smoking have \nbeen observed by the finding of a relationship between \nsmoking and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. \nMortality was significantly higher among patients with a \nsmoking history (both former and current) than in the \nnon-­smoker group (27.6 vs 18.4%, p<0.001). Likewise, a \nmore severe disease was associated to both present and \npast smoking history (composite endpoint: 36.2 vs 26.1%, \np<0.001; online supplemental table S5).\nOur results are in line with those found in a meta-­analysis \nconducted by Jiménez-­Ruiz et al. This study analysed data \nfrom 34 studies including a total of 6487 patients with \nSARS-­CoV-2 infections. This meta-­analysis showed a worse \nclinical course in current and former smokers (OR 1.96, \n95% CI 1.36 to 2.83), as well as a greater risk of critical \nillness (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.70), when compared \nwith non-­smokers.32\nMoreover, Lowe et al evaluated the association between \ncumulative smoking exposure, as measured by pack-­years, \nwith COVID-19 outcomes. They studied a cohort of 7102 \npatients recovered in Cleveland Clinic who tested posi-\ntive for COVID-19. Eighty-­five per cent (6020) of them \nwere non-­smokers; 2.4% (172) were current smokers; and \n12.8% (910) were former smokers. As well, they compared \nnon-­smokers with patients smoking 0–10, 10–30 and \nmore than 30 pack-­years, respectively. They found an \nassociation between the risk of bad outcomes and the \nnumber of pack-­years, with a 1.89 and 2.25-­fold increased \nrisk of mortality and hospitalisation, respectively, among \nthose patients smoking more than 30 pack-­years. This \nrelationship was dose-­dependent with a progressive incre-\nment of risk according to the number of pack-­years. They \nconclude that smoking is an independent risk factor for \nhospital admission and mortality in COVID-19.33\nLikewise, a meta-­analysis conducted by Vardavas \nreviewed five studies on COVID-19. All studies included \npatients’ smoking status with sample sizes ranging from \n41 to 1099 patients. In all these studies, there was a higher \nprevalence of both current and former smokers among \nmore severe cases (patients who needed ICU support, \nmechanical ventilation or who had died; relative risk \n(RR): 2.4, IQR 1.43–4.04).34\nAnother retrospective study conducted by Adrish et al \nanalysed 1173 patients with COVID-19 and smoking habit \navailable. Among them, 837 patients never smoked while \n336 were either current or past smokers. In this anal-\nysis, smokers developed more critical illness requiring \nmechanical ventilation (47% vs 37% p=0.005). Univariate \nCox model for survival showed that only current smokers \nhad higher risk of death compared with never smokers \n(HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.12, p<0.001).35\nIn our cohort, to clarify if the impact of smoking on \nCOVID-19 outcome is rather linked to the smoking-­\nrelated comorbidities, a multivariate logistic regression \nanalysis was performed. After adjusting by confounding \nfactors, mortality and severity (defined as the composite \nendpoint) were still higher among smokers compared \nwith never smokers (multivariate analysis in table  2). \nIndeed, one of the most interesting findings in this work \nis the fact that active smokers, even if they presented \nless comorbidities than former smokers, presented the \ngreatest risk of mortality and severity, once confounding \nfactors were adjusted. Current smoking was found to be \nan independent predictor of mortality and poor prog-\nnosis in COVID-19. Former smokers presented a slightly \nincreased risk of mortality (1.3-­fold), but there were \nno statistically significant differences for the combined \nendpoint in contrast with non-­smokers.\nIn our study, ex-­smokers had a greater burden of comor-\nbidities compared with the other two groups. It might \nexplain a higher crude mortality rate among ex-­smokers \nin comparison with active smokers.\nUnlike our cohort, other studies did not include \nex-­smokers in their analysis.9 It is worth highlighting the \nimportance of including ex-­smokers, since both current \nand former smokers share characteristics and underlying \nrespiratory comorbidities. Moreover, both groups have \na similar expression of ACE2 receptors. Cai observed \na higher ACE2 gene expression in the airway epithelia \nof healthy patients with a current or previous history of \nsmoking compared with non-­smokers.28\nContrastingly, it has been widely questioned whether \na history of smoking contributes to an increased risk \nof contracting COVID-19. An important mechanism \nof SARS-­COV2 infection relates to the levels of ACE \n2 proteins that are produced. While the hyperinnate \ninflammatory response is mainly related to the clinical \ncourse of the disease, this second mechanism may play a \nrole in the susceptibility to infection. The ACE2 protein \nis expressed on the surface of lung type 2 pneumocytes \nand is the principal receptor molecule for SARS-­CoV-2. \nSome authors have described decreased levels of ACE2 in \nsmokers,26 27 which proposes a protective role of smoking. \nThis mechanism suggests that in the ACE/ANG II/\nAT1R arm, nicotine increases the expression and activity \nof renin, ACE and AT1R, whereas in the compensatory \n291\nEspejo-­Paeres C, et al. bmjnph 2021;4:e000269. doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000269\nBMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health\b\nACE2/ANG-(1–7)/MasR arm, nicotine downregulates \nthe expression and activity of ACE2 and AT2R, thus \nsuggesting a possible contribution of acetylcholine recep-\ntors in ACE2 regulation (nicotine).27\nA theoretical ‘protective’ role of tobacco in COVID-19 \ninfection has been suggested. It is worth noting the lower \nrates of smoking observed in patients with COVID-19 in \ncomparison with the general population. This may indi-\ncate a lower susceptibility to the infection in individuals \nwith a smoking history.\nPrevious Chinese studies have shown low rates of \ncurrent smokers among SARS-­CoV-2-­infected patients \n(1.4%–12.5%),5–15 lower than the reported prevalence \nof smoking in China (25.2%).16 Moreover, possible \nselection biases need to be considered. It is remarkable \nthe median age of patients ranged from 38 to 59.7 years \nin the previously mentioned series.6 9–14 These ages are \nstrikingly lower than expected results and differ notably \nfrom our cohort with a median age of 66 years (IQR \n52.0–77.0).\nSimilarly, Miyara et al studied 482 patients with \nCOVID-19 to evaluate smoker’s susceptibility to develop \nSARS-­CoV-2 infection. In their cohort, 4.4% of the \nhospitalised patients and 5.3% of outpatients were \ndaily smokers. Finally, they compared these results with \nthe French general population (daily smokers’ rate \nof 25.4%). An increased susceptibility to SARS-­COV2 \ninfection in smokers was suggested.8\nSince our study population is predominantly Spanish, \nwe reviewed data regarding current smokers in Spain. \nThese data have been reported by the Instituto Nacional \nde Estadística in 2017. The survey involved 29 195 indi-\nviduals interviewed between October 2016 and October \n2017. They were classified in daily smokers, occasional \nsmokers, former smokers and non-­smokers. Smoking \nprevalence in 2017 among men was approximately \n25.6% and 18.8% in women. It is worth pointing out \nthat these rates are notably higher than the smoking \nrates recorded in our Spanish cohort (5%). Although \nthis imbalance draws attention, it should be considered \nthat smoking status has been assessed only in hospital-\nised patients with COVID-19, thus symptomatic individ-\nuals fulfilling admission criteria. Since most COVID-19 \nstudies have been performed in symptomatic patients, \nthe smokers’ lower susceptibility to have COVID-19 \ninfection cannot be extrapolated from these data. More-\nover, considering ex-­smokers, the prevalence of current \nand former smokers reaches 21% in our cohort. This \npercentage approaches those observed in the general \npopulation.\nConversely, it has been suggested that ACE2 is upreg-\nulated in the airway epithelium of smokers.23 As previ-\nously stated, increased levels of ACE2 gene expression \nhave been reported in samples taken from smokers in \ncomparison with non-­smokers28; thus, smokers may be \nmore susceptible to SARS-­CoV-2 infection. Similarly, in \na study in resected lung specimens, Leung et al found an \nincreased rate of ACE2 gene expression in smokers.29\nIt remains to be seen if smokers are more prone to \ncontracting SARS-­CoV-2. Despite its relevance, the \ncurrent data do not answer this question. It is also worth \nnoting that the true prevalence of COVID-19 infection \nrates in the general population is likely underestimated.\nLimitations\nIn our study, only hospitalised patients with COVID-19 \nwere evaluated; therefore, it is clear that these patients \nhad a more severe clinical course.\nMoreover, as this study is an observational study, there \nis the potential for bias, given the nature of the study \ndesign. It must be considered that many individuals may \nbe asymptomatic, and it is not currently possible to estab-\nlish the real prevalence of smoking among all COVID-19 \ncases.\nFurthermore, another limitation of our study was the \nfact that the number of pack-­years of smoking was not \nrecorded in our database and, therefore, it was not \npossible to classify the patients following this interesting \ncriterion. Likewise, the number smoke-­free years was not \navailable, which would have provided a more accurate \nclassification of previous risk in former smokers.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, current smoking has a detrimental impact \non COVID-19 prognosis. A history of active smoking is \nrelated to worse COVID-19 outcomes, with increased \nrisk of mortality and the combined event, after adjusting \nfor comorbidities. Likewise, a greater risk of mortality \nwas still found among former smokers, compared with \nnon-­smokers.\nAuthor affiliations\n1Cardiology, Hospital Clinico Universitario San Carlos Instituto Cardiovascular, \nMadrid, Spain\n2Cardiology/Internal Medicine, Hospital Clinico Universitario San Carlos Instituto \nCardiovascular, Madrid, Spain\n3Cardiology, University Hospital of Santiago de Compostela.

However, few studies have examined how these messages aﬀect attitudes, beliefs, and \nbehavioral intentions of people who smoke. These are critical variables that can inform public health campaigns \nto motivate quitting smoking during the COVID-19 crisis. \nMethods: In August 2020, we conducted an online experiment in the U.S. with 1,004 adults who smoke. Par- \nticipants were randomized to one of four message conditions: COVID-19 risk, smoking risk, combined risk of \nsmoking for COVID-19 severity, or a non-risk control. Outcomes were message reactions (emotions and reac- \ntance), attitudes and beliefs (severity, susceptibility, self-eﬃcacy, response eﬃcacy for smoking and COVID- \n19, and conspiracy beliefs), and behavioral intentions (smoking intentions, COVID-protective intentions, and \ninformation-seeking). \nResults: Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed that combined risk messages elicited higher \nperceived severity of smoking-related disease than control messages. Similarly, the combined risk condition re- \nsulted in greater intentions to quit smoking in the next month (vs. COVID-19 risk condition) and intentions to \nreduce smoking in the next 6 months (vs. smoking risk and control; ps < .05). Multivariate logistic regression \nfound that exposure to the combined risk messages (vs. control as referent) was associated with higher odds of \nmask-wearing intentions in the next 2 weeks (AOR = 1.97). \nConclusions: Health agencies can possibly use messages that communicate about the combined risk of smoking \nand COVID-19 as a novel strategy to motivate people who smoke to quit and take protective action for COVID-19. \nIntroduction \nThe novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has \ncaused widespread sickness and death ( Johns Hopkins University & \nMedicine, 2021 ). A growing body of evidence has shown that smok- \ning cigarettes increases the severity of COVID-19 ( Gülsen et al., 2020 ; \nKaranasos et al., 2020 ; Patanavanich & Glantz, 2020 ; Reddy et al., \n2021 ; Zhao et al., 2020 ) and governmental and public health agen- \ncies, such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease \nControl, and the World Health Organization, have designated smoking \na risk factor for COVID-19 ( Centers for Disease Control and Preven- \ntion, 2021 ; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2021 ; World Health \nOrganization, 2020 ). Emerging studies show a spectrum of awareness \namong people who smoke on the greater severity of COVID-19 for them, \nwith some (particularly those in the process of quitting) being highly \n∗ Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: lpopova1@gsu.edu (L. Popova). \ncognizant of the increased severity and some reporting not having heard \nof it ( Popova et al., 2021 ; Rigotti et al., 2021 ). \nAwareness about the increased severity of COVID-19 for people \nwho smoke has been associated with greater smoking quit intentions \nin cross-sectional research ( Elling et al., 2020 ; Klemperer et al., 2020 ; \nKowitt et al., 2020 ). However, it is unclear how exposure to such \ninformation might aﬀect emotional and cognitive responses and be- \nhavioral intentions of people who smoke. Few studies have tested re- \nactions to messages about the risk of smoking for COVID-19 sever- \nity. Grummon et al. (2020) exposed people who smoke and/or use e- \ncigarettes to messages about the risk of smoking (or e-cigarette use) for \nworsened COVID-19 outcomes presented as tweets from the Centers for \nDisease Control. Compared to the control messages (generic information \nabout cigarettes), messages containing smoking risk or risk of increased \nseverity of COVID-19 produced higher scores on perceived message ef- \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103607 \n0955-3959/© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the study \nprimarily focused on perceived message eﬀectiveness and did not mea- \nsure outcomes related to quitting smoking or protecting against COVID- \n19. Pettigrew et al. (2021) tested four messages for smoking cessation \n(two were COVID-focused, one was on respiratory health, and one was \nﬁnancially focused) and found that exposure to COVID messages sig- \nniﬁcantly increased intentions to quit smoking, compared to the other \nmessages. This study was conducted with participants from Australia, \nNew Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and thus testing still needs to \nbe done in the U.S. \nThere have been calls for more research to understand how media \nexposure about the risks of smoking for COVID-19 impacts people who \nsmoke ( Berlin et al., 2020 ; Eisenberg & Eisenberg, 2020 ; Popova, 2020 ). \nTo heed these calls, we tested the eﬀects of messages about smoking and \nCOVID-19 risks, with the risks presented separately and together. Based \non past research ( Francis et al., 2019 ; Yang & Popova, 2019 ), the mes- \nsage impact framework informed our selection of outcomes ( Noar et al., \n2016 ). The message impact framework argues that message charac- \nteristics inﬂuence receivers’ reactions to warnings (e.g., emotions), af- \nfecting attitudes and beliefs, and behavioral intentions ( Noar et al., \n2016 ). These individual outcomes (message reactions, attitudes and \nbeliefs, and intentions) are theorized to be predictors of behavioral \nchange ( Noar et al., 2016 ). Evaluating antecedents to behavioral change \nis important to understand how health communication interventions \nmight impact consumer behaviors. Thus, the message impact framework \nguided our study as we evaluated message reactions, attitudes and be- \nliefs, and behavioral intentions after exposure to risk messages. \nOur research question sought to understand how exposure to mes- \nsages about risks of smoking and/or COVID-19 might aﬀect participants’ \nmessage reactions, attitudes and beliefs, and behavioral intentions about \nquitting smoking and protecting against COVID-19. These outcomes \nwere assessed in an online experiment where adults who smoke were \nrandomly assigned to diﬀerent risk messages about smoking and COVID- \n19 to evaluate the exposure eﬀects of the risks presented together and \nseparately. \nMethods \nParticipants \nIn August 2020, a convenience sample of 1,004 U.S. adults (18 + \nyears old) who currently smoke were recruited by the market research \ncompany Toluna ( www.toluna-group.com ). Although not a representa- \ntive survey, participants were invited to participate based on quotas on \ngender, age, education, race, and income categories that approximate \nthe distributions in the national population. In calculating the sample \nsize, we estimated the ﬁnal sample we needed (200 participants per con- \ndition, 1,000 total), and the research company recruited the participants \nuntil that number was reached. Toluna uses multiple online strategies \n(e.g., web banners, website referrals, aﬃliate marketing) to recruit eligi- \nble participants for research. Inclusion criteria for the study were being \n18 years old or older, having smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime \nand currently smoking cigarettes every day or some days, and being \nable and willing to participate in study conducted in English. All par- \nticipants completed an electronic informed consent. The Georgia State \nUniversity Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. \nProcedure and design \nWe conducted a pilot test with 100 participants to test the feasibil- \nity and readability of the questionnaire. The study was an online ex- \nperiment administered through the Toluna system. After consenting, \nparticipants reported their demographics and answered pretest ques- \ntions about smoking quit intentions, health status, and previously hav- \ning COVID-19. Participants were then randomized to one of four con- \nditions: (1) COVID-19 risk, (2) smoking risk, (3) combined risk (i.e., \nsmoking increases COVID-19 severity), and (4) control. To prevent case- \ncategory confounding issues ( Jackson et al., 2006 ), each condition had \nﬁve messages, and participants were randomly exposed to one of the ﬁve \nmessages in each condition. After viewing the message, participants re- \nsponded to the outcome measures (detailed below and in Table 1 ). They \nwere also asked to report how many people they knew who had COVID- \n19 and if they had heard about the risk of COVID-19 for smokers before \nparticipating in the study. Finally, participants were debriefed that the \nmessages they had seen were used for research purposes only and had \nnot been approved by any public health or federal agency, shown in- \nformation about the increased severity of COVID-19 for tobacco users \n( Stanford Medicine Tobacco Prevention, 2020 ), and provided with a \nsmoking quitline number and links to smoking cessation websites. \nMessage stimuli \nWe created the experimental stimuli (e.g., messages) by adopting \ncontent from news stories (e.g., ABC, New York Times , and Fox News ) and \neducational campaigns about smoking risks ( Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, 2016 ). Each message was formatted like an online news \nstory and had a headline, a color photo, and was approximately 150 to \n250 words in length. No references to any speciﬁc journalists or news \noutlets were included to prevent possible confounding eﬀects of message \ncredibility. Messages in the COVID-19 risk condition focused on disease \nprogression (lung failure, heart damage, and death). Messages in the \nsmoking risk condition described negative health impacts of smoking \n(lung and heart disease, cancer, and death). The combined risk condition \ndescribed how smoking makes COVID-19 worse. The control condition \nshowed non-risk messages (e.g., facts about whales). \nAll messages in the risk conditions ended with an eﬃcacy paragraph \nemphasizing possible ways to deal with described risks, including quit- \nting smoking, engaging in COVID-protective behaviors —or both. Eﬃ- \ncacy is a key factor inﬂuencing how message receivers respond to fear \nappeals ( Witte, 1994 ). Arousing fear without eliciting eﬃcacy to deal \nwith the risk can lead to rejection of the warning message, possibly \nharming public health ( Ruiter et al., 2014 ). Therefore, we included a \nbrief eﬃcacy component with each risk message (see Figure 1 for exam- \nple messages; see supplemental materials for all study messages). \nKey measures \nBased on the message impact framework, we assessed three sets of \noutcomes (full deﬁnitions provided in Table 1 ). \n1. Message \nreactions : \nnegative \nand \npositive \nemotions \n( Nonnemaker et al., 2010 ; Popova et al., 2018 ) and psychological \nreactance ( Hall et al., 2017 ). \n2. Attitudes and beliefs : susceptibility and severity (for smoking- \nrelated disease and COVID-19 each), self-eﬃcacy and response ef- \nﬁcacy (for smoking and COVID-19 each; El-Toukhy, 2015 ) and \nCOVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( Imhoﬀ& Lamberty, 2020 ). \n3. Behavioral intentions : smoking quit intentions next 1 month \n( Carpenter et al., 2003 ), smoking intentions next 6 months ( Wong & \nCappella, 2009 ), COVID-19 information-seeking intentions ( Kelly & \nHornik, 2016 ; Shim et al., 2006 ), COVID-protective intentions next \n2 weeks ( Mays et al., 2016 ; Yang & Popova, 2019 ). \nCovariates \nAs possible covariates, we used standard demographic measures: \ngender (male vs. female), age, race (white vs. non-white), and educa- \ntion (high school or less vs. other). We also included other measures \nthat might be predictive of our outcomes: smoking quit intentions at \npretest (dichotomized into 1 = Never expect to quit / May quit in the fu- \nture, but not in the next 6 months vs. 2 = Will quit in the next 6 months / Will \nquit in the next month / Currently trying to quit ); self-reported health status \n2 \nZ.B.

Example images and text for the experimental message conditions. \nat pretest (range: 1 = poor to 5 = excellent ) and self-reported COVID-19 \nstatus ( never had vs. had or suspected to have) at pretest. Having known \nsomeone with COVID-19 ( 0 people or don’t know vs. know 1-10 or more ) \nor heard about increased risks of COVID-19 for smokers ( heard nothing \nvs. heard about increased risks ) was assessed after message exposure. \nAnalysis plan \nWe ran three MANCOVA models with message conditions (COVID- \n19 risk, smoking risk, combined risk, and control) entered as the in- \ndependent variable and outcomes from sets 1-3 as dependent vari- \nables. To identify covariates for analyses, we followed the criterion of \nPocock et al. (2002) and only included covariates that correlated with \ndependent variables at r ≥ .3. The ﬁrst MANCOVA model tested set \n1 message reactions (i.e., positive and negative emotions and psycho- \nlogical reactance) using health status as a covariate. The second MAN- \nCOVA tested set 2 attitudes and beliefs (i.e., severity, susceptibility, self- \neﬃcacy, response eﬃcacy for smoking and COVID-19, and COVID-19 \nconspiracy beliefs), adjusting for pretest smoking quit intentions and \nhealth status. The third MANCOVA tested set 3 behavioral intentions \n(i.e., smoking intentions, COVID-protective intentions, and COVID-19 \ninformation-seeking intentions) using pretest smoking quit intentions \nand health status as covariates. Bonferroni correction was used to assess \nmultiple comparisons in MANCOVA models. We ran three multivari- \nate logistic regression models since the COVID-protective intention out- \ncomes in set 3 were dichotomous (see Tables 1 and 4 for scoring info). \nThe adjusted regression models used pretest smoking quit intentions, \nhealth status, and condition (with control as the referent) as predictors \non intentions to wear masks, wash hands, and social distance in the \nnext 2 weeks ( Table 4 ). Signiﬁcance levels for all tests were p < .05. All \nanalyses were conducted with SPSS 27. \nResults \nParticipant characteristics are shown in Table 2 . The sample \n( N = 1,004) was 18-79 years old ( M = 40.56 years, SD = 15.01) adults \nwho currently smoked every day or some days, 50.1% identiﬁed as male, \n67.0% as White, and 36.8% as having high a school degree or less. The \nlargest group for self-reported health status was “good ” (32.2%), and the \nlargest group for pretest smoking quit intentions was “may quit smok- \ning, but not in the next 6 months ” (43.8%). A minority of participants \nthought they had COVID-19 (16.5%) in the past, although most knew \nsomeone who had COVID-19 (55.7%) and had heard about the risks of \nCOVID-19 for smokers (81.6%). \nSet 1: message reactions \nIn the MANCOVA, the multivariate eﬀect of condition was signif- \nicant, Wilks’ Λ = .72, F (9, 2427) = 38.27, p < .001, η2 \np = .10. The \nunivariate eﬀect of condition was signiﬁcant for negative emotions \n( F [3, 999] = 71.87, p < .001, η2 \np = .18) and positive emotions ( F [3, \n999] = 23.07, p < .001, η2 \np = .07). Pairwise comparisons showed neg- \native emotions were signiﬁcantly higher in every risk condition versus \nthe control. Positive emotions were higher in the control than all risk \nconditions (see Table 3 for all MANCOVA results). Reactance was not \nsigniﬁcant at the univariate level or for diﬀerences in pairwise compar- \nisons between conditions. \nSet 2: attitudes and beliefs \nMultivariate eﬀect of condition was signiﬁcant, Wilks’ Λ = .96, F (30, \n2904) = 1.54, p < .05, η2 \np = .02.

The univariate eﬀect of condi- \ntion was signiﬁcant for smoking quit intentions in the next 1 month \n( F [3, 998] = 3.43, p < .05, η2 \np = .01) and intentions to reduce smoking \nin the next 6 months, ( F [3, 998] = 3.54, p < .05, η2 \np = .01). Pairwise \ncomparisons showed smoking quit intentions in the next 1 month were \nsigniﬁcantly higher in the combined risk condition than the COVID-19 \nrisk condition .Intentions to reduce the number of cigarettes in the next \n6 months were signiﬁcantly higher in the combined risk condition than \nthe smoking risk and control conditions. The other smoking intentions \n(i.e., seek counseling and use NRT) and information-seeking intentions \nwere non-signiﬁcant at the univariate level and were not signiﬁcantly \ndiﬀerent in pairwise comparisons between conditions. \nSet 3: logistic regression results with COVID-protective intentions \nWe ran separate logistic regression models for each of the three di- \nchotomous COVID-protective intentions (wear mask, wash hands, so- \ncial distance) with condition (control as the referent), pretest smoking \nquit intentions, and health status as predictors (see Table 4 ). In the \nﬁrst model with mask-wearing intentions as the outcome, exposure to \nthe combined risk condition (vs. control as referent) predicted mask- \nwearing intentions (AOR = 1.97, p < .05) as did pretest smoking quit \nintentions (AOR = 1.78, p < .01), with intentions to quit smoking in the \nnear future associated with greater odds of mask-wearing intentions in \nthe next 2 weeks. In the second model, health status predicted hand- \nwashing intentions (AOR = 0.67, p < .01) with higher scores on health \nstatus associated with lower odds of hand-washing intentions in the next \n2-weeks. No predictors were signiﬁcant in the third regression model for \nthe social distancing outcome. \n5 \nZ.B. Massey, H.T. Duong, V.

Results showed that exposure to the combined \nrisk messages elicited higher perceived severity of smoking-related dis- \nease than the control messages. Similarly, the combined risk condition \nresulted in greater intentions to quit smoking in the next 1 month (vs. \nCOVID-19 risk condition) and intentions to reduce smoking in the next 6 \nmonths (vs. smoking risk and control conditions). In addition, exposure \nto the combined risk messages (vs. control) predicted greater likelihood \nof mask-wearing intentions in the next 2 weeks. Finally, each risk condi- \ntion resulted in greater negative emotions and lesser positive emotions \nthan the control condition. These results add evidence to earlier work \ntesting smoking and COVID-19 health messages ( Grummon et al., 2020 ; \nPettigrew et al., 2021 ) and inform public health communication and \n6 \nZ.B. Massey, H.T. Duong, V. Churchill et al. \nInternational Journal of Drug Policy 102 (2022) 103607 \npolicy during the COVID-19 crisis, especially regarding novel strategies \nfor motivating smoking cessation. \nOur results add to the literature by assessing the eﬀects of messages \nabout the combined risk of smoking for COVID-19 severity on smoking \noutcomes. Exposure to the combined risk messages led to higher inten- \ntions to quit smoking in the next month (vs. COVID-19 risk) and reduce \nsmoking in the next 6 months (vs. smoking risk and non-risk control). \nThese results conﬁrm and add to research where people who smoke \nperceived combined risk messages as more eﬀective at discouraging \nsmoking than generic messages ( Grummon et al., 2020 ; Pettigrew et al., \n2021 ). \nDescribing the risk of smoking for COVID-19 severity could inform \nhealth campaigns aimed at people who smoke. For example. U.S. agen- \ncies like the Centers for Disease Control are actively messaging on the \nrisks of smoking for COVID-19 severity by recommending that people \nwho smoke quit ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021 ). \nWhile the eﬃcacy of such appeals is unknown —and a topic of future \nresearch —our results suggest combining risks of smoking for COVID-19 \nseverity can enhance smoking quit intentions, which are theorized to in- \nﬂuence smoking behaviors ( Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011 ; Noar et al., 2016 ). \nAlthough our study did not capture smoking behaviors, our results high- \nlight a novel strategy for public health and tobacco control messages \npromoting smoking cessation through the threat of COVID-19. \nMessages about more severe COVID-19 for people who smoke can be \ntargeted at people who smoke and at the general public for two reasons. \nFirst, friends and family of people who smoke can pass this informa- \ntion to their loved ones, motivating them to quit smoking. Such social \nconcerns, like pressure from the family, has been listed as the second \nmost important motivation to quit after health concerns ( McCaul et al., \n2006 ). In addition, messages about more severe COVID-19 for people \nwho smoke can be used as prevention messages for people who are sus- \nceptible to smoking, and future studies should investigate that. \nThis study also assessed COVID-protective intentions related to the \ncombined risk of smoking and COVID-19. To our knowledge, this rela- \ntionship has not been investigated in the literature. Results showed that \nexposure to the combined risk messages (vs. non-risk control) predicted \ngreater odds of mask-wearing intentions in the next 2 weeks (Table 4) . \nOne interpretation of this ﬁnding is that the additive eﬀect of smoking \nand COVID-19 risk messages were stronger on mask-wearing intentions \nthan COVID-only risk messages. The pattern of results suggests a beneﬁt \nof combining risk information for smoking and COVID-19 to motivate \npeople who smoke to engage in protective behaviors preventing both \nhealth risks. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate \nthat messages about the increased risk of smoking for COVID-19 out- \ncomes impacted both smoking and COVID-protective intentions. These \nﬁndings could have policy implications by showing the utility of messag- \ning on the combined risks of smoking for COVID-19 severity to target \nCOVID-19 outcomes. Research in this area could inform public policy \nin developing countries bearing a high rate of tobacco use and being \nhit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our preliminary results \nshould be replicated with diﬀerent samples in other health communica- \ntion contexts and with diﬀerent message stimuli. Future studies should \nexplore whether these messages can help motivate vaccination inten- \ntions. \nIn addition, we found that individual baseline health perceptions \npredicted lesser odds for certain COVID-19 protective intentions. Specif- \nically, better-perceived health status was associated with lower odds of \nhand-washing intentions. These ﬁndings might be explained by research \non compensatory health beliefs wherein a person believes that healthy \nbehaviors (e.g., good general health) equalizes a negative health behav- \nior (e.g., not washing hands with soap and water; Knäuper et al., 2004 ). \nUnfortunately, this study’s data did not allow for assessing this specula- \ntion, which might be a topic for future research. \nOur study demonstrated that exposure to risk messages resulted in \ngreater negative emotions than the control condition. Past research has \nshown that public health campaigns using strong fear appeals were con- \nsidered more persuasive ( Witte & Allen, 2000 ). Research has shown \nthat fear and disgust aroused from exposure to smoking warning mes- \nsages can motivate intentions to quit smoking ( Hammond, 2011 ). Fear \nof COVID-19 has also been associated with intentions to quit smok- \ning ( Gold et al., 2021 ). Another paper analyzing the data reported \nhere found that exposure to the combined risk messages (vs. smok- \ning risk) resulted in participants feeling more fearful, which fully me- \ndiated the eﬀect of message exposure on intentions to quit smoking \n( Duong et al., 2021 ). Overall, results supported growing scientiﬁc ev- \nidence that negative emotional responses to messages highlighting the \nsevere risk of COVID-19 disease to smokers predict intentions to quit \nsmoking ( Duong et al., 2021 ; Gold et al., 2021 ). As a policy implica- \ntion, these results indicate that governmental agencies (e.g., the Cen- \nters for Disease Control) trying to inﬂuence smoking cessation could \nuse emotion-evoking warning messages about the risk of smoking for \nCOVID-19 severity in-line with best-practices for persuasion in public \nhealth campaigns ( Witte & Allen, 2000 ). \nLimitations \nThis study has several limitations. First, the sample was not repre- \nsentative, thereby limiting our generalizability. Second, outcomes were \nmeasured at one time, and it is unknown how message eﬀects may (or \nmay not) have decayed longitudinally. Third, the context of the pan- \ndemic has changed in several ways since our data collection, including \nsurges of increased infections and deaths in the U.S., a presidential elec- \ntion largely centered on COVID-19, and the approval and administration \nof several COVID-19 vaccines. It is unclear how the current COVID-19 \ncontext, including the latest discovery of the Omicron variant, might in- \nﬂuence combined risk messages about smoking and COVID-19 severity. \nFourth, and ﬁnally, our study focused on behavioral intentions and not \nactual behaviors, although intentions are the most reliable predictors of \nbehaviors ( Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011 ). Still, future research should inves- \ntigate the relationship between health intentions after exposure to com- \nbined risk messages and downstream smoking and COVID-protective be- \nhaviors. \nConclusion \nOur experimental test of smoking and COVID-19 risk messages found \nseveral important results for how people who smoke might respond to \ncombined risk messages. Messages focused on the role of smoking to \nmake COVID-19 worse were most eﬀective at increasing intentions to \nquit smoking in the next 1 month and reduce smoking in the next 6 \nmonths. Exposure to the combined risk messages was associated with \ngreater odds of COVID-protective intentions, such as wearing a mask \nin the next 2-weeks. These eﬀects on smoking and COVID-protective \nintentions were not found in the other message conditions, which sug- \ngested a possible additive eﬀect of combining the risk of smoking with \nincreased severity of COVID-19 in health warning messages. Although \nthis work is preliminary, it serves as a steppingstone to expand tobacco \ncontrol research to the context of infectious diseases that might com- \npound smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Much research is still \nneeded to understand how smokers react to the COVID-19 risk to lever- \nage public health messaging encouraging them to quit smoking for good. \nFunding sources \nResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National \nCancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the Food and \nDrug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (R00CA187460).

The \nvirus main entrance way is through mucosal tissues: nose, mouth, \nupper respiratory tract, and less frequently conjunctival mucosa. \nTobacco smoke exposure results in inflammatory processes in the \nlung, increased mucosal inflammation, expression of inflammatory \ncytokines and tumor necrosis factor α, increased permeability in epi-\nthelial cells, mucus overproduction, and impaired mucociliary clear-\nance.1 Knowledge about host factors, and in particular avoidable \nhost factors such as smoking, may be of importance in reducing viral \ncontamination and the severity of the disease.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in Wuhan, China toward \nthe end of 2019. To the best of our knowledge and at the time of \nthe writing of this Commentary, six published case series reported \nthe prevalence of smoking among individuals with COVID-19 \n(Table 1). The study with the highest number of patients compared \nsevere (N = 173) to nonsevere (N = 926) cases. The percent of cur-\nrent and former smokers were higher among the severe cases: 17% \nand 5%, respectively, than among the nonsevere cases (12% and \n1%, respectively).2 More importantly, among those with the pri-\nmary composite end point (admission to an intensive care unit, the \nuse of mechanical ventilation, or death), the proportion of smokers \nwas higher with than among those without this end point (26% vs. \n12%).2 Another case series also showed more smokers among the \nsevere (N = 58) than among the nonsevere (N = 82) cases.3 The single \nmodifiable host factor associated with progression of COVID-19 \npneumonia was current smoking in a multivariable logistic analysis \n(odds ratio  =  14.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.6–25.0).4 Among \nthose who died the number of smokers was also been found to be \nsomewhat higher (9%, 5/54) than among survivors (6%, 9/137).5\nVardavas and Nikitara’s recent systematic review8 identified \nfive studies2–6 and concluded that “smoking is most likely associ-\nated with negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-\n19.” Conversely, Lippi and Henry’s short meta-analysis reported no \nassociation of smoking status with severity of COVID-19.9 However, \nthe number of cases in most studies to date is very low, and conse-\nquently the 95% confidence intervals very wide.\nThese case series reports are descriptive and do not allow to draw \nfirm conclusions about the association of severity of COVID-19 with \nsmoking status. Underlying health conditions such as COPD, dia-\nbetes, and coronary heart disease are more prevalent among severe \ncases.2,5 Although these can causally be associated with smoking, \nthe specific effect of smoking on COVID-19 severity cannot be \ndisentangled.\nHowever, the nicotine and tobacco research and health care com-\nmunity cannot ignore these signals. We know that tobacco smoke ex-\nposure is a major risk factor for lung disease1 and cigarette smoking \nis a substantial risk factor for bacterial and viral infections.10 In add-\nition, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \nthat caused a small coronavirus epidemic in 2012–215 presented the \nsame clinical features as the current COVID-19, and reports also \nindicated an association between smoking status and fatality rate,11 \nwith current smoking also more frequent among cases than among \ncontrols (37% vs. 19%, odds ratio = 3.14, 95% confidence interval: \n1.10–9.24, N = 146).12\nMERS-CoV infection involves the dipeptidyl peptidase IV \n(DPP4) receptor while SARS-CoV-2 involves the ACE2 receptor \n(angiotensin II conversion enzyme-2 receptor). Both are abundant \nin mucosal epithelial cells and lung alveolar tissue and have multiple \nphysiological functions. To infect the host, both viruses attach to its \nreceptor: MERS-CoV to DPP4 and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, a prob-\nably key step for coronavirus infections.\nDPP4 mRNA and protein expressions are significantly higher \nin smokers compared with never smokers without airflow limita-\ntion and are inversely correlated with lung function.13 It has recently \nbeen reported that ACE2 gene expression is higher in ever smokers \n(both current and former) compared with never smokers in normal \nlung tissue in a sample of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, after \nadjustment for age, gender, and ethnicity. ACE2 gene expression \nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/22/9/1650/5815378 by guest on 01 April 2025\n1651\nNicotine & Tobacco Research, 2020, Vol. 22, No. 9\nwas also higher in small and large airway epithelia of healthy ever \nsmokers compared with never smokers: current smokers had the \nhighest expression, never smokers had the lowest expression; recent \nformer smokers (≤15 years) had higher ACE2 gene expression than \nnonsmokers but not long-term former smokers (>15 years).14\nThe similar upregulation associated with smoking of two dif-\nferent virus receptors observed with two different coronaviruses \nsuggests that smoking contributes to the higher number of viral \nreceptors and may support the findings of the recent case series \nobservations.\nIt is also worth noting that smoking behavior is characterized \nby inhalation and by repetitive hand-to-mouth movements which \nare strongly advised against to reduce viral contamination. Public \nhealth interventions, such as lockdown, may increase the exposure \nof family members to secondhand smoke. Lockdown may be an \nopportune moment to quit to reduce not only the smoker’s health \nrisk but also that of his/her family members. Finally, risk factors of \nCOVID-19 severity (lung and cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, \netc.) are more frequent among smokers. Smoking cessation by any \nmeans should be a priority among smokers with comorbidities.\nFuture Research Directions\nThe nicotine and tobacco research community should explore \nthe role of tobacco in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We need \nstronger evidence about the association of smoking with COVID-19. \nDatabases should be identified and analyses focused on the role of \nthis association in virus contamination, severity of the illness, ability \nto recover, and so on. Smoking status data should be systematically \nrecorded and analyzed among COVID-19 patients. We need data \nabout the immediate and short-term benefit of quitting smoking \namong symptomatic COVID-19 smokers. Laboratory studies should \nfocus on quantifying the viral contamination of tobacco products \nwith particular attention to shared products such as waterpipes. We \nalso need data about alternative nicotine delivery systems and their \nrisk/benefit ratio in relation to COVID-19.\nPublic Health Challenges/Opportunities\nWe suggest that ongoing public health campaigns should include ref-\nerence to the importance of smoking cessation during the pandemic. \nHealth care providers should be involved in offering evidence-\nbased pharmacological and behavioral smoking cessation interven-\ntions by remote support. Quit lines should promote contacts with \nsmokers with or without COVID-19, symptomatic or asymptomatic. \nLockdown may result in social isolation and mental distress both \nincreasing the need for smoking; smoking is more prevalent among \neconomically less-advantaged groups, and they are potentially at \nhigher risk for COVID-19. Large-scale interventions should be tar-\ngeted at these populations in particular.\nSupplementary Material\nA Contributorship Form detailing each author’s specific involvement with this \ncontent, as well as any supplementary data, are available online at https://\nacademic.oup.com/ntr.\nDeclaration of Interests\nNone declared.\nTable 1.  Frequency of Smoking and Former Smoking Among COVID-19 Patients.

A summary of the evidence from the scientific \nliterature \nMaria Sofia Cattaruzza1, Vincenzo Zagà2, Silvano Gallus3, Paolo D’Argenio4, Giuseppe Gorini5\n1Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy; 2Italian Society of Tobaccology \n(SITAB), Italy; 3Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, \nMilan, Italy; 4TobaccoEndgame, Italy; 5Oncologic network, prevention and research Institute (ISPRO), Florence, Italy  \nSummary. Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic burst onto the international scene as a new disease dispropor-\ntionately affecting certain patient groups; hence it has risen many questions yet to be clarified. The aim of this \nstudy was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor asso-\nciated with COVID-19. Methods: articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April \n2020 were identified. Results: data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 \nthan women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was \nhypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher \nprevalence of comorbidities, many of which tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, \nwho were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results, reporting \nan OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe COVID-19 among patients with a smoking his-\ntory. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially \nlower than smoking prevalence in the source populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, \nit is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified \nas nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin-converting- \nenzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 \nin smokers. Conclusions: There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on CO-\nVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.

This is an acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS), which could be character-\nized by distinctive features with near-normal respira-\ntory system compliance despite severe hypoxemia (6). \nConsequently, the existence of two distinct COVID-19 \nphenotypes (Type Low - L and Type High - H) (7) \nhas been hypothesized depending on the interaction of \nseveral factors including severity of the infection, host \nresponse, physiologic reserve, comorbidities. Pneumo-\nnia may be associated with disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation (DIC) which is a strong predictor of mor-\ntality. The pathophysiology of DIC is complex and mul-\ntifactorial involving host and virus issues (8) \nThe COVID-19 does not seem to affect patients \nuniformly, not only from a clinical and prognostic point \nof view, but also from an epidemiological one. From this \nlatter perspective, some patients’ characteristics, includ-\ning gender, age, comorbidities and smoking, raised the \ninterest of the scientific community.\nAim of this paper is to outline main the issues that \nled tobacco smoking to be indicated as a potential risk \nfactor associated with COVID-19, and to summarize \nthe evidence from observational studies, systematic re-\nviews, and meta-analyses published so far, on the rela-\ntionships between smoking history and COVID-19.  \nMaterial and Methods\nPublished articles from MEDLINE and pre-\nprints were identified in order to identify systematic \nreviews, meta-analyses and observational studies on \nthe relationship between tobacco smoking and COV-\nID-19, published from January to April 2020.  \nFor observational studies, we included those with \ncommunity-dwelling or hospitalized adults who had \nbeen tested for SARS-CoV-2 or were diagnosed with \nCOVID-19, providing that data on smoking status \nwere reported. \nResults and Discussion\nIn order to better clarify how the issues about \ntobacco smoking and COVID-19 emerged and pro-\ngressed in the literature, the results are preceded by \nfew considerations on some related epidemiological \naspects, i.e. gender, age, comorbidities.\nGender\nMen and women are infected by SARS-Cov-2 in \nnearly equal numbers, but severe outcomes and mor-\ntality rate seem to be significantly and substantially \nhigher in men than in women, as it was in SARS and \nMERS (2-5, 9-11). \nSome possible explanation for this difference may \nbe sexual dimorphism, higher prevalence of smokers \namong males, higher female personal hygiene.\nSexual dimorphism in innate and adaptive im-\nmunity has been well studied (12). Estrogen has an \nimmune-stimulating effect on the immune system, \nwhile testosterone an immunosuppressive one (13); \nthe X chromosomes contain more immune-related \ngenes: the X chromosome contains 10% of the micro-\nRNA (miRNA) in the human genome compared to \n2% miRNA in the Y chromosome (14, 15). \nAnother reason that has been hypothesized lies \nin the more frequent smoking habit among men than \nwomen (see the section on Smoking). \nAlso, women generally dedicate more time and \nattention to personal hygiene during their daily lives in \ncomparison to men (16).\nAge\nCOVID-19 epidemic seems to mainly affect mid-\ndle-aged and old adults (2-5). \nIn China, the median age of hospitalized COV-\nM. S. Cattaruzza, V. Zagà, S. Gallus, et al.\n108\nID-19 subjects was around 50 years varying accord-\ning to patient samples, being, 47 years in the study by \nGuan (3), 49 years in that by Huang (4) and 57 years \nin that by Zhang (5). \nIn Italy, more than 70% of hospitalized cases had \n50 years or more and the median was 62 years in the \nupdate of 24/April/2020 (17).\nThe reported case-fatality ratio (CFR) for COV-\nID-19 (April 13, 2020) among Chinese and Italian \npatients increases progressively with age, being 8.0% \nand 14.8% among patients aged 70-79 years and 80+ \nyears respectively in China and 9.7% and 21.4% among \nthose aged 70-79 years and 80+ years respectively in \nItaly (2, 18).\nComorbidities\nComorbidities reported in hospitalized patients \naffected by COVID-19 were mainly hypertension, \ncardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), over-\nweight and obesity, asthma, cerebrovascular diseases, \nmalignancy, and chronic kidney disease (2-5, 19). The \nprevalence of comorbidities varies according to patient \nsamples; in the meta-analysis of Emami and coau-\nthors, hypertension (16.4%), cardiovascular diseases \n(CVD) (12.1%), Diabetes (7.9%) and smoking (7.6%) \nwere the most prevalent underlying diseases (19). \nLess than half of hospitalized patients had an un-\nderlying disease. However, the presence of comorbidi-\nties substantially increased the risk of severe prognosis \n(2-5).\nChinese men have higher rates of type 2 diabe-\ntes, hypertension, COPD and lung cancer compared \nto women (3-5).\nMany comorbidities, including COPD, lung can-\ncer and cardiovascular diseases are tobacco-related dis-\neases. \nTobacco smoking\nTobacco smoking is recognized to increase the \nsusceptibility to infections in a multifactorial way, in-\ncluding the alteration of the host’s mechanical (mu-\nco-ciliary) and immunological defenses and the likely \nincreased virulence of virus and bacteria (20). In addi-\ntion, tobacco smoking has a significant impact on the \nimmune system and activates inflammation; moreover, \nthe smoke-related structural and immunological al-\nterations found in chronic bronchitis, COPD and em-\nphysema patients represent ideal attachment areas for \nbacterial and viral infections (21).\nIt was surprising that the first confirmed Italian \ncase of COVID-19, known worldwide, was a 38-year-\nold young healthy male who regularly participated in \nrunning events and soccer games. He experienced an \nextremely short time-lapse between onset of symptoms \nand pneumonia (only 2 days) and was admitted to the \nintensive care unit for respiratory failure, required in-\ntubation and supportive treatment for many weeks and \nfinally recovered (18).\nIntensive fatiguing works, including sport as well \nas smoking, that imply high respiratory volumes, deep \ninhalation, change of breathing from nose to mouth, \nprogressive cooling and drying of the respiratory tract \nmucous, decrease movement of ciliated cells and in-\ncrease mucosal viscosity which impairs filtering of mi-\ncroorganisms from the upper respiratory tract system. \nThese mechanisms are hypothesized to allow the virus \nto spread to lower airways and alveoli, bypassing the \nnatural immune response in the oral cavity and upper \nrespiratory airways and facilitating penetration of virus \nto lower airways at a stage in which an adaptive im-\nmune response is still not initiated (18). \nWhen the first articles about COVID-19 epi-\ndemic in China were published, data became available \nto investigate the role of smoking in COVID-19. \nSince in China smoking habit differs according to \ngender (52.1% of men and only 2.7% of women regu-\nlarly smoke (22)), Chinese men have higher prevalence \nof comorbidities and a higher rate of severe or fatal \noutcomes in COVID-19 pandemic, tobacco smoking \nhas been hypothesized to be an important risk factor \nfor poor prognosis (3, 4).\nIndeed, several studies, as happened in MERS, \nreported that smokers are more likely than non-smok-\ners to have severe symptoms and need for mechanical \nventilation and intensive care unit. Mortality too was \nobserved to be higher among infected smokers com-\npared with infected never smokers (23). \nGuan and colleagues examined 1,099 Chinese \nCOVID-19 patients, showing that 32% of patients \nwith a history of smoking (smokers and ex-smokers) \nat the time of hospitalization had a severe form of \nTobacco smoking and COVID-19 pandemic\n109\nCOVID-19 pneumonia, compared to 15% of never \nsmokers. In addition, 16% of smokers required hospi-\ntalization in intensive care units or died, compared to \n5% of never smokers (3). \nIn another study from China, on patients diag-\nnosed with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, Liu \nand colleagues reported that 27% of smokers worsened \n(including death) within two weeks of hospitalization, \ncompared to 3% of non-smokers (23). A multivariate \nanalysis confirmed the statistically significant associa-\ntion between history of smoking and severe/fatal out-\ncome (23). \nTwo preliminary systematic reviews, investigating \nthe role of smoking on severity of COVID-19, reported \nopposite results: Lippi reported that active smoking was \nnot found to be a significant predictor of COVID-19 \nseverity, despite a trend towards higher risk was appreci-\nable, while Vardavas and Nikitara reported that smok-\ning is most likely associated with negative progression \nand adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Each of these \nsystematic reviews evaluated 5 studies, (some, but not \nall, were included in both analyses), but available data \nwere scanty and the analysis provided failed to show \nestimates adjusted for other potential important con-\nfounding factors, including gender, age and comorbidi-\nties (24, 25).\nA meta-analysis based on 15 studies and recently \npublished in pre-print (i.e., without having received \na peer-review), showed that 63% of COVID-19 pa-\ntients with COPD had a severe form of the disease \ncompared to 33% among patients without COPD; the \nrelative risk (RR) was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.4– 2.4). The au-\nthors also reported that 22% of current smokers and \n46% of ex-smokers had severe complications (26).\nA systematic review and meta-analysis (published \nin pre-print in April, 2020), focusing on smoking and \nCOVID-19 progression, evaluated 12 studies (but not \ntheir quality on smoking data) and reported severe disease \nprogression in 17.8% of smokers in comparison to 9.3% \nof non-smokers and a statistically significant association \nbetween smoking and disease severity (OR = 2.25, 95% \nconfidence interval, CI: 1.49-3.39); nevertheless, out of \n9025 patients only 495 (5.5%) were ever smokers (27). \nIn many studies, reported smoking prevalence among \nhospitalized patients was substantially below smoking \nprevalence in the corresponding populations.\nIn 10 Chinese studies, smoking prevalence in \nhospitalized patients ranged from 3.8% to 14.6% \nwhile in the Chinese population it is 27.7% (52.1% for \nmen and 2.7% for women). Low smoking prevalence \namong hospitalized patients was observed also in Ko-\nrean and in the US patients (27).\nSome researchers recently explained - in articles \npublished in pre-print - these relatively low preva-\nlences of smokers among COVID-19 hospitalized \npatients, in terms of a protective role of nicotine on \nCOVID-19 infection (28-30).\nA very recent systematic review (also published in \npre-print in April 2020), tried to clarify the role of smok-\ning on infection, hospitalization, disease severity and \nmortality from COVID-19 and summarized the main \nfindings emerged so far (31). First, still the majority of \narticles come from China and ethnicity may be a variable \nto be taken into consideration. Indeed, this systematic \nreview included 28 articles: 22 conducted in China, 3 in \nthe United States, 1 in South Korea, 1 in France and 1 \nin multiple countries. Second, the quality of the recorded \ndata on smoking habit is very low: 25 of the 28 studies \ndid not register the smoking habit for many patients and \ndid not explicitly indicate whether the patients who were \nnot included in the group of smokers or ex-smokers were \nconfirmed never smokers. Moreover, in some studies \nsmoking habit was classified as “smokers”, “ex-smokers” \nand “non-smokers plus missing values about smoking”. \nThe latter is a “misleading category” which could have \nbrought authors to erroneously interpret their results. \nAll the 28 studies included in the systematic review \nwere carried out in the context of an emerging epidemic; \ntherefore, the collection of smoking habit was not con-\nsidered a priority. This may have led to an underestima-\ntion of the prevalence of smokers and former smokers \nmay have been conflated with never smokers. Moreover, \nsmokers with severe symptoms of COVID-19 may have \nquit smoking prior to hospitalization and therefore may \nnot have been recorded as current smokers (i.e. reverse \ncausality). WHO definition of “ex-smoker” implies to \nhave quit smoking for at least 6 months (32).\nThis supposed misclassification of smokers as \nnonsmokers is highly likely to have lowered prevalenc-\nes and biased the risk estimates toward the null. \nThe results of this systematic review showed \nthat there was no significant difference between ever \nM. S. Cattaruzza, V. Zagà, S. Gallus, et al.\n110\nand never smokers according to hospital admission \nfor COVID-19 (this result is based on the only two \nstudies where smoking status had been adequately \ncollected) (31). The same systematic review showed, \n(among the 1370 hospitalized people across the two \nhigh-quality studies), that there was greater disease se-\nverity in ever compared with never smokers (RR=1.43, \n95% CI: 1.15-1.77, p = 0.002), while mortality, evalu-\nated only in three studies, could not give any pooled \nestimate due to the high number of missing data (i.e. \n>90% of individuals with no collection of smoking his-\ntory) (31).\nThe hypothesis that nicotine may have a protec-\ntive role in COVID-19 patients, has also contributed \nto the debate on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 \n(ACE2). This enzyme has been identified as the cel-\nlular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (33). ACE-2 is \nexpressed in a variety of different tissues: upper and \nlower respiratory tract (including goblet cells, club/\nClara cells, and alveolar type 2 cells), myocardium, \nkidneys and gastrointestinal mucosa, reflecting the \ntarget organs involved in the disease (the virus was de-\ntected in stool samples from patients with COVID-19 \ngastrointestinal symptoms) (34, 35). \nA study by Smith and colleagues (34) reported \nhigh levels of ACE2 receptors in the respiratory tract \nand in oral epithelial cells of smokers, but not in those \nof never-smokers or ex-smokers. The authors also \nfound that tobacco smoking (expressed as pack-years) \ncauses a dose-dependent upregulation of ACE2, that \nchronic smoking exposure increases ACE2 expression \nand that quitting smoking results in a decrease in lung \nACE2 levels. \nMultivariate linear regression further confirmed \nthat smoking history was a significant predictor of \nACE2 expression even when controlling for a patient’s \nage, sex, race, and body-mass index.\nAccording to the authors, these results may par-\ntially explain why smokers are particularly predisposed \nto a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and why \nquitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibil-\nity (34). \nA dose-dependent regulation of ACE 2 expres-\nsion was also reported by Leung and colleagues in \nCOPD patients undergoing bronchoscopy. In this \nstudy, ACE-2 expression in the bronchial epithelial \ncells (especially in lower respiratory tract) was sig-\nnificantly increased in COPD versus non-COPD \nsubjects. A significant inverse relationship was found \nbetween ACE-2 gene expression and levels of Forced \nExpiratory Volume in the 1st second (FEV1); smok-\ning status was also significantly related to ACE-2 gene \nexpression, with current smokers having a significantly \nhigher gene expression than never smokers, and ex-\nsmokers having level between those of never and cur-\nrent smokers (35). \nBoth these last two studies reported the pres-\nence of a dose-response effect and the study by Smith \nand colleagues also reported that the upregulation of \nACE2 is reversible with quitting smoking; these find-\nings are important elements in the assessment of the \ncausality relationship.\nOther Authors, however, have speculated that \nthere is an inhibiting effect of nicotine on the ACE2 \nreceptor, suggesting a protective effect of nicotine \n(30). This “nicotinic hypothesis” proposes that the \nvirus could enter the body through neurons of the \nolfactory system and/or through the lung, leading to \ndifferent clinical features with different outcome. In \nfact, nicotine, besides increasing the expression and/\nor activity of renin, ACE and Angiotensin II receptor \ntype 1, may in a compensatory way, downregulate the \nexpression and/or activity of ACE2 and Angiotensin \nII receptor type 2. This second possibility has not yet \nbeen explored in the framework of viral neuro-infec-\ntions (30).\nConclusion\nThe role of smoking on COVID-19 is highly con-\ntroversial due to the lack of reliable data. \nCOVID-19 is a new disease that has different \nclinical presentations and affects patients with a wide \nrange of symptoms; our knowledge about it is still in-\ncomplete.\nFurther independent studies, not funded by the \ntobacco industry nor by electronic cigarette compa-\nnies, could contribute to better clarify how smoking \ncontributes to COVID-19. \nLongitudinal studies should be performed to in-\nterview patients, or family members for deceased pa-\nTobacco smoking and COVID-19 pandemic\n111\ntients, in order to collect good quality data about pa-\ntient smoking status. \nAlso, smoking status should be systematically, \nroutinely and accurately collected in clinical records, \nin all countries (37).\nSo far, there is some evidence that smokers and \nex-smokers have anincreased risk of more severe out-\ncomes. \nEven if the role of smoking in COVID-19 has \nto be confirmed, there is evidence that hypertension, \ncardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, COPD, can-\ncer, and chronic kidney disease were among the most \nprevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized \nCOVID-19 patients (19). Since many of these under-\nlying health conditions are tobacco-related diseases, \nsmoking is likely to negatively influence COVID-19 \noutcomes.\nThus, since the pandemic is still under progres-\nsion, tobacco smoking, having highly negative conse-\nquences on health, may represent the most important \navoidable risk factor. We recommend quitting smok-\ning, besides the other well-known health benefits, also \nto protect smokers in case of SARS-Cov-2 infection \n(36, 37). \nConflict of interest: Each author declares that he or she has no \ncommercial associations (e.g. consultancies, stock ownership, equity \ninterest, patent/licensing arrangement etc.) that might pose a con-\nflict of interest in connection with the submitted article\nReferences\n  1. \u0007World Health Organization.

These behaviors may be related to several \nsociodemographic, behavioral and mental health factors. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the association between \nalcohol consumption and cigarette smoking with sociodemographic, behavioral and mental health characteristics. This study \nused data from two population-based studies conducted in two cities from Southern Brazil amid the Covid-19 pandemic. \nIndividuals aged 18 years or older were included and selected using a multistage sampling procedure. Alcohol consumption \nand smoking and changes in such consumption during the Covid-19 pandemic were evaluated. Sociodemographic, behavioral, \npandemic-related, and mental health variables were also included. A hierarchical model was used to conduct the adjusted \nanalyses, and Poisson regression with robust adjustment was used for variance. A total of 2170 individuals were studied. \nThe prevalence of alcohol consumption and smoking were 9.3% and 14.2%, respectively. The rates of increase in alcohol \nconsumption and smoking during the Covid-pandemic were about 20% and 30%, respectively. They were higher among those \nwith depressive symptoms, feeling of sadness and self-reported stress. Those with poor diet quality had higher prevalence \nof alcohol consumption (PR: 1.82) and were 1.58 times more likely to smoke. The findings may help stakeholders in health \nand political systems to better understand the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and develop strategies to mitigate \nthese consequences in Brazil and elsewhere.\nKeywords  COVID-19 · Alcohol drinking · Cigarette smoking · Pandemics\nIntroduction\nAbusive alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking are \ncommon behaviors around the world. In 2017, alcohol per-\ncapita consumption was 6.5 L per year and the prevalence \nof heavy drinking was 20% in the global population [1]. In \nthe region of the Americas, in 2020, 69.8% of males and \n44.3% of females were current drinkers, 38.1% and 9.4% \nof those, respectively, presented heavy drinking episodes \n[2]. Although there was a decline in cigarette smoking in \nthe last years, its prevalence is still high with marked differ-\nences between males and females: 32.7% in men and 6.6% in \nwomen in 2019, accounting for 1.14 billion smokers world-\nwide [3]. Only in Brazil, the prevalence of cigarette smoking \ndecreased from 15.2% (in 2006) to 9.4% in eight years (in \n2014), while the prevalence of abusive alcohol consump-\ntion remained stable, even though there was an important \nincrease of this behavior in women [4].\n *\t Micaela Rabelo Quadra \n\t\nmicaelarquadra@gmail.com\n\t\nAntônio Augusto Schäfer \n\t\nantonioaschafer@unesc.net\n\t\nLeonardo Pozza Santos \n\t\nleonardo_pozza@yahoo.com.br\n\t\nSamuel C.

Traumatic \nevents and crisis have been previous linked to the use of alco-\nhol and tobacco [8, 9], and the Covid-19 pandemic crisis \nmay result in increased alcohol and tobacco consumption. A \nreported increase in the consumption of these substances amid \nthe Covid-19 pandemic had already been found in the popula-\ntion of many countries [10–13]. In Brazil, a study evidenced, \nduring the pandemic, prevalence of smoking of 12%, with 34% \nof the participants reporting to have increased their consump-\ntion of cigarettes per day; and prevalence of increase in alcohol \nconsumption of 17.6% [14].\nStress, depression and anxiety are conditions associated \nwith alcohol consumption and smoking during the SARS-\nCoV-2 outbreak [7, 13, 15, 16], as they act as triggers for con-\nsumption as a way of coping [7, 17, 18]. Furthermore, certain \npopulations can be considered to be more vulnerable to this \npattern: being middle-aged [11], male [19], unmarried [19]; \nhaving higher income [20] or higher level of education [10] \nare also associated with increased alcohol consumption and \ntobacco smoking amid the pandemic.\nIt should be noted that smokers are at a higher risk for \nCovid-19 severity and mortality [21], while alcohol con-\nsumption is biologically related to damage to the respiratory \nsystem and negative outcomes in respiratory infections. How-\never, more studies are needed to explain this relationship with \nCovid-19 [22]. Furthermore, the use of these substances is \nconnected with negative social and protective behaviors, and \nit is an inappropriate coping mechanism for social isolation, \neconomic losses and changes in work and family during this \nmoment [7, 8].\nConsidering the concern related to this scenario and the \nrange of physiological, psychological and behavioral conse-\nquences of the Covid-19 pandemic in the short, medium and \nlong-term, including increase in alcohol consumption and \nsmoking habits, it is crucial to investigate and present evidence \nabout the complex relationship between alcohol, smoking and \nthe pandemic. Therefore, the objective of the present study \nwas to assess the association between alcohol consumption \nand cigarette smoking with sociodemographic, behavioral and \nmental health characteristics in two population-based studies \ncarried out during the Covid-19 pandemic in Southern Brazil.\nMethods\nEthical Aspects, Setting, Study Sample and Data \nCollection\nAll participants who agreed to participate in the study \nprovided informed verbal consent. The Mental Covid \nstudy was approved by the Research Ethics Committee \nof the Federal University of Rio Grande, protocol number \n4.055.737.\nThis cross-sectional study used data from two population-\nbased studies conducted in two cities from Southern Bra-\nzil: Criciúma (Santa Catarina state), and Rio Grande (Rio \nGrande do Sul state). Criciúma has approximately 217,311 \ninhabitants, a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.788, \nand population density of around 815.87 inhabitants per \n­km2. Rio Grande has 211,965 inhabitants, HDI of 0.744, \nand population density of 72.79 inhabitants per ­km2 [23].\nThe study “Mental Covid: impact of Covid-19 on the \nmental health of the population” was conducted amid the \nCovid-19 outbreak between October 2020 and January 2021. \nIndividuals aged 18 years or older who were living in the \nurban area of both cities were eligible to take part in the \nstudy. Subjects who were physically or cognitively unable to \ncomplete the survey were excluded from the sample.\nThe sampling process was conducted in two stages, based \non data from the 2010 Brazilian Demographic Census [24]. \nFirst, primary units (census tracts) were randomly selected. \nSecond, secondary units (households) were randomly chosen \nfrom the previously selected census tracts. The total number \nof households was sampled proportionally to sector size. In \nCriciúma, 60 census tracts out of 307 were sampled, result-\ning in 15,765 households; 607 of them were included in \nthis study. In Rio Grande, 90 census tracts out of 327 were \nsampled, resulting in 29,734 households, 900 of which were \nrandomly selected. All adults aged 18 years old or more liv-\ning in the selected households were invited to participate.\nFace-to-face interviews were conducted by trained per-\nsonnel who worn personal protective equipment during the \nfieldwork in order to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection. A single, \nprecoded, and standardized questionnaire was used in data \ncollection. Data collection was performed using tablets and \nthe RedCap® software was used to store the data; each inter-\nview lasted 30 min on average.\nAlcohol Consumption and Change in the Alcohol \nConsumption During the Covid‑19 Pandemic\nAlcohol consumption was assessed through the following \nquestion: “How many days a week do you usually drink \nany alcoholic beverage?”. The answer options were: “Never \ndrink or less than once a week” and “One day or more than \none day a week”. In the present study, alcohol consumption \nwas dichotomized as “no” (never drink or less than once a \nweek) and “yes” (one day or more than one day a week).\nChanges in alcohol consumption during the Covid-19 \npandemic were assessed by the question: “During the period \nof social distancing, did your alcohol consumption increase, \ndecrease or remain the same?”.\n590\n\t\nJournal of Community Health (2022) 47:588–597\n1 3\nSmoking and Change in Cigarette Consumption \nDuring the Covid‑19 Pandemic\nTo assess cigarette smoking, the following question was \nused: “Do you currently smoke cigarretes?”. The answer \noptions were no; yes, every day; yes, but not every day. In \nthis study, cigarette smoking was dichotomized as “no” and \n“yes” (yes, every day; yes, but not every day).\nTo evaluate changes in cigarette smoking during the \nCovid-19 pandemic, the following question was used: “Dur-\ning the period of social distancing, did your cigarette con-\nsumption increase, decrease or remain the same?”.\nMental Health Variables\nDepressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health \nQuestionnaire (PHQ-9), which is used for screening major \ndepressive episodes (MDE) and validated for the Brazilian \npopulation [25]. The PHQ-9 consists of nine questions con-\nsidering a two-week recall period. Depressive symptoms \nwere defined by the presence of five or more symptoms, \nwith at least one being depressive mood and/or anhedonia. \nSuicidal ideation was assessed using the following question \nof PHQ-9: “In the last two weeks, how many days did you \nthink about hurting yourself in any way or did you think \nthat you would be better off dead?”. Those individuals who \nresponded “never” were classified as not having suicidal \nideation. To assess self-reported feeling of sadness we used \nthe faces scale [26].\nPerceived stress was evaluated through the perceived \nstress scale (PSS), previously validated for the Brazilian \npopulation [27]. It was originally developed as a 14-item \nscale that assessed the perception of stressful experiences \nover the previous month. The total score consisted of the \nsum of points, ranging from 0 to 56 points. The total score \nwas categorized into quintiles, and those individuals in the \nhighest quintile were classified as having the highest level \nof perceived stress.\nSociodemographic, Behavioral \nand Pandemic‑Related Variables\nSociodemographic and behavioral variables were: sex (male, \nfemale), age group (collected in completed years and cat-\negorized as 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60 or older), skin \ncolor (collected as white, black, brown, yellow, indigenous \nand dichotomized into white and others), schooling (elemen-\ntary school, high school, university education), wealth index \n(categorized into tertiles), physical activity (< 150, 150 min \nper week or more), and diet quality (categorized into tertiles) \n[28].\nPandemic-related variables were: got unemployed (no, \nyes), started working at home (no, yes); adherence to social \ndistance (no, yes); infodemic (no, yes); contact with some-\none infected (no, yes); presence of Covid-19 symptoms (no, \nyes); and went to bars or restaurants (no, yes). To evalu-\nate adherence to social distancing, the following question \nwas used: “During the period of social distancing, when \nonly essential services were open, did you leave home?”. \n­Infodemic29 was assessed using the question: “How many \ntimes a day do you search for or receive information about \nCovid-19?”; the answers options were: many times a day, a \nfew times a day, few times a day, only once a day, and a few \ntimes a week. We considered as infodemic those individuals \nwho answered “many times a day”.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll analyses were performed in STATA version 12.1\nProportions and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were \nused to describe the characteristics of the sample as well \nas changes in alcohol and cigarette consumption during the \nCovid-19 pandemic. Crude analysis of association of alcohol \nconsumption and cigarette smoking according to sociode-\nmographic, behavioral, pandemic-related, and mental health \nvariables were assessed using Fisher’s exact test with sig-\nnificance level of 5%.\nTo evaluate whether the significant associations that \nhad been found were independent of possible confound-\ning variables, adjusted Poisson regression was used with \nrobust adjustment for variance, presenting the p-value corre-\nsponding to the Wald test for heterogeneity or linear ­trend30. \nRegression results were reported as prevalence ratio (PR) \nand its corresponding 95% CI\nTo identify the possible confounders, we used a level \nhierarchical model of analysis [29]. Variables were selected \nusing backward method considering each hierarchical level, \nand those variables with p-value < 0.20 remained in the final \nmodel.\nThree different models of adjusted analysis were used. \nFor the association of alcohol consumption and cigarette \nsmoking according to the sociodemographic and behavioral \ncharacteristics, the possible confounding variables included \nwere: sex, age, skin color, schooling, wealth index, physi-\ncal activity, and diet quality. To analyze the association \nof alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking according \nto the pandemic-related variables, in addition to the soci-\nodemographic and behavioral variables mentioned above, \nthe following information was included: got unemployed, \nstarted working at home, adherence to social distance, info-\ndemic, contact with someone infected, presence of Covid-19 \nsymptoms, and went to bars or restaurants. To analyze the \nassociation of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking \naccording to mental health variables, the sociodemographic, \nbehavioral, and pandemic-related variables mentioned above \nwere included as possible confounders.\n591\nJournal of Community Health (2022) 47:588–597\t\n1 3\nSensitivity analyses were also performed for evaluat-\ning the association of changes in alcohol consumption and \ncigarette smoking (decreased, increased, remained similar) \nduring Covid-19 pandemic according to sociodemographic, \nbehavioral, pandemic-related, and mental health variables. \nFor these analyses were included only the individuals who \nreported to consume alcohol and cigarette. Fisher’s exact test \nwas used for these analyses.\nResults\nA total of 2,170 individuals were included in our analyses \n(75% of response rate). Most of them were female (59.7%) \nand self-reported white skin color (83.9%), and one third \nof them were elderly (31.2%). One-fourth of participants \nhad university education (25.6%) and were physically active \n(24.7%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms and sui-\ncidal ideation were 13% and 3.8%, respectively. Moreover, \nabout 18% of the individuals reported being stressed in the \nlast month (data not shown).\nThe prevalence of alcohol consumption was 9.3% \n(95% CI: 8.2; 10.6), with no differences among skin color, \nschooling, and wealth index variables. After adjustment \nfor the possible confounders, men, younger, physically \nactive individuals, as well as those with worse diet qual-\nity, were more likely to consume alcohol. Males were 295% \n(PR = 3.95; 95% CI: 3.03; 5.16) more likely to consume \nalcohol than females. The prevalence of alcohol consump-\ntion decreased with increasing age, while it increased with \nincreasing schooling. The physically active individuals pre-\nsented higher prevalence of alcohol consumption (PR = 1.72; \n95% CI: 1.32; 2.25). In addition, the individuals with poor \ndiet quality were 1.82 times (95% CI: 1.29; 2.57) more likely \nto consume alcohol (Table 1).\nThe prevalence of cigarette smoking was 14.2% (95% CI: \n12.8; 15.8), with no differences among sex, age group, skin \ncolor and physical activity. Schooling, wealth index, and \ndiet quality remained associated with cigarette smoking after \nadjustment for potential confounders. The less educated indi-\nviduals were almost 2 times more likely to smoke cigarettes \nthan the more educated ones (p < 0.001). Moreover, people \nwith poor diet quality were 58% (PR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.22; \n2.04) more likely to smoke cigarettes when compared to the \nindividuals with better diet quality (Table 1).\nTable 2 shows the association between alcohol consump-\ntion and cigarette smoking with pandemic-related variables. \nHaving had contact with someone infected and having been \nto bars or restaurants increased the probability of consuming \nalcohol by 65% (95% CI: 1.21; 2.25) and 87% (95% CI: 1.32; \n2.64), respectively. The prevalence of cigarette smoking was \n100% higher among those individuals who got unemployed \n(PR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.51; 2.68) after adjustment for potential \nconfounders.\nThe analyses of association between alcohol consumption \nand cigarette smoking with mental health disorders showed \nthat these disorders were not related to alcohol consump-\ntion. However, depression was associated with smoking: \nindividuals with depressive symptoms were 45% (PR = 1.45, \n95% CI: 1.08; 1.94) more likely to smoke when compared to \nthose who were not depressed (Table 3).\nFigure 1 shows changes in alcohol consumption and \ncigarette smoking during the Covid-19 pandemic. Around \n18% (95% CI: 13.7; 23.5) of individuals reported hav-\ning increased alcohol consumption while 19.8% (95% CI: \n15.2; 25.3) of them reported having decreased consump-\ntion. Increasing in cigarette smoking was reported by 29.7% \n(95% CI: 24.4; 35.5) of the participants and 17.5% of them \n(95% CI: 13.3; 22.6) reported having decreased their con-\nsumption. Sensitivity analysis showed that the individuals \nwho reported having increased their alcohol consump-\ntion during the Covid-19 pandemic were younger, more \neducated and with non-white skin colour. In addition, the \nincrease in alcohol consumption was also higher in smokers, \nhad depressive symptoms or felt sadness (Supplementary \nTables 1 and 3). Increasing in cigarette smoking was higher \namong younger individuals, in those with higher level of \nstress, depressive symptoms and feelings of sadness (Sup-\nplementary Tables 4 and 6).\nDiscussion\nThe present study—which aimed to assess sociodemo-\ngraphic, behavioral and mental health characteristics asso-\nciated with alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking in \ntwo population-based studies from Brazil—brings interest-\ning results from the understanding of the consequences of \nthe pandemic for public health. Although mental health \ndisorders have not been associated with current alcohol \nconsumption and cigarette smoking, higher prevalence of \ndepressive symptoms, felling of sadness and self-perceived \nstress were associated with increases in these behaviors amid \nthe Covid-19 pandemic.\nA recently published meta-analysis has shown that the \nCovid-19 pandemic increased mental health disorders \nworldwide, especially in healthcare workers [30]. In addi-\ntion, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking appear to \nbe associated with these disorders [7, 13, 15, 16], as such \nbehaviors are often seen as ways to relieve stress, depres-\nsion and sadness [7, 31], and these conditions are commonly \nlinked to the Covid-19 outbreak. The increase in mental \nhealth disorders and the use of alcohol and cigarette as ways \nof coping with these problems may help to understand why \n592\n\t\nJournal of Community Health (2022) 47:588–597\n1 3\ndepressive symptoms, felling of sadness and self-perceived \nstress were linked to increases in alcohol consumption and \ncigarette smoking in the present study.\nOther observational investigations have also found similar \nresults to the ones presented here. An online survey with \nmore than 45 thousand Brazilian adults, performed amid the \nCovid-19 pandemic, showed that people who often or always \nfelt sad or depressed presented a higher increase in ciga-\nrette smoking (PR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.4;3.7; PR = 2.4; 95% CI: \n1.4;4.0, respectively) [32]. Another online cross-sectional \nsurvey conducted in the United Kingdom with more than \n30 thousand adults found that drinking more alcohol than \nusual during the pandemic was related to stress and anxiety \ndisorders [15].\nAlong with the association between mental health \ncharacteristics and increase in alcohol and cigarette con-\nsumption, another finding was that becoming unemployed \nduring the pandemic was linked to higher prevalence of \ncurrent cigarette smoking. It is an important result because \nBrazil has suffered with high rates of unemployment over \nthe last few years, owing to its economic and political \ncrisis, with younger individuals being the most affected \nones [33]. As a result of several actions, e.g., warnings \non cigarette packages and ban on cigarette advertisements \nin the media, Brazil has succeeded in combatting tobacco \nTable 1   Crude and adjusted analyses of association between alcohol consumption and smoking during the Covid-19 pandemic with sociode-\nmograpic and behavioral characteristics of the individuals.

From 2006 to 2014, there \nwas a drop of more than five percentage points in the prev-\nalence of tobacco use [4]. However, the combination of \nhigh prevalence of unemployment and the consequences \nof the Covid-19 pandemic on people’s health can mitigate \nthe decrease in the prevalence of cigarette smoking found \nin Brazil, particularly in younger populations.\nAdditionally, it was also found that younger individuals \n(18 to 29 years old) presented a higher prevalence of alco-\nhol consumption when compared to the older ones. His-\ntorically, economic crisis and respiratory outbreaks have \nbeen linked with increases in alcohol consumption [8], \nand research previous to the Covid-19 pandemic demon-\nstrated that both alcohol and cigarette use were associated \nwith losing one’s job [34]. High rates of unemployment \nand higher prevalence of alcohol consumption in younger \nadults can illustrate a post-pandemic scenario where find-\ning a job can be even harder for those individuals who \nhave already been the most affected by the labor market \ncrisis in Brazil.\nThis whole range of consequences related to the Covid-19 \npandemic can impact national public health policies, includ-\ning the National Health Promotion Policy, which addresses \nseveral themes, including the fight against the use of ciga-\nrettes and excessive alcohol consumption, through social, \nlegislative, environmental and economic actions [35]. These \nmeasures have been effective [36], but operationalization \nmay be impaired by Covid-19 pandemic and the social and \nbehavioral factors associated, as above mentioned.\nOur study also showed that diet quality was linked with \nboth tobacco and alcohol consumption. Those individuals \nwith poor diet quality presented a higher prevalence of \ncigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. The social \nrestrictions of the coronavirus outbreak have triggered \nTable 2   Crude and adjusted analyses of association between alcohol consumption and smoking with pandemic-related variables.

If \nthe lack of a high-quality diet might favor alcohol con-\nsumption and cigarette smoking, the opposite is also true. \nCigarette smoking and alcohol consumption can be conse-\nquences of worry and stress about a food insecurity status. \nOn the other hand, both behaviors can lead to inadequate \ndietary intake and difficulty in food acquisition as a result \nof a restricted financial source for it [41, 42].\nIt should also be noted that some socioeconomic and \ndemographic characteristics were linked to alcohol con-\nsumption and cigarette smoking in the present study. Being \nmale, younger and physically active were associated with a \nhigher prevalence of alcohol consumption, while a higher \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was related to a lower \nwealth index and lower schooling. Other studies conducted \namid the Covid-19 pandemic associated sociodemographic \nand behavioral characteristics with changes in alcohol \nconsumption and cigarette smoking. In the United States, \nadults between 18 and 44 years old presented a higher \nprevalence of increase in alcohol consumption, and those \nwith a higher income had a lower prevalence of cigarette \nsmoking compared to less wealthy individuals [43]. In \nFrance, being between 18 and 34 years old was associated \nwith increased alcohol and cigarette consumption [10], \nwhile in Brazil, individuals with lower educational levels \nTable 3   Crude and adjusted analyses of association between alcohol consumption and smoking with mental health disorders.

In addition, the \nimpacts of the pandemic on behaviours and health vary \naround the world and according to the strategies adopted by \ndifferent countries to mitigate or eliminate the virus [5, 44, \n45]. In Brazil, the pandemic started in a context of political \nand economic crisis, which led the less favoured socioeco-\nnomic strata and the youngest individuals to be the most \naffected by the Covid-19 outbreak [33, 46].\nAlso noteworthy is the overall prevalence of depressive \nsymptoms found in the present study, which was higher \nwhen compared to data for Brazil as a whole. According to \ndata from the 2019 National Health Survey, the prevalence \nof depression in Brazilian adults was 10.2% (vs. 13.0% in \nthe present study) [47]. A cohort study conducted during \nthe Covid-19 pandemic in the Brazilian Southern region, \nthe same region where Criciúma is located, evidenced a \nsharp increase in the prevalence of depressive symptoms. \nSevere depression symptoms before Covid-19 were reported \nby 3.9% of the population and increased to 29.1% amid the \npandemic [48]. Historically, the South region presents one \nof the highest prevalence of depressive disorders in Brazil \n[49, 50], and the impacts of Covid-19 pandemic can further \nincrease the population’s mental health problems [44, 45].\nThis study has some methodological limitations. The \ncross-sectional design does not allow establishing causal-\nity in the associations; therefore, results must be interpreted \nwith caution. Moreover, alcohol consumption and cigarette \nsmoking, as well as the changes in these behaviours amid the \nCovid-19 pandemic, were self-reported, which may underes-\ntimate the prevalence found here. In addition, heavy drink-\ning, an important aspect to health and behaviour outcomes, \nwas not evaluated. The assessment of depressive symptoms, \nsuicidal ideation, feeling of sadness and perceived stress was \nperformed by screening tools that cannot be used as diagnos-\ntic. However, the PHQ-9, the PSS and faces scale are easy \nand quick to apply, and widely used in population-based \nstudies [25–27, 50]. As strengths, this is a population-based \nstudy; for this reason, it is important to describe and evalu-\nate health conditions and the epidemiological situation of \nthe population. Furthermore, the interviews were conducted \nface-to-face, at participants’ households, a distinction when \ncompared to other surveys conducted amid the Covid-19 \npandemic, which have mostly collected data using online \nplatforms.\nIn conclusion, during the Covid-19 pandemic, around \n20% and 30% of the individuals have reported increase in \nalcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, respectively, \nin both cities in Brazil. Consumption was higher among \nthose with depressive symptoms, feeling of sadness and \nself-reported stress. In addition, both alcohol consumption \nand cigarette smoking were more prevalent in individuals \nwith poor diet quality. These results may help stakehold-\ners in health and political systems to better understand the \nconsequences of Covid-19 pandemic and build strategies to \nmitigate these consequences in Brazil and elsewhere.\nSupplementary Information  The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https://​doi.​org/​10.​1007/​s10900-​022-​01085-5.\nAuthor Contributions  AAS, FOM and SCD contributed to the study \nconception and design.

The world is struggling and work-\ning to contain the disease and death of this active new virus. \nOn top of the medical toll, the COVID-19 pandemic has \nresulted in severe economic devastation that has tragic and \nwidespread consequences for human health and suffering.\nMultiple strategies are necessary to end this pandemic. \nSome of these actions are supplying all health professionals \nwith personal protective equipment, reorganizing health-\ncare systems with COVID-19 dedicated high-dependency \nhospitals/wards, testing new treatments and vaccines, and \nmotivating people to maintain social distancing practices \neven when the pandemic recedes.\nIn the absence of long-term immunization against SARS-\nCoV-2 or effective therapies for COVID-19, healthcare pro-\nfessionals must have access to clear information that accu-\nrately predicts which patients with the virus would go on \nto develop clinical deterioration of COVID-19 (high-risk \npopulations). A better clinical definition of those at high-\nrisk for severe illness with COVID-19 is vital for effective \nclinical assessment, risk stratification, resource allocation \nrepositioning, and targeted public health interventions.\nSome conclusive predictors of the risks for severe illness \nhave been clearly described: the presence of co-morbidities \n[1], older age [2], breathlessness [3] and lymphopenia [4]. \nMany other predictors of COVID-19 that result in clinical \nseverity have been proposed, but their validity has been \nquestioned. The difficulty in identifying predictors is not \nsurprising considering that anamnestic and behavioral data \nmight have been collected inaccurately due to the extremely \nchallenging situations at wards/ICUs with work overloads \nand operating in a persistent state of emergency.\nIntuitively, one vulnerability to severe illness from \nCOVID-19 would be assumed to be cigarette smoking [8] \nbecause it is known to increase the risk of serious respira-\ntory infections [5–7]. But is this in fact true? In this issue \nof Internal and Emergency Medicine, Farsalinos et al. [9] \nexplore the hypothesis that smokers are at higher risk and \nunexpectedly found data that point to the opposite and \ncounter-intuitive conclusion that smoking may actually \nhave a protective effect. Their systematic review observed \nthat smoking is vastly protective for hospitalized COVID-\n19 based on the surprisingly low prevalence of smoking in \npatients hospitalized with COVID-19. While it is possible \nthat the prevalence of smokers in Chinese case series may be \nunderrepresented due to inaccurate recording of their smok-\ning status, similar findings have been now being reported in \nthe US, Germany and in France. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC) [10] report an unusually low \nprevalence of current smoking among COVID-19 cases at \n1.3% compared to population smoking prevalence in US of \n16.5% [11]. A cross-sectional analysis of 4103 laboratory-\nconfirmed COVID-19 patients treated at academic hospitals \nin New York City, demonstrated again a low smoking preva-\nlence of 5.2% [12]. A multivariate analysis performed by the \nNew York researchers showed a significant protective effect \nagainst hospitalization among current and former tobacco \nusers (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.57–0.87 p = 0.001). Moreover, \nsmoking was not a risk factor for critical disease or death. \nIn Germany, a recent case series of hospitalized COVID-19 \npatients found a low smoking prevalence of about 6% [13]. \nThe protective association has been also recently observed \nin France where smoking prevalence reported for various \nage groups and levels of disease severity roughly average to \nabout 1/5 of the population prevalence [14]. These findings \n *\t Riccardo Polosa \n\t\npolosa@unict.it\n1\t\nDipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale \n(MEDCLIN), University of Catania, Catania, Italy\n2\t\nCenter of Excellence for the Acceleration of HArm \nReduction (CoEHAR), University of Catania, Catania, Italy\n3\t\nInternal Medicine, Luzerner Kantonsspital, LUKS, Luzern, \nSwitzerland\n854\n\t\nInternal and Emergency Medicine (2020) 15:853–856\n1 3\nare consistent with the Chinese findings of Farsalinos et al. \n[9].\nGiven the circumstances of the pandemic, the quality of \nChinese, US and German data is uncertain. The counter-\nintuitive implications of these findings make it difficult to \naccept that somehow smoking could be a protective factor. \nYet those who warn of increased risks for COVID-19 inci-\ndence and severity from smoking should not present this \nadvice as anything but a supposition based on the known \nlink between smoking and COVID-19 datasets.\nFor the evidence about the effects of smoking on COVID-\n19, the accuracy of Chinese reporting could be questioned. \nGuan et al. [1] recently reported frequency of comorbidi-\nties in 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 \npatients and added an additional 489 COVID-19 Chinese \npatients to the original sample of 1099 patients, altering the \ndataset that the authors had published a few weeks earlier \n[15]. A careful examination of both papers points to sub-\nstantial discrepancies. The most inexplicable relates to the \nnumber of patients with chronic renal disease, with a phe-\nnomenal 34-fold increase of cases from 8 (0.7% of the total \nsample of 1099) to 269 (16.9% of the total sample of 1590). \nThe same discrepancy occurs with the number of COVID-\n19 patients with cancer increasing 13-fold from 0.9 to 8.2% \nand patients with immunodeficiency increasing 30-fold from \n0.2 to 3.7%. Another puzzling discrepancy is that the larger \nstudy has fewer current/former smokers (n = 111) compared \nto numbers reported in the smaller study (n = 158). In a ret-\nrospective case–control Chinese study comparing hospital-\nized COVID-19 patients with ARDS to hospitalized H1N1 \npatients with ARDS, 11% of the 73 patients with ARDS due \nto SARS-CoV-2 were smokers and 47% of the 75 patients \nwith ARDS due to H1N1 were smokers [16]. This substan-\ntial difference in the number of patients who smoke suggests \nthat Chinese clinicians do not appear to be under-reporting \npatients’ smoking status in their medical records. Moreover, \none Chinese paper that actively gathered detailed smoking \ndata rather than relying on medical records reported that \nonly 2 of 140 COVID-19 patients smoked and that seven \nwere former smokers [17]. Thus, similar low smoking preva-\nlence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was also found \neven when using better data collection methods for reporting \nsmoking status. Of note, the Chinese paper which accurately \nreports smoking status observed the lowest smoking preva-\nlence of all those included in the analysis by Farsalinos et al. \n([9]; see Fig. 1).\nAssuming limited confidence in the accuracy of the \nreporting of the studies from China, the US, and Germany, \nwhat are the implications of the findings? Given the magni-\ntude of the protective effect, should people consider smok-\ning until the pandemic subsides? Of course, such a highly \nprovocative proposition is medically indefensible. Yet in the \nquest for new therapies to stem the spread of the Coronavirus \npandemic and limit morbidity and mortality from COVID-\n19 these findings deserve serious scientific consideration.\nThe frantic search for new therapies and vaccines to stem \nthe spread of the Coronavirus pandemic and limit morbidity \nand mortality from COVID-19 drives the ultimate 21st cen-\ntury gold rush, to which new protagonists are continuously \nadded on a weekly basis. As of the 23rd of April 2020, Clini-\ncalTrials.gov listed a massive 801 ongoing clinical studies \non COVID-19, including randomized trials investigating \nantivirals, biologics, immunomodulatory drugs, monoclo-\nnal antibodies, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, antico-\nagulants, and many others (https​://clini​caltr​ials.gov/ct2/resul​\nts?cond=COVID​&term=&cntry​=&state​=&city=&dist =).\nThe analysis by Farsalinos et al. [9] may have therapeu-\ntic implications. Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of \nthousands of harmful and potentially harmful constituents. \nAlthough the health risks of cigarette smoking are well \ndocumented, experimental evidence indicates that ciga-\nrette smoking may exert both adverse and beneficial effects \nof cigarette smoke to modulate the immune system [18]. \nAmongst the many constituents of cigarette smoke, carbon \nmonoxide [19], several flavorings (e.g., menthol) [20], and \nnicotine [21] have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory \nand positive immune-modulatory function.\nBased on the research that shows nicotine can prevent \nacute lung injury which is similar to COVID-19 pneumonia, \nand that nicotine inhibits the production of pro-inflamma-\ntory cytokines, the review authors hypothesize that nico-\ntine might reduce the risk for severe COVID-19. In light of \nthese findings, they propose that pharmaceutical nicotine \nmay be used as a potential treatment option in COVID-19. \nThere is concern about this potential therapy because the \nimpact of long term use of nicotine replacement therapy \non the immune system is not known. Yet nicotine is rela-\ntively safe for human consumption at low concentrations as \nnicotine replacement therapy as well as nicotine-containing \nvaping and heated tobacco products and has been used for \nrelatively short periods of time in non-smokers [22–24]. In \naddition, the World Health Organization (WHO) lists nico-\ntine replacement as an essential medicine. Therefore, health \nand regulatory authorities have sufficient evidence of clinical \nsafety these medicines to fast-track clinical trials of nicotine \npatches.\nFurther evidence of the effect of nicotine on COVID-19 \nshould be observed in Sweden where snus—an oral tobacco \nproduct that releases high concentrations of nicotine—con-\nsumption is highly prevalent. If the hypothesis of nicotine \nbeing protective against hospitalized COVID-19 is correct, \nthis should be evident by analyzing the prevalence of snus \nusage in Swedish patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In \nthe same way, the impact of other popular nicotine delivery \nproducts such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products \non the severity of COVID-19 hospitalizations should be \n855\nInternal and Emergency Medicine (2020) 15:853–856\t\n1 3\nincluded in COVID-19 surveillance particularly in coun-\ntries such as the UK where nicotine vaping is highly preva-\nlent. The consistent observation that smoking prevalence is \nsurprisingly low among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, \nshould not be dismissed out of hand but monitored. The use \nof nicotine patches as a treatment for COVID-19 appears \nto have some potential in the race to find solutions for this \nterrible pandemic.\nGiven the importance of the active role that internists, \ngeneral physicians and hospital staff play in assisting patients \nwith COVID-19 and for patients with smoking-related dis-\neases, Internal and Emergency Medicine remains commit-\nted to further advancing the scientific debate on COVID-19, \nincluding addressing the impact of smoking and vaping on \nCOVID-19 disease.\nCompliance with ethical standards \nConflict of interest  RP is full-time employee at the University of Cata-\nnia, Italy.

In the wake of some major previous social (1)\nand economic disruptions (2), cigarette smoking increased. The\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic may have affected\nsmoking behavior in myriad ways. Financial strain from job loss (3, 4)\nand pandemic-related anxiety might have increased unhealthy coping\nbehaviors, including tobacco use. But ﬁnancial strain was cushioned\nby trillions of dollars of federal government pandemic-relief\nspending, and worries about a dangerous respiratory virus might\nhave deterred cigarette use.\nWe examined changes in smoking prevalence in the United\nStates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the 2016–2020 Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System (BRFSS) (N= 2,193,981), a nationally\nrepresentative telephone survey of U.S. adults conducted by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention with U.S. states/\nterritories.\nWe tabulated the prevalence of current smoking, deﬁned as\nhaving smoked 100 or more lifetime cigarettes and to be\ncurrently smoking, each survey year and interview quarter. We\nconsidered quarter 1 (Q1)-2016 to Q4-2019 the prepandemic\nperiod and Q2-2020 to Q4-2020 the pandemic period. We\nexcluded 95,396 subjects with missing data on smoking, and (for\nquarterly estimates) 11,288 subjects whose 2020 BRFSS interview\noccurred in early 2021.\nWe ﬁrst examined trends according to interview quarter, both\nfor the overall population and for age, sex, racial/ethnicity, income,\nand (for 2018–2020 only) urban/rural county subgroups.\nTo assess changes associated with the pandemic’s onset, we\nperformed an interrupted time series analysis using multivariable\nlinear probability regression with the pre/post pandemic\nindicator as the predictor of interest, and with interview quarter\ntreated as a continuous variable. To account for demographic\nshifts, we also included covariates for age, region, sex, education,\nrace/ethnicity, and marital status. To evaluate whether changes\nin prevalence differed among aforementioned subgroups, we\nperformed regressions that additionally included interaction\nterms for subgroup indicator 3 pre/post indicator and subgroup\nindicator 3 interview quarter.\nFor multivariable regressions, we excluded an additional 105,646\nindividuals interviewed Q1-2020, the quarter during which the\npandemic unfolded, and then 82,559 individuals with missing data\nfor one or morecovariates.\nAnalyses were conducted with Stata 16 using BRFSS sampling\nweights and appropriate procedures for complex survey data. The\ninstitutional review board at the authors' institutions do not consider\nstudy of deidentiﬁed, publicly available data to be Human Subjects\nResearch.\nResults\nOur study population consisted of 2,087,297 adults. Mean age was\n47.5 years prepandemic and 47.6 years postpandemic; 51% of\nrespondents were female in both periods.\nBetween survey years 2016 and 2019, annual smoking prevalence\nfell from 16.3% to 15.3%, and then more abruptly to 14.2% in 2020\n(data not shown). Figure 1 provides quarterly trends in smoking\nprevalence overall and by subgroup.

Quarters refer to time when interview was conducted and do not necessarily correspond with survey\nyear, as a small number of individuals in each BRFSS survey year are not interviewed until early in the following calendar year; here, they are presented at\nthe time of interview, although the annual estimates reported in the main text refer to survey year. Study population: (A) Overall: N=2,087,297; (B) Age:\nN=2,087,297; (C) Sex: N=2,086,076; (D) Income: N=1,747,808; (E) Race: N=2,048,779; and (F) Urban/rural: N=1,169,146. The BRFSS imputed age\nfor those with missing data for all years. The BRFSS also imputed race/ethnicity for those with missing data for 2017–2020 based on most common race/\nethnicity in the region.

In all years, smoking\nrates were higher among men than women and among lower-income\nversus higher-income individuals. Smoking prevalence was highest\namong American Indians/Alaskan Natives and lowest among Asians,\nwith a substantial decrease among Hispanics after Q1-2020. After\npandemic onset, smoking prevalence appeared to decrease in urban\ncounties (which began the period with lower smoking rates) but\nchanged little in rural counties.\nTable 1 provides results adjusted for demographic factors\nand linear smoking trends, both for the overall population and\namong subgroups. Smoking prevalence in the overall population\nfell by an adjusted 0.59 percentage points (95% conﬁdence\ninterval [CI], 20.99 to 20.19) after pandemic onset. After\npandemic onset, individuals ages 18–34 years experienced an\nadjusted 1.66 percentage point reduction (95% CI, 22.62 to\n20.70) in smoking prevalence relative to individuals ages\n55 years or older. Relative to non-Hispanic White individuals,\nHispanic individuals had a 1.45 percentage point decrease\n(22.79 to 20.12) in smoking prevalence after onset of the\npandemic. Differential changes between other subgroups did not\nreach statistical signiﬁcance.\nDiscussion\nSmoking prevalence fell during the COVID-19 pandemic in the\nUnited States, particularly among younger and Hispanic individuals,\na trend that runs counter to those observed in some past social\nupheavals.\nThe causes of this salutary behavioral change are uncertain. In\nthe past, increasing unemployment has sometimes been associated\nwith increases in unhealthy coping behaviors, including cigarette\nsmoking (3, 4) (e.g., a 600,000-person increase in the number of\nsmokers in the United States [2] [although not in Iceland (5)]\nduring the Great Recession). Dislocation, social isolation, and\nanxiety (6) might also be expected to increase psychosocial strain\nTable 1.

Moreover, speciﬁc worries\nabout lung health occasioned by the epidemic of severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory illness\nmay have deterred smoking uptake. School closures could also have\nreduced smoking behaviors among parents seeking to avoid smoking\naround children; in addition, for some, work- or commuting-related\nstress was potentially alleviated.\nA few studies have examined the impact of COVID-19\non smoking. For instance, a survey conducted in Italy found\nthat smoking prevalence decreased, although cigarette\nconsumption increased among those who continued to smoke\n(8). However, previous analyses have had major limitations,\nincluding a lack of prepandemic sampling or limited\ngeneralizability (9, 10).\nAlthough our study avoids these limitations, selection bias\ncaused by the disruption of data collection because of the\npandemic could raise concern about the comparability of the\nsamples. However, the BRFSS was conducted by telephone both\nbefore and during the pandemic, and the 2020 response rate\n(47.9%) was, reassuringly, similar to that of the 2019 survey\n(49.4%). Unfortunately, we had no information on the quantity of\ncigarettes consumed by smokers.\nOur ﬁndings suggest that increases in tobacco uptake may be\navoidable during a period of pandemic-induced economic and\nsocial disruption. Public health agencies and clinicians should seek\nto consolidate these gains, and policymakers should assist such\nefforts by assuring adequate ﬁnancial supports for disadvantaged\nAmericans. \u0001\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this letter at\nwww.atsjournals.org.\nAdam Gaffney, M.D., M.P.H.*\nCambridge Health Alliance\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nand\nHarvard Medical School\nBoston, Massachusetts\nDavid U.

The latest international guidelines for \ndiagnosis and management of the disease were \npublished in 1999 [1]. An update of the official \nposition of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) \nexpert regarding the Clinical Practice Guideline \nfor the Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis was released in \nApril, this year [2].\nThe document does not present a signifi-\ncantly changed approach to the diagnosis of \nthe disease but presents an expert position on \ncertain clinical situations that the practitioner \nmeets when determining the diagnosis of sarcoid-\nosis. The guidelines were developed according \nto the GRADE methodology (Grading of Rec-\nommendations Assessment, Development, and \nEvaluation), based on a systematic review of the \nliterature and, where appropriate, meta-analysis, \nin order to summarize the best available evidence. \nDiagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized, \nbut there is a general consensus that it should \nbe based on the following criteria: consistent, \nadequate clinical presentation, demonstration of \nthe presence of granulomatous lesions in patho-\nmorphological examination (in one or more tissue \nsamples) and the exclusion of alternative causes \nof granulomatous disease [2].\nIn this article, the reader will find, briefly \npresented, the most important position of ATS \nexperts regarding selected aspects of the diagnosis \nof sarcoidosis, with a comment from the authors \nof this editorial.\nSummary of the ATS 2020 recommendations\nPathomorphological examination \nof lymph nodes\nIn patients who are highly likely to have \na clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis (e.g. Lofgren’s \nsyndrome, symptoms of “lupus pernio” or Heer-\nfordt’s syndrome), a panel of experts allows (sug-\ngests) NOT sampling lymph nodes (conditional \nrecommendation, very low quality evidence). In \nasymptomatic patients with changes in the ra-\ndiological image indicating bilateral symmetrical \npulmonary lymphadenopathy, recommendations \nfor or against a lymph node biopsy were not made, \ndue to insufficient evidence, either for or against \na routine lymph node biopsy. The need for further \nclose clinical observation is emphasized in all \npatients whose biopsy was postponed. \nIn patients with suspected sarcoidosis, with \nhilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy, in whom \nlymph node sampling is planned, endobronchial \nultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy instead of me-\ndiastinoscopy is suggested as the first diagnostic \ntool (conditional recommendation, evidence of \nvery low quality).\nScreening for extrapulmonary sarcoidosis\nIn all patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis, \nscreening for extrapulmonary lesions is suggested. \nInitial ophthalmological examination in all pa-\ntients (regardless of the presence of ocular symp-\ntoms) is suggested as screening for ocular sarcoid-\nosis (conditional recommendation, evidence of \nvery low quality). \nIn the panel of initial laboratory tests, it is \nsuggested that   the concentration of serum creat-\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 293–296\n294\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\ninine for the assessment of kidney involvement is \ndetermined. Serum alkaline phosphatase should \nbe always included in the list of laboratory ex-\naminations as the best marker of liver sarcoidosis \n(experts do not present their opinion for or against \nroutine transaminases testing). Complete blood \ncell count as an initial screening for hematologi-\ncal abnormalities (conditional recommendations, \nevidence of very low quality) is suggested in all \npatients. The only one strong recommendation in \nthe entire document concerns the examination of \nserum calcium levels for abnormal calcium metab-\nolism, which is recommended to all patients with \nsarcoid diagnosis (including those who have no \nsymptoms or other signs of hypercalcemia) (strong \nrecommendation, evidence of very low quality).\nIf the assessment of vitamin D metabolism is \nconsidered necessary in a patient with sarcoid-\nosis, for instance in patients with indications for \nsupplementation therapy, testing of both: 25 and \n1.25-OH vitamin D is suggested (conditional \nrecommendation, evidence of very low quality).\nTo all patients with sarcoidosis who do not \nhave cardiac symptoms, a resting electrocardi-\nography (ECG) is recommended as a screening \ntest for cardiac involvement (conditional recom-\nmendation, evidence of very low quality). If the \npatient has no cardiac symptoms, it is suggested \nthat  routine baseline echocardiography (ECHO) \nor outpatient 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring \n(conditional recommendation, evidence of very \nlow quality) is NOT performed. The panel of ex-\nperts concluded that the final decision whether or \nnot to perform ECHO and Holter ECG should be \nconsidered individually in each case (conditional \nrecommendation, evidence of very low quality).\nDiagnostics in patients with sarcoidosis \nof suspected extrapulmonary disease\nIn patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis who \nare suspected of cardiac involvement — cardiac \nmagnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is suggested \nas a test of choice rather than cardiac positron \nemission tomography (cPET) or ECHO to obtain \nboth, diagnostic and prognostic information. In \ncases where an MRI examination of the heart is not \npossible (due to lack of access to the equipment \nor contraindications to the procedure), it is sug-\ngested that  cPET (conditional recommendations, \nevidence of very low quality) is performed.\nTo patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis who \nare suspected of having pulmonary hypertension \n(PH), an ECHO test is suggested  (conditional rec-\nommendation, evidence of very low quality). The \nPH suspicion is made up of clinical symptoms, \nincluding exercise pain in the chest and/or faint-\ning, shortened distance in a 6-minute walk test, \ndesaturation during exercise, in addition, results \nof additional tests indicating reduced lung trans-\nfer factor for carbon monoxide (TL,CO), enlarged \npulmonary artery diameter relative to ascending \naorta diameter assessed in chest computed tomog-\nraphy (CT), increased brain natriuretic peptide \n(BNP) and/or the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.\nTo definitively confirm or exclude PH in \npatients diagnosed with sarcoidosis in whom \nECHO result is suggestive of PH, right heart cath-\neterization (RHC) is suggested (conditional rec-\nommendation, very low-quality evidence). In the \nabsence of suggestive echocardiographic changes \nfor PH, individual indications for diagnostic RHC \nshould be considered (recommendation based on \nbest clinical practice).\nCritical remarks and conclusion\nThe question whether a biopsy is necessary \nin all patients suspected of sarcoidosis has been \ndiscussed for many years among all experts in \nthe field, and this discussion usually results in \nvast spectrum of diverse opinions. Although the \nmajority admits that strongly suggestive clinical \nsymptoms (i.e. Lofgren syndrome), in addition to \nclear and doubtless radiological signs of bilateral \nlymphadenopathy, firmly support the diagnosis, \nthe recommendation does not give a “one-fits-all” \nanswer to this question. Erythema nodosum is not \na specific sign of sarcoidosis, and among a long \nlist of potential causes, one can find lymphoma \nand tuberculosis — both possibly presenting \nwith mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The value \nof proper evaluation of radiological signs has not \nbeen stressed in the document strongly enough. \nThe recommendation to postpone a biopsy in \na patient with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy \nseems to be valid only in individuals with evi-\ndently predominant bilateral enlargement of hilar \nlymph nodes, and in case of atypical configuration \n(i.e. predominance of non-hilar lymphadenopathy \nor asymmetry), the decision of a biopsy should \nbe sustained. The authors of the guidelines use \nthe term “mediastinal lymphadenopathy” not \nassuming an attitude to the presence or absence \nof coexisting parenchymal disease. These axillary \nfeatures may either increase or decrease the di-\nagnostic anxiety. Clearly enough, we do not have \nmuch evidence to answer such a question. EBUS \nis recommended but the question arises whether \nthe presence of few epithelioid cells in the cyto-\nlogical examination indeed allows for exclusion \nMagdalena M Martusewicz-Boros, Wojciech J Piotrowski, Diagnosis of sarcoidosis — the updated ATS 2020\n295\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nof cancer-related sarcoid-like reaction or lympho-\nma? How to secure the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in \nview of the evidence that many patients suffering \nfrom tuberculosis and presenting with lymph-\nadenopathy show non-caseating granulomas in \nthe biopsy? The necessity of close monitoring \n(clearly emphasized by the guidelines’ authors) \nand education of patients about the possible \nsymptoms suggestive of alternative and much \nmore dangerous diseases, possibly hiding under \nthe mask of sarcoidosis, is of special importance. \nTo conclude, individual approach is a key issue. \nDoctor’s experience in the field is also extremely \nimportant, therefore, the best solution is to set \nup reference centers for sarcoidosis in order to \nminimize the risk of improper diagnosis.\nThe document does not discuss the impor-\ntance of biopsies from bronchi or transbronchial \nbiopsies (forceps or cryobiopsies). Obtaining \nconfirmation of sarcoid granuloma from more \nthan one organ significantly increases the prob-\nability of a correct diagnosis. Bronchoalveolar \nlavage (BAL), still routinely used in many centers \nworldwide, and a potential value of flow cytome-\ntry in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis have not been \ndiscussed either.\nThe recommendation concerning screening \nexaminations does not cover all routine tests that \nare usually performed in sarcoid patients. There \nare several unanswered questions like the fol-\nlowing: are spirometry and TL,CO necessary in all \npatients? Should abdominal ultrasonography be \nperformed for screening of abdominal locations \nin all patients? What is the value of chest CT in \nthe initial evaluation, and when should it be used \nfor monitoring? And last but not least, have we \nforgotten about the assessment of disease activi-\nty? Is it still important? In which patients? What \nabout biomarkers (ACE, sR-IL2, neopterin etc.) or \nimaging techniques like PET or scintigraphy? The \nlist of unanswered questions is probably much \nlonger, and problems may be different depending \non the local conditions, related to disease pop-\nulation characteristics, health system resources \nand organization.\nThe authors’ own experience is in line with \nthe indication of the cMRI as the superior method \nin assessing the involvement of this organ, after \nconfirming sarcoid changes in the pathomorpho-\nlogical examination of lymph nodes, the lung or \nother organs. MRI allows both morphological and \nfunctional assessment, providing it is conducted \naccording to an adequate protocol. At this point, \nit is worth emphasizing that diagnostic success \nis not dependent on the possibility of performing \nthe test, i.e. access to appropriate hardware and \nsoftware, but primarily depends on the substan-\ntive preparation of the person who carries out and \nevaluates the test.\nIn conclusion, the ATS panel of experts \nadopted one strong recommendation regarding \nthe evaluation of serum calcemia, 13 condition-\nal recommendations and one recommendation \nresulting from clinical practice (“best practice \nstatement”). The strength of the recommendation \nregarding the assessment of serum calcemia is \nof great practical importance as significant hy-\npercalcemia may be a life-threatening condition. \nTherefore, such assessment should take place in \nevery patient at the stage of initial diagnosis, as \nwell as in further monitoring of disease course. \nOne should always regard a biopsy confirmation \nof sarcoid granuloma as a diagnostic standard, \nconsidering not only mediastinal lymph nodes \nas a biopsy site but also other techniques like \nbronchial biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, and \nother easily accessible locations like peripheral \nlymph nodes. Only in patients with highly sug-\ngestive clinical symptoms and typical radiological \nfeatures, the biopsy may be postponed under the \ncondition that close monitoring of disease course \nmay be secured. The lack of a recommendation \nregarding the necessity of performing lymph \nnode biopsies in a patient with asymptomatic \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy reflects the lack \nof sufficiently valuable evidence to support its \nperformance in all patients. Regression of changes \nin subsequent imaging exams and a stable radio-\nlogical image over a 2-year period exempt from \nthe obligation of biopsy. In a situation when we \ndecide to discontinue a biopsy, it is necessary to \ninform the patient about the need of systematic \nmonitoring of the disease course. The patient \nshould receive information on the symptoms \nthat may indicate the need for deepening and \nreevaluation of the diagnosis. \nThe authors agree with the position of ATS \nexperts that there is an urgent need for higher \nquality evidence that would support clinical prac-\ntice in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, which would \nhelp to better understand and define the natural \ncourse of the disease. Nevertheless, the document \npublished by ATS is a valuable proposition of the \ncurrent standard of sarcoidosis diagnosis, based \non an objective analysis and currently available \ndata. Despite having ATS recommendations, \nlocal societies should undertake an effort of pre-\nparing similar documents, asking more detailed \nand specific questions that would consider local \nconditions.\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 293–296\n296\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences:\n1.\t Statement on sarcoidosis.

This paper is the analysis of hospitalisations for \nchronic respiratory diseases recorded in Polish National Health Fund databases in 2014.\nMaterial and methods: The study included 122,000 hospitalisations of adults and 22,000 hospitalisations of children. Epidemio-\nlogical parameters (incidence and prevalence) and major hospitalisation parameters were determined through statistical analysis. \nResults: The highest registered incidence was observed in asthma patients (548 per 100,000 inhabitants) followed by COPD \npatients (233 per 100,000 inhabitants). Asthma patients were also characterised by the highest prevalence, with lower values \nbeing observed in COPD patients. In the group of adults, patients aged 65 years or older and 80 years or older accounted for 44% \nand 14% of hospitalised adults respectively. The analysis also revealed that 66% of hospitalisations of adults included patients \nwith asthma, COPD and respiratory failure. The development of respiratory failure prolongs hospitalisation and increases both \nin-hospital and post-discharge mortality. In children, 90% of the identified hospitalisations were for asthma, chronic inflammatory \nlung diseases and cystic fibrosis. \nConclusions: The results of the study demonstrate that pulmonary obstructive diseases are associated with a considerable \nburden. Therefore, corrective actions within the Polish healthcare system are required to decrease the number of hospitalisations \nfor these diseases.\nKey words: Maps of Health Needs, hospitalisations, chronic respiratory diseases\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 297–304\nIntroduction \nAccording to the “European Lung White \nBook” 600,000 people die from respiratory diseas-\nes in Europe each year, meaning that one in eight \ndeaths is caused by them [1]. A total of 6 million \nhospitalisations due to respiratory diseases are \nrecorded each year.\nEpidemiological studies have shown that at \nleast 1/3 of the population aged 5–80 years is at \nan increased risk of asthma, a lifetime risk for \ndeveloping COPD in smokers is 40–50%, and lung \ncancer causes 20% of cancer-related deaths [1]. \nUntil recently, cystic fibrosis (CF), a multi-organ \ngenetic disease, was considered a childhood \ndisease. Currently, however, as many as 42% of \nCF patients survive until the age of 18, and 5% \n— until 40 years of age. \nThe “Maps of Health Needs” project (www.\nmpz.mz.gov.pl/), co-financed by the European \nSocial Fund (ESF) as part of the Operational Pro-\ngramme Knowledge Education Development, is \na project whose goals to implement quality-pro-\nmoting activities and organisational solutions in \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 297–304\n298\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nthe Polish healthcare system are in line with the \ntrend of health promotion, in accordance with \nthe Ottawa Charter [2].\nThe project resulted in the creation of a system \nfor mapping health needs within 30 groups of dis-\neases and in the development of a base for systemic \nand implementation analyses within this scope. \nThe aim of this study was to analyse hospi-\ntal management of selected chronic respiratory \ndiseases. \nMaterial and methods\nStudy population \nThe study population comprised all patients \nin Poland in whom a hospitalisation was reported \nin 2014 due to the following diagnoses (ICD-10) \nbeing part of chronic respiratory diseases:\n1.\t\nAsthma (J45, J46);\n2.\t\nCOPD (J43, J44);\n3.\t\nCystic fibrosis (CF) (E84);\n4.\t\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) (D86, J60–J67, \nJ70, J82, J84, J99);\n5.\t\nSleep-disordered breathing (SDB) (G47);\n6.\t\nChronic inflammatory lung diseases (J40–J42, \nJ47);\n7.\t\nRespiratory failure (J96).\nPatients treated in the drug programme were \nexcluded from the analysis of asthma. While an \nadditional group of persons hospitalised for lung \ncancer was distinguished, it was not further ana-\nlysed in detail since these patients often undergo \ndiagnostic evaluation in respiratory wards, but in \nthe Polish healthcare system they are treated in \nsurgical and cancer wards.\nData collection \nThe data used in this study were derived \nfrom the payment reconciliation database of the \npublic payer in the Polish healthcare system \n[NFZ (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia) — National \nHealth Fund]. In Poland, payments for healthcare \nservices are settled by the NFZ in accordance \nwith the principles of Diagnosis-Related Groups \n(DRGs).

The highest registered prevalence va-\nlues were also observed in patients with asthma, \n­followed by patients with COPD and patients with \nchronic inflammatory lung diseases. \nHospitalisations of adults \nThe patients with COPD, respiratory failure \nand asthma accounted for 66% of the hospitali-\nsations (Table 2). The subjects with COPD were \ncharacterised by the highest number of hospita-\nlisations, the highest number of hospitalisations \nper patient (1.2) and the highest mean patient \nage, while as many as 29% of the hospitalised \npatients were those aged 85 years or older. The \ndevelopment of respiratory failure increased \nALOS to 11.4 days.\nThe highest ALOS (12 days) was observed in \nthe group of patients with CF, while the average \nnumber of hospitalisations per patient with CF \nwas 2.2. This was the youngest and the smallest \ngroup among all hospitalised persons. \nHospitalisations of children\nThe cumulative percent of the number of \nhospitalisations showed that the reason for ad-\nmission to hospital was asthma, chronic inflam-\nmatory lung diseases and CF in 90% of the ho-\nspitalised children (Table 3). The highest number \nof hospitalisations per patient was observed in \npatients with CF. The highest ALOS was found \nin patients with respiratory failure. \nDeaths in adults \nThe development of respiratory failure led \nto 23% of in-hospital deaths, while 30% of the \npatients died within 30 days and 36% within \n90 days after hospital discharge (Table 4). In the \ncase of COPD patients, in-hospital deaths consti-\ntuted 3%, whereas 6% of the patients died within \n30 days and 10% within 90 days after hospital \ndischarge (Table 4).\nDeaths in children \nThe development of respiratory failure in \nchildren was also associated with the highest \nin-hospital mortality (5%), while 7% and 9% of \nthem died within 30 and 90 days after hospital \ndischarge, respectively. With regard to CF pa-\ntients, 1% of deaths within 30 days after hospital \ndischarge was observed.\nDiscussion \nThis publication discusses the burden of \nhospitalisations for chronic respiratory diseases \non the Polish healthcare system. \nThe analysed data concerned hospitalisations \nfor which the diagnosis of chronic respiratory \ndisease was the first to be reported with an ICD-\n10 code.\nIt should, however, be emphasised that the \nmethod and order of ICD-10 coding may be the \nsource of a reporting error [3] — an example can \nbe the reporting of pneumonia in a patient with \nCOPD using only one code. \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 297–304\n300\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nTable 2.

Patients suffering from asthma \nwere also characterised by the highest prevalence, \nwhile lower values were observed in individuals \nwith COPD. \nThe cumulative percent of the number of \nhospitalisations showed that asthma, COPD and \nrespiratory failure were responsible for 66% of \nhospitalisations of adults. The highest number of \nadult patients was hospitalised for COPD. Regard-\nless of the underlying disease, the development \nof respiratory failure leads to the deterioration of \nthe prognosis, prolongation of hospitalisation and \nincrease in both in-hospital and post-discharge \nmortality. \nAsthma, chronic inflammatory lung diseases \nand CF accounted for 90% of children’s hospital-\nisations. Asthma was the reason for the highest \nnumber of hospitalisations. In children with CF, \nthere was a relatively lower number of hospital-\nisations per patient. Respiratory failure prolonged \nthe length of hospital stay significantly and was \nassociated with higher mortality. \nRespiratory system diseases are a complex, \nmedical and economic problem in every country \n[1, 4–6]. The analysis of respiratory diseases, \nconducted in the United Kingdom, demonstrated \nthat 12.7 million British individuals had a history \nof asthma, COPD or another chronic respiratory \ndisease [6]. It is widely accepted that 50% of \ndeaths and 25% of hospitalisations are caused by \ntobacco-related diseases, including lung cancer \nor COPD. \nIn 2011, a total of 694,000 hospitalisations \nwere reported, 8% of which were for diseases of \nthe respiratory system. Respiratory system diseas-\nes were the reason for 703,116 (8.3%) of hospital-\nisations, which translated into 6,167,509 patient \ndays (10%). \nThe authors of the publication noted that the \npatient age significantly affected the percentage \nof hospitalisations in relation to a given diagno-\nsis. Therefore, in children aged up to 14 years, \n23.4% of the hospitalisations resulted from con-\ngenital anomalies and respiratory complications \nassociated with them — 18% were for asthma and \n1.9% were for CF.\nAt ages 15–64 years, asthma accounted for \n15.5% of the hospitalisations, COPD — 18.2%, CF \n— 3.1%, and lung cancer — 7.1%. In patients aged \n65 years or older, asthma accounted for as little \nas 2.2% of the hospitalisations, COPD — 26.5%, \nand lung cancer — 7.8%. \nThe number of hospitalisations for COPD was \n43,134, which corresponded to 350,512 patient \ndays, while ALOS was 8.1 days. In the UK anal-\nysis, there were 204,798 hospitalisations (2.4%), \nwhich corresponded to 2,346,324 (3.8%) patient \ndays [6].\nMany foreign analyses point to the burden of \nhospitalisations for COPD on healthcare systems \neven though incidence and hospital morbidity \nrates vary considerably. For instance, Oceania \nand, particularly, Australia and New Zealand, \nhave a more considerable burden of hospitalisa-\ntion than Poland [7, 8].\nIn New Zealand, the burden of hospital-\nisations for COPD varies by region and ranges \nfrom 410 per 100,000 inhabitants to 1,144 per \n100,000 inhabitants [7].\nIn 2010, prevalence in Australia constituted \n317 hospitalisations per 100,000 inhabitants [8].\nIn the Australian and New Zealand statistics \nalike, there was a significant impact of socio-\neconomic status on hospital morbidity, longer \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 297–304\n302\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nhospitalisations and more frequent hospital re-\nadmissions [7, 8].\nIt should be emphasised that patients aged \n65 years or older are a significant burden on hos-\npitals. This paper reveals that the percentage of \npatients aged 65 years or older as well as patients \nreaching 80 years or older accounted for 86% and \n29%, respectively.\nIn addition, this study showed that hos-\npitalisations for COPD translated into 3% of \nin-hospital deaths, 6% of deaths within 30 days \nand 10% of deaths within 90 days after hospital \ndischarge. The development of respiratory failure \nincreases these percentages to 23%, 30% and 36%, \nrespectively. \nThe issue of increased mortality after acute \nexacerbations of COPD was already considered \nseveral years ago [9–11]. A previous acute exac-\nerbation requiring hospitalisation is known to be \na significant risk factor for hospital readmission, \nwhereas the risk of death increases seven-fold \n[11]. The study by Groenwegen et al. found \nthat 8% of acute exacerbations of COPD led to \nin-hospital deaths and 23% of such patients died \nwithin one year after hospital discharge [9]. Re-\nspiratory failure leading to hospitalisation in an \nintensive care unit increases the death rate within \none year after hospital discharge to 35%. The risk \nfactors include: treatment with oral corticostero-\nids; hypercapnia; old age.\nEven though a Danish study conducted be-\ntween 2002–2008 demonstrated the reduction \nof the annual hospitalisation rate from 460 per \n100,000 inhabitants in 2002 to 410 per 100,000 in-\nhabitants in 2008 [10], the increase in in-hospital \nmortality [odds ratio (OR) — 1.16] and increased \npost-discharge mortality rate within one year \n(OR — 1.12) were also observed. Increased morta-\nlity was primarily found in patients with respira-\ntory failure and multiple comorbidities; however, \nthe distance to the hospital and treatment with \noral corticosteroids — as in the case of the study \nby Groenwegen et al. — were also of relevance \nthere. Bed occupancy also contributed to the \nadverse outcome of treatment. It was found that \nthe decrease in the number of hospitals and beds \nresulted in the centralisation of hospitalisations \nfor more severe cases of the disease. In the authors’ \nopinion, this organisational change improved the \nprehospital care of patients with COPD.\nThe decrease in hospitalisations by 14% was \nalso noted after a smoking ban had been introdu-\nced in Spain [12].\nIn 2014, a total of 46,000 hospitalisations \nfor asthma were reported in Poland, including \n29,000 of hospitalised adults and 17,600 of hos-\npitalised children. Hospital morbidity rates con-\nstituted 92 per 100,000 inhabitants in adults and \n253 per 100,000 inhabitants in children. In adults, \nthe majority of the hospitalisations (18,000) were \nin lung disease and tuberculosis wards, followed \nby internal medicine wards (7,500) and allergy \nwards (3,500). The median lengths of stay varied \nby province and ranged from 3 to 6 days. Five \npercent of adult patients with asthma were hos-\npitalised for more than 14 days. Acute severe \nasthma (status asthmaticus) (J46) was reported \nin the patients with asthma and ranged from 1% \nin the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship to 13% \nin the Łódź Voivodeship.\nThis analysis merely shows the burden of \nasthma on the Polish healthcare system, which \nhas been revealed by reporting activities, and \nmay contain some errors due to incorrect diag-\nnosis and incorrect reporting of an obstructive \nrespiratory disease (asthma, COPD or coexis-\ntence of both). It is also important to differen-\ntiate between a hospitalisation for diagnostic \nevaluation of a disease and an acute exacerba-\ntion requiring hospitalisation. The unavailabil-\nity of specialist outpatient care in the patients’ \nlocal health centres often leads to unnecessary \nhospitalisations. \nIt should be noted that the number of patients \nregistered in the NFZ databases has been relative-\nly constant since 2009, with a predominance of \nwomen (115%) [13]. Approximately 55–57% of \nthe registered patients live in urban areas, and \n43–45% live in rural areas.\nThe GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) \ndocument provides extensive information that \nsuggests the possibility of controlling the dis-\nease outside the hospital setting (GINA) [5]. It is \nbelieved that the number of hospitalisations for \nasthma is proportionate to decreased disease con-\ntrol [14]. A considerable number of factors affects \nasthma control, including as follows: the lack of \na correct diagnosis, undertreatment, patients’ \nnon-compliance, the lack of or non-adherence to \na treatment plan. \nIn Australia, for instance, a 10% reduction in \nthe number of hospitalisations was observed in \n2015 when compared to 2010. In 2015, hospital \nmorbidity averaged 1.85 per 1,000 inhabitants \n(1.93 per 1,000 inhabitants in urban areas and \n1.64 per 1,000 inhabitants in rural areas). The \nauthors point out to the fact that in epidemio-\nlogical studies, optimisation of asthma treatment \nrequires taking age, sex and place of residence \nunder consideration. They stress the role of \nKarina Jahnz-Różyk et al., Maps of Health Needs chronic respiratory diseases\n303\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nprimary care regarding the coordinated care of \npatients with asthma. \nIn Portugal, hospitalisations for asthma ac-\ncounted for 2.5 per 1,000 hospitalisations, 28.1 per \n100,000 inhabitants (66.6 per 100,000 individuals \naged below 19 years) [16]. In-hospital deaths were \nestimated at 8 per 1,000 hospitalisations, corre-\nsponding to 2.4 per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Mor-\ntality statistics remain unchanged. \nHospitalisations of children with asthma \nmerit a separate discussion. The diagnosis of \nasthma is more difficult to make in a child than \nin an adult for various reasons, which include \nthe multiplicity of non-specific symptoms in the \nformer. Many asthma phenotypes, including the \nwheezing phenotype, are particularly difficult \nto differentiate from asthma in this group of \npatients. Wheezing is a common symptom (espe-\ncially in younger children) of many respiratory \ndiseases, which causes that it is particularly diffi-\ncult to differentiate it from asthma. It is often the \ncase that children are hospitalised for bronchitis \nor bronchiolitis (the so-called wheezing babies), \nwhich is subsequently coded as asthma. \nTo sum up, the problem of hospitalisation for \nasthma in Poland includes:\n— \t Conditions of the healthcare system;\n— \t No asthma control, resulting from the lack of \ninsufficient diagnosis and undertreatment of \nthe disease; \n— \t Differences in the diagnosis and treatment of \nasthma in children; \n— \t Incorrect diagnosis (the lack of differentiation \nof asthma from COPD); \n— \t A high proportion of smokers;\n— \t Disease coding and reporting to the NFZ;\n— \t Differences in coverage of medicines intend-\ned for the treatment of obstructive pulmonary \ndiseases.\nIt is also important to consider statistical \ndifferences depending on the country in which \nthe analysis is conducted: in Norway, the number \nof hospitalisations of children decreased by 51%, \nwhile it remained unchanged in Sweden [17]. \nAccording to the “European Lung White \nBook,” the prevalence of asthma is estimated at \n1.6–20% in Europe, whereas 60% of patients with \nallergies are mainly allergic to animal hair, dust \nand mould, including 10–20% of them have the \nwheezing phenotype that is difficult to differen-\ntiate [1].\nDue to the complex clinical presentation of \nCF and multidirectional treatment, the quality \nof care provided to CF patients, as measured by \nlifespan, is considered one of the best indicators \nof healthcare quality in developed countries \n[18–20].\nThe most recent US studies have revealed \nthat life expectancy of people born in 2010 is \n40 years for females and 37 years for males [18].\nIn Poland, average lifespan of CF patients \nis shorter than that in Western Europe and the \nUnited States. Cystic fibrosis, a disease once con-\nsidered a childhood one, currently affects adults \nas well (who only account for approx. 1/3 of all \nCF patients). Patients with CF account for 1% of \nhospitalisations of adults (with the mean age of \n25 years) and 8% of hospitalisations of children \n(with the mean age of 8 years).\nIt is thus justified to follow the example of \nthe rest of Europe by making attempts to establish \nCF treatment centres and to provide CF patients \nwith comprehensive and multidisciplinary care. \nHospitalisations for CF occur at any age and \nthe main reason is deterioration of lung function \n[20]. The most common management strategy \ninvolves intravenous antibiotic therapy, clean-\nsing of the respiratory tract through appropriate \ninhalation and drainage therapy combined with \nan appropriate diet. Pulmonary rehabilitation \nis the key to the beneficial outcome of hospita-\nlisation. \nThe registry of CF patients in the United Sta-\ntes included 21,488 patients in 2003 and 28,134 in \n2013, as well as collected data on hospitalisa-\ntions [18]. The number of hospitalisations per \n1,000 CF patients increased from 994 to 1,072 in \n2013. During hospitalisation, 1.5% of the patients \naged 27 years on average died (MLOS — 7 days). \nBetween 2003 and 2013, mortality decreased from \n1.9% to 1.2%. The risk factors included: chronic \nliver disease, acute kidney disease, and previous \nlung transplantation (6.5% of the hospitalisa-\ntions). Keeping registries of CF patients contri-\nbutes to improved patient care and to the pursuit \nof novel — often individualised — treatments. \nConclusions\nThis publication serves as evidence that ho-\nspitalisations for asthma and COPD, especially \nthose complicated by respiratory failure, consti-\ntute a serious burden on the Polish healthcare sys-\ntem. In accordance with the project assumptions, \norganisational and implementation-related ac-\ntions have to be taken to reduce this burden. \nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 297–304\n304\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nReferences:\n1.\t European Lung White Book, 2018.

ACCs are uncommon yet a malignant form \nof neoplasms that arises within the secretory glands. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the increase of mTOR in \nthe ACC tumors in order to survey the possibility of treating these tumors with mTOR inhibitors.\nMaterial and methods: Samples from known cases of the lung and tracheal ACC were retrieved from the archives of the pa-\nthology department of Masih Daneshvari hospital, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for mTOR was performed on them. \nAfter preparation of the blocks with specific antibodies, tumor cells with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear expression of mTOR were \nconsidered as positive cells by applying a specific scoring method introduced in this study.\nResults: The paraffin blocks of 26 patients were surveyed and the IHC marker of mTOR was positive in the tumors of 10 patients \n(38.5%). Out of 10 mTOR positive cases, 5 were females and 5 were males. The primary site of the surveyed tumors was the \ntrachea and bronchus in 12 cases (46%), salivary glands in 7 individuals (27%), and lung tissue in 7 cases (27%), and there was no \nsignificant correlation between the primary site of the ACC tumors and the existence of the mTOR markers in them (P = 0.67). From \nall cases, 13 patients (50%) had cribriform and tubular cells without solid components, 9 cases (34.6%) had cribriform and tubular \nwith less than 30% of solid components, and 4 cases (15.4%) had cribriform and tubular cells with more than 30% of solid com-\nponents. There was no significant difference between the morphologies and the existence of mTOR markers in them (P = 0.741).\nConclusions: As the incidence of mTOR markers is seen in patients with tracheal ACC, evaluation and scoring of mTOR in these \npersons can be helpful as further studies can distinguish the use of it in the treatment of the disease.\nKey words: immunohistochemistry, adenoid cystic carcinoma, mTOR\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 305–312\nIntroduction\nThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) \nas a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the \nphosphoinositide 3 kinase-related kinase (PIKK) \nfamily is expressed in most mammalian cells \nto control growth and metabolism [1–5]. The \nmTOR1 and mTOR2 complexes are involved in \nnormal cell growth and developmental process \nand are crucial for its viability by regulating the \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 305–312\n306\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nkinases of the AGC family, protein synthesis and \nautophagy [6]; accordingly, their dysregulation \nis implicated in the pathophysiology of several \ndiseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and \nneurodegeneration [7]. \nThere is a correlation between the activation \nof mTOR signaling and aggressive tumor growth \nin many cancers [8]. As a matter of fact, after the \nhyperactivation of mTOR signaling, the tumors \ngrow at an increased rate and they are less likely \nto disappear because of an increased amount of \nprotein synthesis and inhibition of autophagy \n[9, 10]. Also, the activated mTOR pathway helps \nproliferation, migration, and survival of tumor \ncells, which increases the tumor invasiveness \n[11]. In addition, this pathway reduces the tumor \ncells sensitivity to chemotherapy and hormonal \ntreatment [12]. Hence, inhibition of its activity \nincreases the chemotherapy effectiveness and \nimproves the outcome of the treatment of these \ntumors [13]. The natural inhibitor of mTOR is \nrapamycin. Temsirolimus and everolimus are \nother important inhibitors whose effectiveness \nin the treatment of different cancers has been \nproven [13, 14].\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) as an ag-\ngressive neoplasm of salivary glands is the \nsecond most common primary malignancy of \ntracheal neoplasm, in whose pathophysiology the \nmTOR pathway may be involved [15]. Although \nthe incidence of this tumor is low, about 90% of \nthem are malignant [16]. The treatment of the \npatients with ACC includes surgical resection of \nthe tumors with their margins and reconstruc-\ntion, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy [17], and \nas mentioned, if the marker of the mTOR pathway \nis high in these tumors, using the mTOR inhib-\nitors may increase the chemotherapy effective-\nness. The aim of this study was to investigate the \nincidence of mTOR in the ACC tumors in order \nto survey the possibility of treating them with \nmTOR inhibitors.\nMaterial and methods\nThe samples of the Pathology department of \nMasih Daneshvari hospital were searched for ACC \ntumors of the trachea with diagnosis confirmed \nbetween 2010 and 2014, with the approval of the \ninstitutional review board. Then, paraffin blocks \nof known cases of the ACC of the lung and tra-\nchea (primary and metastatic carcinoma) were \nretrieved from the archives of the department and \nreviewed by two different pathologists without \nknowledge of the initial diagnosis.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFormalin-fixed paraffin blocks of known cases \nof the ACC of the lung and trachea were used in \nour study. In brief, following dewaxing, washing \nand rehydration of the slides through xylene and \ngraded alcohols, microwave heating in citrate buf-\nfer were used for antigen retrieval. Endogenous \nperoxidase was blocked in ChemMate peroxi-\ndase-blocking solution (Dako). Phospho-mTOR \n(Ser2448) — Cell Signalling #2976, monoclonal \nrabbit, dilution 1:50 was the main antibody and \nEnVision™ Dual Link System (Dako) was used as \na detection system [18].\nA positive immunohistochemical reaction \nwas indicated by brown cytoplasmic and/or \nnuclear staining. Cases were scored on the basis \nof the visually estimated percentage of tumor \ncells with positive cytoplasmic and/or nuclear \nstaining.\nScoring\nAfter the staining, tumor cells with cytoplas-\nmic and/or nuclear expression of mTOR were \nconsidered as positive cells according to the \nscoring method presented below:\n1.\t\nIn the regions with the highest density of \npositive cells for each slide, the percentage of \npositive cells in 5 separate fields which had \n≥1000 adjacent cells were counted and scored \nas: percentage of positive cells less than 1%: \n0, between 1% and 25%: 1, 26% to 50%: 2, \n51% to 75%: 3, 76% to 100: 4 (Table 1).\n2.\t\nThe color intensity of the stained blocks was \nscored based on color intensity as follows: \nlack of brown 0, mild: 1, moderate: 2, severe: \n3 (Table 2).\n3.\t\nThe two obtained points for each tissue were \nmultiplied to calculate the final scores (max-\nimum score: 12) and the final scores were \ncategorized into: 0-1: negative for mTOR, \n2-3: weakly positive for mTOR, 4-6: positive \nTable 1.\t Scoring of the percentage of positive cells\nThe percentage of positive cells\nScore\n< 1%\n0\n1–25%\n1\n26–50%\n2\n51–75%\n3\n76–100%\n4\nPhuuwadith Wattanachayakul et al., COPD is associated with high serum uric acid\n307\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nfor mTOR, 7–12: strongly positive for mTOR \n(Table 3).\n4.\t\nFor statistical analysis, the samples were \ndivided into two groups: positive for mTOR \nmarker (final score > 3) and negative for \nmTOR marker (final score ≤ 3).\nStatistical analysis\nThe data was analyzed using SPSS V22 soft-\nware and an ANOVA test followed by a Chi-square \ntest, a T-test and a Fisher’s exact test.\nResults\nIn the study, a total number of 32 patients \nwith adenoid cystic carcinoma were reviewed by \npathologists. Six patients were excluded due to \nthe prior history of radiotherapy. Finally, the par-\naffin blocks of 26 subjects were surveyed (Table 4) \nand the immunohistochemistry (IHC) marker of \nthe mTOR expression was positive in the tumors \nof 10 patients (38.5%). From 10 mTOR positive \ncases in immunohistochemistry surveys, 5 were \nfemales and 5 were males. Also, negative cases for \nmTOR were seen equally among men and women. \nTherefore, there was no difference between men \nand women in the existence of mTOR markers in \nthe ACC tumors (Table 4). \nThe mean age of patients was 53.12 ± \n15.3 and 57.7% of them (n = 15) had a mean \nage of 50 years or older (Table 4). There was no \nsignificant correlation between the existence of \nmTOR markers in ACC tumors and the age of the \npatients (P = 0.48).\nThe primary site of the surveyed tumors was \nthe trachea and bronchus in 12 cases (46%), sal-\nivary glands in 7 cases (27%), and lung tissue in \n7 cases (27%) (Table 4). The frequency of mTOR \npositive patients based on the primary site of \nthe tumors are summarized in Table 5. The per-\ncentage of mTOR positive cases in tracheal and \nbronchial tumors was 41.7%, in salivary gland \ntumors was 28.6%, and in lung tumors was 42.8%. \nIn the study, there was no significant correlation \nbetween the primary site of the ACC tumors and \nthe existence of mTOR markers (P = 0.67).\nTable 2.\t Scoring of the color intensity of the tissue frag-\nments\nColor intensity\nScore\nLack of brown\n0\nMild\n1\nModerate \n2\nSevere \n3\nTable 3.\t The existence of mTOR markers according to \nthe final scores\nFinal score\nThe existence of mTOR\n0, 1\nNegative for mTOR\n2, 3\nWeakly positive for mTOR (+)\n4–6\nPositive for mTOR (++)\n7–12\nStrongly positive for mTOR (+++)\nTable 4.\t Demographic information, tumor location, mTOR existence and morphology of tumor cells\nVariable\nNumber of ACC\nPercentage\nP value*\nGender\nMale\nFemale\n13\n13\n50\n50\n1\nAge\n< 50 years old\n> 50 years old\n11\n15\n42.3\n57.7\n0.48\nThe primary site \nof the tumors\nTrachea and bronchus\nSalivary glands\nLung\n12\n7\n7\n46\n27\n27\n0.67\nType of tumor\nPrimary\nMetastatic\n20\n6\n77\n23\n0.457\nmTOR existence\nPositive\nNegative\n10\n16\n38.5\n61.5\nN/A\nMorphology\nMorphology**\nMorphology***\nMorphology****\n13\n9\n4\n50\n34.6\n15.4\n0.741\n*P value for comparing variables based on the existence of mTOR marker; **cribriform and tubular cells without solid components; ***cribriform and tubular with less \nthan 30% of solid components; ****cribriform and tubular cells with more than 30% of solid components\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 305–312\n308\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nAmong these tumors, 20 tumors (77%) were \nthe primary tumors and only 6 of them (23%) \nwere metastases from other sites (4 cases with \nmetastasis from salivary glands and 2 cases with \nmetastasis from the trachea) (Table 4). From the \nmTOR positive cases, 8 of them (40%) were prima-\nry tumors and only 2 of them (33.3%) were met-\nastatic tumors (Table 6). There was no significant \ndifference between metastatic or primary tumors \nin the existence of mTOR markers (P = 0.457).\nIn terms of the morphology of tumor cells, \n13 cases (50%) had cribriform and tubular cells \nwithout solid components (morphology 1), 9 cases \n(34.6%) had cribriform and tubular with less than \n30% of solid components (morphology 2), and \n4 cases (15.4%) had cribriform and tubular cells \nwith more than 30% of solid components (mor-\nphology 3). There was no significant difference \nbetween different morphologies in the existence \nof mTOR markers (P = 0.741). Different morpholo-\ngies of the ACC tumor cells are shown in Figure 1.\nAlso, in the study, we investigated the site of \nthe staining (Figure 2) in the tumor cells (cyto-\nplasmic, nuclear, or both cytoplasmic and nucle-\nar) based on the three types of morphology - the \nresults are summarized in Table 7. Out of 10 pa-\ntients who were considered positive (3 < final \nscore), 4 had nuclear staining, 4 had cytoplasmic \nstaining and 2 had both nuclear and cytoplasmic \nstaining. Also, out of the 16 patients who were \nconsidered negative (3 > final score), 8 had no \nstaining, 7 had cytoplasmic staining, 1 had both \nnuclear and cytoplasmic staining, but none had \nnuclear staining. \nDiscussion\nThis study was conducted to investigate the \nincidence of mTOR in the paraffin blocks of the \npatients with ACC tumors using immunohisto-\nchemistry technique. According to our surveys, \nthe IHC marker of mTOR expression was posi-\ntive in the tumors of 10 cases (38.5%) out of the \n26 surveyed. In a similar study by Wang Li et al., \nthe mTOR marker in non-small cell lung cancer in \n43.5% of 78 patients was positive [19]. Also, in the \nstudy by Meiling Wen et al. about the importance \nof mTOR expression in patients with colon cancer, \nout of 106 subjects with this cancer, 80 patients \n(75.5%) were mTOR positive [20]. It seems that the \ndifferences can be related to the different sample \nsizes, which suggests the need for more studies \nin this regard with larger sample sizes.\nIn addition, out of 10 mTOR positive patients \nin this study, 5 were females and 5 were males, \nand there was no difference between men and \nwomen in the expression of mTOR. The mean \nage of the patients in the study was 53.12 years \nand there was no significant correlation between \nthe existence of mTOR markers and the age of the \npatients (P = 0.48). These results are consistent \nwith the outcomes of the study by Wang et al. \non the expression of mTOR in 210 patients with \nlung cancer and the results of the study of Meiling \nWen et al.; in both studies, it has been shown that \nthere is no significant relationship between the \nexpression of mTOR and age and sex [19, 20].\nIn our study, 20 patients with ACC (77%) \nhad primary tumors and the mTOR marker was \nTable 5.

Hence, there was no significant \ndifference between metastatic or primary tumors \nin the existence of mTOR markers (P = 0.457), \nalthough more studies with larger sample sizes \nare required.\nThe ACC tumors were divided into three \ngroups according to the morphology: cribriform \nand tubular without solid components, cribri-\nform and tubular with less than 30% of solid \ncomponents, and cribriform and tubular with \nmore than 30% of solid components [21]. Of the \n26 patients, 13 cases were in the first group with \n6 (42.8%) mTOR positive patients, 9 in the second \ngroup with 3 (37.5%) mTOR positive cases and \n4 in the third group with 1 (25%) mTOR positive \ncase. Although this difference is not statistically \nsignificant in our study, it seems that there is a re-\nverse correlation between the percentage of solid \ncomponents and the existence of mTOR markers, \nFigure 1. Different morphologies of the ACC tumor cells. A. and B. — cribriform; C. — solid; and D. — tubular\nA\nC\nB\nD\nand according to the direct correlation between \nthe high percentage of the solid component and \nthe grade of cancer, it can be deduced that more \ninvasive ACCs with higher grades have lower \nincidence of mTOR markers. This is consistent \nwith the results of the study by Wang Li et al. that \nhas shown that low-grade and moderate-grade \nneuroendocrine tumors have a higher incidence \nof mTOR markers than high-grade tumors [19]. \nAlthough the incidence of tracheal ACC \ntumors is low, about 90% of them are malignant \n[22], and their diagnosis is delayed due to the \nslow growth rate, and their atypical symptoms \nand patients are misdiagnosed with asthma or \nbronchitis [23]. The everolimus and temsiro-\nlimus are approved as anticancer drugs which \ntargeted the inhibition of the mTOR pathway in \nthe clinic [24].\nThe limitation to the study that is worth men-\ntioning was the restricted number of cases that \nwas due to the rare incidence of the disease.

The site of the staining in the tumor \ncells (nuclear, cytoplasmic, or both), the intensity \nof coloring, and the percentage of positive tumor \ncells were used to present a unique scoring sys-\ntem to be applied in the investigation of mTOR \nmarkers in ACC tumors. The mTOR can be used \nas a target for the treatment of the cancer, and \nin this study, the presence of mTOR marker in \nsome of the ACC patients has been shown. Thus, \nfurther evaluation of using mTOR as suggestive \nindicator for targeted therapy of ACCs and the \neffectivity of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment \nfor these tumors are recommended.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences:\n1.\t Brown E, Albers M, Shin TB, et al.

Inspiratory and expiratory resistive load detection thresholds (ILDT and ELDT respectively) and spirometry \nwere measured.\nResults: The mean (SD) ILDT was 5.93 (7.02) kPa.s/L in COPD patients, compared to 11.11 (8.47) in healthy people (P < 0.001) \nin the same age range. There was no significant correlation between ILDT and age in the COPD group (r = -0.182, P = 0.326), \nthough significant correlation with age was found in healthy people (r = 0.591, P < 0.001). ILDT and ELDT in COPD patients \ncorrelated significantly with the FEV1/FVC ratio (r = 0.367, P = 0.048 and r = 0.481, P = 0.007 respectively) but not with other \nspirometry indices, height, weight, BMI, oxygen saturation or smoking pack-years. \nConclusion: LDT during tidal breathing appears to be sensitized, and thereby lower, in older COPD patients, possibly due to altered \ncentral regulation of the threshold or as a consequence of the effect lung compliance, recoil and volume changes have on afferent \ninput from mechano-receptors in COPD. Older COPD patients with good cognition are therefore likely to be as aware of changing \nairways resistance as younger patients and take appropriate therapeutic action. \nKey words: airflow resistance sensing, ageing, spirometry, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 313–319\nIntroduction\nIn previous studies we showed that the thre-\nshold for the subjective detection of an increase \nin an incrementally applied external resistive \nload to airflow (LDT) during tidal breathing rises \nwith age in a substantial proportion of healthy \npeople and asthmatic patients in remission [1, \n2]. We contended that this had implications for \nelderly patients who might consequently be less \nable to sense the early stages of a relapse in their \nasthma and therefore delay taking appropriate \naction. That argument was consistent with the \ncommonplace clinical experience that older \nasthmatics tend to present later than younger \npatients when they are having an exacerbation. \nFollowing the same logic for the study reported \nin this paper we hypothesized that patients with \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nwould be expected to exhibit a similar age effect \nunless the chronically high airflow resistance in \npatients with COPD results in an adaptive respon-\nse leading to higher detection thresholds across \nthe older (above 55 years) age range and thereby \na loss of the progressive age-related rise seen in \nnormal subjects and well-controlled asthmatics \nwithin the 55 to 80+ age band. This might in turn \nlead to a generally blunted sense of raised airflow \nresistance, one consequence of which could be \na tendency to under-ventilate in response to ri-\nsing resistance and could arguably contribute to \ncarbon dioxide retention in some COPD patients \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 313–319\n314\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\n[3]. There is some empirical evidence for this \ncontention though almost all extant studies have \nbeen carried out in patients with COPD using \nsequential bronchoconstriction or under dynamic \nexternal airflow loading conditions [4–6]. During \ninduced bronchoconstriction airflow resistance \nrises in relatively large and unpredictable incre-\nments so it is difficult to determine accurately \nthe level of airways resistance at which a sensa-\ntion of impaired airflow is first felt subjectively. \nTherefore, studies of that type might not provide \nthe best insight into the influence of ageing and \nchronic airflow limitation on one of the most \nclinically relevant issues, namely whether the \neffect of age on airflow resistance sensing remains \na factor in COPD, or is exaggerated, or is over-rid-\nden by the neuro-physiological consequences of \npersistently high airflow resistance. Our method \nfor measuring LDT was developed to address the \nlimitations of the bronchoconstriction methods \n[1]. A full review of the mechanisms determining \nresistance sensing are outside the scope of this \npaper, though the background physiology and \nrelated hypotheses have been covered in depth \nin our previous publications [1, 2, 7]. In short, \ndetecting subjectively an increase in airflow \nresistance is the result of sensing that a change \nhas occurred in the relation between inspiratory \neffort and the resulting tidal volume, an example \nof length-tension sensing [8–10]. The dynamic \ncentral monitoring of such breath-by-breath lung \nvolume movements must depend on sensory in-\nformation arising in thoracic mechano-receptors, \nincluding those located in the diaphragm, chest \nwall, airways and lung parenchyma. The dete-\nrioration of proprioceptive acuity with age has \nbeen well documented for a number of functions \nsuch as postural sway, gaze stability and point \nrelocation [11–16]. If an analogous change occurs \nin the accuracy and central processing of afferent \nmechano-receptor traffic from the diaphragm and \nchest wall it can be hypothesized that the resting \nLDT would rise progressively with age in patients \nabove 55 years (the range within which most \ndiagnosed COPD patients reside) and become \nmore variable, as was observed in healthy people \nand asthmatics in remission [1, 2]. This was the \nprimary hypothesis to be tested by the study pre-\nsented in this paper. Therefore, we conducted an \nexperiment to explore LDT in patients with COPD \nin relation to age and a number of other variab-\nles of relevance in COPD including spirometric \nindices and smoking exposure.\nMaterial and methods\nStudy design and subject selection\nWe conducted a prospective open cross-sec-\ntional study. Patients with a diagnosis of COPD \nconfirmed by pulmonologists using nationally \nagreed criteria [17] were invited to consent to \nparticipate. Potential participants were selected \nfrom a departmental diagnostic list. A prelimi-\nnary powers calculation for comparing LDT be-\ntween groups, based on a pilot study, indicated \nthat from the 150 potential participants availa-\nble for the study, and assuming a population \nproportion of 50% and margin of error of 20%, \na sample of 30 would be the minimum for sho-\nwing significant difference with 95% confidence. \nThe selection was quasi-random as all patients \nwith COPD on the list were initially considered \nbefore application of the inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria and all those who accepted the invitation \nto participate entered the study. The inclusion \ncriteria were: adults with a diagnosis of COPD, \nat least 6 weeks since any exacerbation requiring \nan intervention and currently back to clinical \nbaseline, abbreviated mental test (AMT) [18] \nabove 7, willing to consent to take part in the \nstudy. The exclusion criteria were: contra-indi-\ncations to performing spirometry (such as recent \neye surgery), history of significant cognitive \nimpairment or overt dementia (unlikely to be \nable to perform the tests) [19], currently taking \nany medication that can alter respiratory sensory \nfunction or cause sedation (such as opioids or \nbenzodiazepines), any known or apparent cen-\ntral or peripheral nervous system condition that \nmight alter respiratory sensory function (such \nas stroke or sensory neuropathy), pulmonary \nco-morbidities that could alter the LDT (such \nas pulmonary fibrosis).\nWe also harvested LDT data from a study of \nnormal people [1] to provide a comparison group \nacross the same age range as the COPD study gro-\nup and with approximately the same distribution \nof ages over the range. This was done after the \nCOPD group had been recruited to enable the age \nrange to be comparable. The normal group were \nall lifelong non-smokers, or ex-trivial smokers \n(< 1 pack-year), and all had normal spirometry \nindices and no history of respiratory disease or \nany other condition or medication that might alter \ntheir LDT measurements. They were all either \nuniversity employees or staff and volunteers at \nour base hospital. \nStephen Charles Allen et al., Airflow resistance sensing in COPD\n315\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nMeasuring the LDT\nWe used exactly the same apparatus as in \nour previous studies of healthy people and asth-\nmatic patients [1, 2], constructed with standard \nrespiratory physiology equipment (Harvard Ap-\nparatus®). It was comprised of a flanged rubber \nmouthpiece connected to a unidirectional low \nresistance valve that was attached by a push-fit \nconnector to an airflow resistor by a 90 cm section \nof low resistance respiratory tubing. The resistor \ncould therefore be applied in either the inspira-\ntory or expiratory mode. A disposable microbio-\nlogical filter (Vitalograph®) was inserted between \nthe mouthpiece and valve. The dead space was \nless than 50 ml and did not vary. In preparatory \nexperiments [1] it was found that a resistor aper-\nture of lentiform cross-sectional shape provided \nthe most consistent and near-linear calibration \ncurve over the flow range anticipated during ti-\ndal breathing. Calibration of the resistor through \nits operational range was carried out with the \nresistor incorporated in the apparatus and using \npumped air at 5 litres per minute at room tem-\nperature (20–24 degrees centigrade) and ambient \nhumidity, with flow determined by a bobbin flow \nmeter (Rotameter®) and pressure by a water ma-\nnometer using standard laboratory methods. In \nour previously published studies on volunteers \nwilling to perform repeated LDT measurements \nwe found a mean coefficient of variation of 4.3% \nin people under 65 years of age and 6.2% in those \nover 64 years of age (5 subjects performed 20 con-\nsecutive inspiratory LDT measurements in each \ngroup). We also found no significant differences \nbetween the LDT values of men and women when \ncompared within young, middle aged and elderly \nage groups [1].\nA detailed description of the LDT measure-\nment procedure we developed has been published \nelsewhere [1, 2] and it is recommended that rese-\narchers wishing to construct a similar apparatus \nand to apply the technique should refer to those \npapers. In summary, LDT measurements were \nmade in a quiet room with sources of distraction \nminimised. The patient was seated and requested \nto breathe tidally through the LDT apparatus \nwearing a nose clip and a pulse oximetry finger \nprobe (Suaok® FS 10D). After a settling period \nof about 1 minute the resistor was closed, silen-\ntly and out of sight, in half millimetre long-axis \nincrements every 2 or 3 breath cycles until the \nsubject indicated by raising a hand that they had \nreached the point at which they could first feel \ndefinite resistance to breathing. The aperture \nsetting was recorded and later compared with the \ncalibration curve to determine the measurement. \nThree such measurements were made in each \nof the inspiratory and expiratory modes. The \nmeans of the 3 readings were taken as the recor-\nded inspiratory and expiratory LDTs (ILDT and \nELDT respectively). No readings were discarded. \nCorrections for actual temperature, humidity and \natmospheric pressure were not made on indivi-\ndual study days because they were found to be \ntoo small to be of significance.\nSpirometry\nSpirometry was performed on each parti-\ncipant using a desktop spirometer (NDD Easy-\nOn-PC\n®). The ERS/ATS performance and inter-\npretation standards [16] for forced spirometry \nwere applied and recordings were made of peak \nexpiratory flow rate (PEF), forced expiratory vo-\nlume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity \n(FVC). Subjects unable to have these indices me-\nasured to the required standard were not included \nin the data analysis. Height, weight, sex and age \nwere recorded and used to calculate predicted \nvalues electronically using regional tables for \nCaucasians.\nStudy sequence\nThe order of data collection for each subject \nwas: invitation and information, consent, AMT \nscore, Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale \n(MRCDS) [20](used with permission of the Medi-\ncal Research Council), record current medication, \nrecord clinical data (smoking history, sputum \nproduction and timing of last exacerbation), check \ninclusion and exclusion criteria, spirometry, LDT \nmeasurement. \nStatistical testing\nSome continuous data were found to be \napproximately normally distributed on visual \nassessment, though this was not clear in all ca-\nses and the Shapiro Wilk test rendered values of \n< 0.05 in every case. Because of the uncertain \ndistribution and small samples, groups were \ncompared by the Mann Whitney U test. To take \naccount of some outlying LDT data points in the \nrelatively small samples correlation coefficients \nwere calculated by the Spearman method, with \nthe Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. \nFor categorical data Fisher’s exact test was used \nto allow for the relatively small sample size. \nA significance level of 5% was adopted for group \ncomparisons and correlations. All calculations \nwere conducted using online software (socsci-\nstatistics.com). \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 313–319\n316\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nResults\nWe studied 31 COPD patients (25 men, all \nCaucasian) with a mean age of 72 years (median \n77, range 55–89). All were smokers or ex-smokers \nwith a mean exposure of 46 pack-years (range \n15–94). They were all clinically stable and at their \nusual baseline at the time of the study. Their re-\ngular medication consisted of combined long-ac-\nting anti-muscarinic agent (LAMA), long-acting \nbeta-adrenergic agonist (LABA) and corticosteroid \n(CS) by inhaler in 18 patients, LAMA plus LABA \nby inhaler in 3, CS plus either LAMA or LABA by \ninhaler in 6, LAMA alone by inhaler in 3 and no \nmedication in 1. The mean AMTS was 9.5 (range \n8–10), MRCDS was 2.7 (range 1–5), FEV1 46% \nof predicted (range 23–59) and FEV1/FVC ratio \n47.3% (range 25.5–68.3). It was confirmed that \nall met the spirometry criteria for COPD [17]. \nThe mean oxygen saturation at rest breathing air \nwas of 95% (range 88–97) and none had a fall in \noxygen saturation when having their LDTs me-\nasured. Their mean body mass index (BMI) was \n26 kg/m\n2 (range 18.5–37.8).\nThe mean (SD) ILDT and ELDT values were \n5.93 (7.02) kPa.s/L (range 1.5–36) and 5.19 (5.20) \nkPa.s/L (range 1–27) respectively, with no signi-\nficant difference. Though the between-subject \nrange was large there was close within-subject \nnumerical concordance when comparing both \nindices (Figure 1) with a high degree of correlation \n(r = 0.959, p < 0.001) and the line of regression \nthrough the points was close to the line of identity \nbetween the axes, indicating an absence of tidal \nphase bias. Correlations between ILDT, ELDT and \nother variables are shown in Table 1. There was \nno significant correlation between ILDT and age \n(Figure 2), FEV1, FVC, PEF, height, BMI, oxygen \nsaturation and smoking pack-years. However, the-\nre was significant correlation between ILDT and \nFEV1/FVC and between ELDT and FEV1/FVC. No \nsignificant correlations with ILDT or ELDT emer-\nged when FEV1, FVC and PEF were expressed as \npercentages of the predicted values derived from \nage, height, BMI and sex. The mean (SD) ILDT of \npatients who produced sputum on most days (N \n= 18) was 5.64 (5.14) kPa.s/L and that of those \nTable 1.\t Coefficients of correlation (r) and probability \nvalues (P) for ILDT and ELDT compared with \na number of variables.

There were no significant differences in the \nages or BMIs of the COPD and healthy groups  \n(P = 0.253 and P = 0.304 respectively), though \nthere was a significantly higher proportion of \nwomen in the healthy group (P = 0.05). The \nmean (SD) ILDT was 11.11 (8.47) kPa.s/L which \nwas significantly higher than in the COPD group \n(P = 0.005). In the healthy subjects a significant \npositive correlation was found between ILDT and \nage across the comparison age range (r = 0.589, \nP < 0.001)\nThe findings for ELDT were very similar for \nall comparisons. \nDiscussion\nThe findings of the study did not confirm the \nhypothesis we set out to test. On the contrary, we \nfound that the mean LDTs in patients with COPD \nwere lower rather than higher than those of the \nolder healthy comparison group within the same \nage range in this study and very similar to the \nyoung and middle-aged healthy subjects in our \nprevious study [1]. Further, there was no apparent \ntendency for LDTs to rise with age in the COPD \ngroup, unlike healthy control patients, across the \n55 to 85 age range. There must be some caution \nin drawing any firm conclusions from these data, \nparticularly the correlative relationships, because \nthe sample was relatively small and the levels of \nstatistical significance, or lack thereof, must be \ninterpreted in the light of that limitation. Never-\ntheless, in group comparisons the clearly signifi-\ncantly lower mean LDT values in COPD patients \ncompared to healthy people in the same age range \nis noteworthy. It appears that the physiological \nburden of chronically raised airways resistance \ndoes not have a blunting or down-regulatory ef-\nfect on the ability to detect subjectively a rise in \nairflow resistance in COPD. Indeed, there appears \nto be preservation of that ability across an older \nage range in COPD in contrast to healthy people \nand asthmatics in remission [1, 2]. The reasons \nfor this observation are not clear. It is known that \npeople with COPD breathe with an exaggerated \nintrathoracic pressure swing between inspiration \nand expiration and at a higher and less mecha-\nnically advantageous lung volume [21] so it can \nbe postulated that they could be predisposed to \nfiner detection of perturbations in length-tension \ncycles during tidal breathing and thereby con-\nserve LDT detection sensitivity into old age. If \nthat were a contributary mechanism it might be \nexpected that LDTs would rise in line with the \nFEV1/FVC ratio as those with higher ratios can \narguably be considered to have less impairment \nof respiratory mechanics. We found such a rise \nthat was of borderline statistical significance for \nILDT though more clearly significant for ELDT. \nThis supports the rationale described, though the \nnumber of participants was probably too low to \ncomment on that aspect with certainty. Further, \nthe unexpected negative correlation we found \nbetween LDTs and age might also be due to the \ndeterioration in lung and chest wall mechanics \nover time in people with COPD, which might \nconsequently eclipse the effects of ageing that \nwe found in healthy subjects in this study and \nin previous work [1, 2]. Again, the small sample \nsize, which was probably insufficiently powered \nfor that particular part of the analysis precludes \na firm conclusion. However, the trend makes phy-\nsiological sense and needs to the specific focus of \nanother study. The age and BMI characteristics \nof the groups were comparable so it is unlikely \nthat those variables could account for the diffe-\nrences we observed. There was a significantly \nlarger proportion of women in the healthy group. \nHowever, in our previous work [1, 2] we found \nno differences in the pattern of the relationship \nbetween ILDT and age between men and women, \nand that also appeared to be the case on scrutiny \nof the distribution of measurements in this study, \nthough the samples were too small for confident \nstatistical analysis. \nIn healthy people and patients with COPD the \ndetection thresholds were below the resistance \nlevels that we found to be distressing or uncom-\nfortable in young and middle-aged healthy sub-\njects who took part in our preliminary resistance \nranging studies [1]. However, it is not known \nwhether the afferent input from chest wall and \ndiaphragmatic mechano-receptors has a linear \ninfluence on central length-tension processing. \nIf not, it can be argued that the small additional \nresistances used when testing for LDT would \nhave a proportionally larger central effect for \nCOPD patients already tidally breathing at higher \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 313–319\n318\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nlung volumes against chronically raised airflow \nresistance and greater recoil forces, thus allowing \nan alternative explanation for our observations to \nbe posited. There is not complete agreement as to \nwhether external airflow resistance loading is a va-\nlid analogue for intrinsic airways resistance, though \nit has been acknowledged that mechano-receptors \nmust be involved [22]. The role of afferent sensory \ntraffic from airway and lung parenchymal receptors \n[23] does not appear to be dominant in normal \nsubjects, though could be more contributary to de-\ntermining the sensitivity of central length-tension \nprocessing in those with lung disease, including \nCOPD [24]. However, it has been observed that lung \ntransplant patients, who have denervated lungs \nbut intact chest wall and diaphragmatic sensation, \nretain the ability to judge lung volumes and have \nnormal sensitivity to changes in external airflow \nresistance [25–27], which reinforces the key role \nof the mechano-receptors in the skeleto-muscu-\nlar structures in airflow resistance sensing. The \nfindings of our previous studies of healthy people \nand well-controlled asthmatics suggested that an \nage-related reduction in the sensitivity of airflow re-\nsistance sensing could be at least partly responsible \nfor the clinically observed reduction in the ability of \nelderly people to detect early the changes in airflow \nresistance that occur, for example, in a worsening of \nasthma. However, the same does not seem to be the \ncase for patients with COPD who appear to retain \nan acuity of airflow resistance sensing that is more \ntypical of young adults. \nThere are clinical implications to the findings \nof this study. Our findings suggest that patients \nwith COPD who are not undergoing an exacerba-\ntion are likely to be able to detect a rise in their \nairway resistance with a high degree of acuity \nat any age. Therefore, the concern that elderly \nCOPD patients might delay taking reliever inhaled \nbroncho-dilator therapy, or present later to medi-\ncal services for help during an exacerbation due \nto ageing effects on resistance sensing is refuted, \nunlike some elderly asthmatics. It is apparently \ntherefore not necessary to advocate that the COPD \ntreatment guidelines [17] need take account of age \nfor that specific reason. Of course, elderly patients \nwith COPD do have a higher prevalence of other \nfactors that complicate their management, such \nas dementia and heart failure, which must be \nacknowledged in their treatment plans. \nConflict of interest\nNone of the authors has any conflict of inte-\nrest to declare.\nReferences:\n1.\t Allen SC, Vassallo M, Khattab A, et al.

There are no standard prognostic and dia-\ngnostic methods. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical and prognostic assessment of IL-4 and IL-13 concentrations \nin children with recurrent wheezing.\nMaterial and methods: The study included 96 children with recurrent wheezing. 81 patients were diagnosed as transient \nwheezing, 15 patients with asthma, and 25 healthy children were selected as controls. The concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13 were \nanalyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data analysis was performed \nusing Statsoft Statistica Version 8 (Tulsa, OK) and the statistical program MedCalc version 17.2.\nResults: Both IL-4 and IL-13 concentrations were significantly higher in DDA (21.13 pg/mL, 26.13 pg/mL, respectively) and \nTW (13.86 pg/mL, 18.3 pg/mL, respectively) groups as compared to healthy controls (3.37 pg/mL, 16.35 pg/mL, respectively; \np < 0.001), and the highest rates were observed in children with diagnosed asthma (p < 0.001, DDW vs TW, respectively). IL-4 \nconcentration higher than 18.45 pg/mL (with sensitivity 86.7% and specificity 80%) and IL-13 concentration higher than 20.17 pg/ \n/mL (with sensitivity 100% and specificity 76.7%) in EBC in children with wheezing recurrence can be considered as a possible \npredictor of asthma development.\nConclusions: The concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 were significantly increased in children with \nrecurrent wheezing and the highest rates were found in asthma developing children. The concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13 in chil-\ndren with wheezing can be considered as a possible predictor of asthma development.\nKey words: asthma, inflammation, IL-4, IL-13, children\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 320–326\nIntroduction \nAsthma is one of the most common chronic \ndiseases in children and young adults [1–5]. \nThe number of severe and uncontrolled forms of \nasthma has increased, leading to greater disability \nand mortality among patients [1–2]. The debut of \nthe disease takes place in childhood [3–5]. Accu-\nrate diagnosis of asthma in this age cohort may \nrepresent a significant clinical challenge [1, 3, 6]. \nFirstly, the clinical signs of wheezing in children \ncan be caused by many diseases, among which, \nbesides asthma, there are hereditary and birth \ndefects with metabolic processes, pathology of the \ngastroesophageal zone, congenital and acquired \ndefects of the heart and main vessels and many \nothers that should be included in the differential \ndiagnostics [3–5, 7]. Secondly, in children under \n6 years of age, there are limitations in the study of \nlung function. Therefore, in this cohort, diagnosis \nis based mainly on clinical and anamnestic data \n[6–8]. So, the global medical problem is to expand \nthe diagnostic possibilities of early detection of \nasthma in children. \nThe pathogenesis of the disease, namely \nchronic inflammation, is a systemic process, but \nit damages mainly the respiratory tract [8, 9]. At \nthe beginning of the formation of inflammation, \nthe mechanisms do not depend on the type of the \ndamage (allergic, infectious, etc.) and have gener-\nal signs of action of cytokine complexes [10–13]. \nSeveral proinflammatory (IL1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, \nNataliia Makieieva et al., Predictive of chronic inflammation in children with asthma\n321\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nGM-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, \nIL-10, IL-13, TGF-b) are synthesized [11–13]. It is \nknown that IL-4 function is to induce increased \nconcentration of IgE, and IL-13 is a unique, \nTh2-linked, cytokine that interacts with B cells \nand thus regulates inflammatory and immune \nresponses [14–16]. Recent studies have found \nan increase in serum concentration of these \nanti-inflammatory cytokines. They are not only \nable to induce the inflammatory process, but also \nsupport it, leading to a chronic activity. These \ninterleukins that characterize chronic inflamma-\ntion lead to airway remodeling and hyperplasia \nof the muscular system of the bronchopulmonary \nsystem [17]. Thus, it is advisable to study the \nconcentration of these indicators directly in the \ninflammation locus. \nThe study of mediators and markers of in-\nflammation released by damage of the respira-\ntory system is possible due to the procedure of \nbronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum [18]. \nHowever, because of the fact that these studies \nare related to invasive intervention, they cannot \nbe repeated in a short period of time, especially \nin pediatric patients. Considering non-invasive \nmethods that can be used in children, and to be \nable to reflect the state of local inflammation \nof the respiratory system, the exhaled breath \ncondensate (EBC) seems to be optimal option \n[18]. It is a promising source of biomarkers of \nlung disease. EBC represents a matrix in which \nbiomarkers can be identified [18, 19]. Till date \ninterleukins’ levels in EBC, especially in cohorts \nof young children have been rarely evaluated. In \nthis study, we conducted clinical and prognos-\ntic evaluation of interleukin 4 and interleukin \n13 concentration in EBC children with recurrent \nwheezing episodes. \nMaterial and methods \nStudy design \nThis was a longitudinal cohort study of \nchildren with recurrent wheezing from February \n2015 to November 2019 who were treated at \na children’s hospital. The study consisted of two \nstages. In the first phase (recruitment, February \n2015 — May 2015), among the 305 children who \nwere admitted to the hospital with wheezing, \n126 children between the ages of 1.5 and 6, who \nmet the inclusion criteria and did not fulfill \nexclusion criteria were included to the study. \nInclusion criteria: signing informed consent by \nthe patient’s parents; patient’s age from 1.5 to \n6 years; current wheezing episode at recruitment \nis third and more. Exclusion criteria: congenital \nand chronic cardiopulmonary or neurological \ndisease; hereditary diseases that lead to changes \nin the functioning of the respiratory tract, includ-\ning cystic fibrosis; proven immune deficiency; \nproven or suspected acute or chronic bacterial \ninfection, including infection of the oral cavity \nand respiratory tract; suspected or confirmed \ngastroesophageal diseases; previous treatment \nwith antileukotriene drugs or systemic corticoste-\nroids. The patients underwent specific treatment \naccording to accepted recommendations [20]. \nAll study subjects underwent clinical medical \nhistory review, physical examination and labo-\nratory assessment. Children were also examined \nfor IL-4 and IL-13 concentration in the exhaled \nbreath condensate. The study of anti-inflammato-\nry cytokines was conducted on the first day of the \ndisease in the presence of clinical manifestations \nof wheezing. \nThe control group comprised 25 healthy chil-\ndren (of similar age/gender) without any ­signs of \nchronic or acute diseases for the previous three \nmonths, presented to Hospital for routine health \ncontrol or vaccination. The parents of all patients \nand controls were informed about the study objec-\ntives and written informed consent was obtained \nbefore inclusion in the study. \nSecond stage (follow-up, May 2015—Sep-\ntember 2019). The patients were called for re- \n-examination at the age of 5–6 years. The inclu-\nsion and exclusion criteria in the study were \nre-evaluated. In the second stage, 96 children \nmet the inclusion criteria and did not satisfy \nexclusion criteria. Anamnestic data for this pe-\nriod were studied. An examination was carried \nout to verify the diagnosis of asthma at the time \nof re-examination. The diagnosis was based on \nthe GINA 2019 criteria and included symptoms \n(cough and wheezing) for more than 10 days \nduring the upper respiratory tract infection, \nmore than 3 episodes of wheezing per year, the \nchild coughed between episodes, and there were \npresent atopic dermatitis or food allergy history \nor family history of asthma [20]. An objective as-\nsessment of the severity of respiratory failure and \ndifferential diagnosis of obstructive and possible \nrestrictive respiratory disorders were performed. \nThe patients were divided into groups depend-\ning on the asthma diagnosed during this period \nor diagnosed during the visit. The first group \nincluded 81 transient wheezing (TW) children \nwho stopped wheezing symptom at follow-up. \nThe second group included 15 patients with \ndoctor-diagnosed asthma (DDA). \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 320–326\n322\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nExhaled breath condensate: \ntechnical and diagnostic aspects \nThe device for EBC receiving was designed \nusing a portable glass tube in accordance with \nmaterial collection standards. The glass tube was \ncooled, surrounded by a mixture of refrigerants \nto obtain a temperature that reached from -5°C to \n-10°C. There, exhaled air in the form of droplets \nwas converted to EBC [18, 21]. After collection, \nthe glass tube was detached, and the sample was \nstored immediately at -70° C. The device has \na manual control of condensing temperature and \ncleaning requirements of the tool between conse-\nquent trials. All collections were done between \n8:30 and 09:30 a.m. The subjects wore a nose \nclip, which prevented contamination of the ma-\nterial with excretions from the nasal mucosa, and \nprevented the possibility of inhaling or exhaling \nthrough the nasal cavity. For children over three \nyears of age, condensate was collected through \nsystems with a single-use mouthpiece that was \nconnected to a one-way exhalation valve to pre-\nvent the effects of inhaling the condensate. For \nsubjects younger than two years, an exhalation \nvalve with an inhalation mask was used. \nMeasurement of IL-4 and IL-13 \nin exhaled breath condensate\nIL-4 in EBC were analyzed by the ELISA \ntechnique using commercial kits (Human IL-4, \n“Vector Best Ukraine”, catalog number: A-8754), \nand IL-13 concentration were analyzed by the \nELISA technique using commercial kits (Human \nIL-13, eBioscience (Bender MedSystems), catalog \nnumber: BMS231-3, USA) according to the man-\nufacturer’s instructions. \nStatistical analysis \nAll statistical analyses were performed using \nStatSoft STATISTICA Version 8 package program \n(Tulsa, OK) and MedCalc statistical Software Ver-\nsion 17.2. Shapiro-Wilk’s test was used, and his-\ntogram and q-q plots were examined to assess the \nnormality. As the sample distribution was different \nfrom the normal, the median (Me) and the inter-\nquartile range were determined (Lq - lower quartile; \nUq - upper quartile). Fisher’s exact test, χ2 was used \nto calculate two relative indicators. Nonparametric \nMann-Whitney test (MW) was applied to compare \nthe two samples and Wilcoxon (T) nonparamet-\nric test was used to compare the two dependent \nsamples. The difference between the two param-\neters was considered statistically significant at \np < 0.05. The correlation between parameters was \ndetermined using the Spearman rank correlation \nanalysis (r); p < 0.05 was considered to indicate \na statistically significant difference. Receiver oper-\nating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for \nvariables to determine the optimal «cut-off» values \nto predict an endpoint. The endpoint of this study is \nthe formation of chronic inflammation in children \nwith recurrent wheezing. The cut-off point of each \nvariable and sensitivity, specificity, positive likeli-\nhood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (LR) of \nthis ”cut-off” point was obtained using the Youden \nindex. To determine the most reliable screening tool \namong these four variables, pairwise comparison \nof these variables was performed by determining \nthe differences between area under the curve using \nthe Hanley and McNeil method.\nEthics approval and consent to participation \nThe planned clinical studies were carried out \nafter receiving approval by the local ethics com-\nmittee (date: February 1, 2015; number: 2015/01) \nand were conducted in accordance with the \nprinciples of the Helsinki Declaration, amended \nin October 2013. \nResults\nGeneral information\nOf the 96 children with recurrent wheezing \nenrolled to the study, the majority were diagnosed \nwith transient wheezing (TW) (as they stopped \nwheezing at follow-up), and a minority devel-\noped asthma (DDA). These groups accounted for \n84.38% and 15.62%, respectively. No significant \ndifference was found when comparing age and \ngender groups. Anamnestic factors such as preg-\nnancy, cesarean delivery, and frequent manifes-\ntations of viral infections of the upper respiratory \ntract, presence of pets, passive smoking were not \nstatistically different between those groups. In \nregard of allergic history, atopic dermatitis, food \nallergy, allergic rhinitis, the presence of allergic \ndiseases and asthma in relatives, wheezing in the \nfirst year of life were likely to be more frequent in \npatients with DDA. Elevated eosinophil level and \nhigh IgE level were also significantly increased \nin patients with DDA (Table 1). \nIL-4 and IL-13 concentration\nIL-4 concentrations were significantly higher \nin DDA (21.13 pg/mL) and TW (13.86 pg/mL) ­groups \nNataliia Makieieva et al., Predictive of chronic inflammation in children with asthma\n323\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nas compared to healthy controls (3.37 pg/mL; \np < 0.001), and the highest rates were observed \nin children with diagnosed asthma (p < 0.001, \nDDW vs TW, respectively) (Table 2). Similarly, \nIL-13 concentrations were significantly higher in \nDDA (26.13 pg/mL) and TW (18.3 pg/mL) groups \nas compared to healthy controls (16.35 pg/mL; \np < 0.001), and the highest rates were observed \nin children with diagnosed asthma (p < 0.001, \nDDW vs TW, respectively).\nCorrelation between IL-4 and IL-13 parameters \nThe correlation between IL-4 and IL-13 con-\ncentration of all children with recurrent wheezing \nwas found (r = +0.37, p < 0.001). The relation-\nship between those biomarkers in children with \nDDA was r = +0.74, p < 0.001, and in TW cohort \nr = +0.17, p < 0.001. \nPrognostic criteria for IL-4 and IL-13 \nTo determine the prognostic significance of \nthe concentration of IL-4 and IL-13, ROC curve \nanalysis was performed. The relationship be-\ntween cytokine level during the first episodes of \nwheezing and the development of asthma was \ndetermined. The cut-off value for the concentra-\ntion of IL-4 higher than 18.45 pg/mL resulted in \nspecificity of 80% and sensitivity of 86.7%, and \nfor IL-13, concentration higher than 20.17 pg/mL \nresulted in specificity of 76.7% and sensitivity \nof 100% for the predefined endpoint, namely the \nformation of chronic asthma (Figure 1). \nDiscussion \nThis study found that among children with \nrecurrent wheezing, a greater proportion of pa-\ntients had transient wheezing and only 15.62% \ndeveloped asthma during follow-up. There are \nmany studies that describe the possible contrib-\nuting factors in children with recurrent wheezing \nfor formation of asthma. Several phenotypes are \nconsidered as the debut of the disease. The pro-\nportion of such children ranges from 13% to 16% \naccording to various sources [6, 22–24]. This fact \nhas been confirmed in our study. \nIn our study, an increased concentration of \nIL-4 in the exhaled breath condensate of children \nwith recurrent wheezing in the onset of clinical \nmanifestations was determined. The highest rates \nwere found in children who developed asthma \nduring the follow-up. IL-4 is known to stimulate \nIgE production, promote eosinophil accumulation \nin peripheral blood and tissues [14-17, 25–26]. \nTable 1.

An increased concentra-\ntion of this cytokine has been shown to indicate \nthe presence of allergic inflammation in pa-\ntients. There are studies demonstrating changes \nin serum IL-4 concentration in atopic dermatitis \nin children [25], adults, and adolescents with \nasthma [14, 17]. Recent researches have proved \nthat IL-4 concentration increase in the EBC of \nadult asthma patients, and IL-4 is considered as \na marker of chronic allergic inflammation [26]. \nIn our study, children up to 6 years of age were \nexamined, but IL-4 was also elevated, which was \nlikely to indicate an allergic nature of inflamma-\ntion of the bronchopulmonary system. An in-\ncreased IL-4 concentration in the exhaled breath \ncondensate can be considered as a manifestation \nof an active inflammatory process, directly in the \ninflammation locus. \nWe found that in children with recurrent \nwheezing, in the onset of clinical manifestations, \nIL-13 concentration in exhaled breath condensate \nwas also increased as compared to healthy con-\ntrols. The highest levels were found in children \nwho developed asthma. IL-13 is a Th2-linked cy-\ntokine and regulates the body’s inflammatory and \nimmune responses. It stimulates the production \nFigure 1. ROC curves for IL-4 and IL-13 as a biomarker of asthma development in children with wheezing episode\nTable 2.

Recent studies \nhave reported an increased IL-13 concentration \nin serum in atopic diseases in children [17, 25]. \nThere are data that confirmed an elevated IL-\n13 concentration in the serum in adolescents \nand adults asthma [14, 17]. These studies suggest \nthat changes in the concentration of this cytokine \nindicate the presence of allergic inflammation. We \nhave also regarded it as a manifestation of allergic \ninflammation, as well as activity of the process \nin the respiratory system, taking into account the \ndetection of indicators in the locus of damage. \nOur study evaluated the relationship between \nIL-4 and IL-13 in EBC children less than 6 years \nof age and established direct correlation between \nindicators. Similarly, significant correlation was \nfound in children who developed asthma. The \ncorrelations of IL-13 and IL-4 were made taking \ninto account the presence of similar pathways that \nare involved in the synthesis of IgE, activation \nof eosinophils, mucus secretion [14-16]. Recent \nstudies have demonstrated these relationships \nin adult patients with allergic airway disease \n[17, 25], where IL-4 has been identified as the \nfirst cytokine to be produced by mast cells and \nresponsible for promoting the production of IL-\n13 of mast cells [15]. Our study confirms the rela-\ntionship between these cytokines in the presence \nof allergic inflammation in children. \nThe ROC analysis determined the predictive \nconcentrations of IL-4 and IL-13 for development \nof asthma in children with wheezes. The criterion \nof IL-4 > 18.45 pg/mL and IL-13 > 20.17 pg/mL \nwere found to have prognostic significance, with \nhigh specificity and sensitivity rates in asthma \nformation in children with recurrent wheezing. \nNon-invasive techniques are used to investi-\ngate the health status of adults and children. There \nare several non-invasive techniques for the deter-\nmination of respiratory gases in exhaled air and \ncompounds dissolved in exhaled lung secretion. \nThere are studies using Electronic Noses (E-noses) \nthat can play a potential role in the screening and \nanalysis of various respiratory and systemic dis-\neases [27–29]. The EBC was chosen for our study.\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, \nabout 45% of children were with comorbid diseas-\nes, such as atopic dermatitis or food allergy, which \nmay result in higher concentration of IL-4 and \nIL-13 both in serum and EBC. Thus, the concen-\ntration of these cytokines obtained in children \nwith asthma could have higher rates due to con-\ncomitant allergic diseases [14, 25]. However, there \nis no evidence-based data that concentration of \nIL-4 or IL-13 can increase in EBC in children with \ncomorbid allergic diseases. Substances in the EBC \nare in large dilution, as the excretory fluid covers \nboth the alveolar epithelial layer and the mucous \nlayer of the respiratory tract. There is no existing \nmodel that allows collecting all the exhalation, \nsince the loss of moisture depends on the humidity \nand temperature of the environment. These factors \nare likely to have an influence on the obtained \nresults [18–19, 21, 26]. Another limitation of the \nstudy is that asthma is a heterogeneous disease \nand has many phenotypes [9, 22, 30–31]. There are \ntypes that have neutrophil and paucigranulocytic \nphenotype in their mechanism of development. \nThe most common is the eosinophilic type of \ninflammation, which is associated with eosino-\nphilic cellular infiltration and thickening of the \nbasement membrane area. The performed studies \nand the selected cytokines reflect just this type of \ninflammation. This study was conducted taking \ninto account only the eosinophilic phenotype, \nwhich is the most frequent in children.\nIn conclusion, among patients presenting \nwith recurrent wheezing, approximately in every \nsixth child, the disease has been transformed \ninto asthma. The concentrations of the IL-4 and \nIL-13 in exhaled breath condensate were signifi-\ncantly increased in children with manifestation \nof wheezing, and the highest rates were found in \nasthma developing children. Both cytokines are \ninvolved in the regulation of allergic inflamma-\ntory processes in the body, and have an influence \non the respiratory tract, as it was detected basing \non IL-4 and IL-13 concentration in the exhaled \nbreath condensate. IL-4 concentration higher than \n18.45 pg/mL and IL-13 concentration higher than \n20.17 pg/mL in exhaled breath condensate in chil-\ndren with wheezing recurrence can be considered \nas a possible predictor of asthma development.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences:\n1.\t Guo J, Zhu W, Wang H, et al.

A multi-hospital based study\nAbstract\nIntroduction: Physiological changes in pregnancy increase the vulnerability of antenatal women to develop obstructive sleep \napnoea (OSA). It is a known cause of several adverse health outcomes in pregnancy.\nObjectives: To assess the risk status of OSA in pregnant women and to study its association with adverse maternal outcomes, \nfatigability, and daytime sleepiness.\nMaterial and methods: Pregnant women were interviewed to assess for the risk of OSA, fatigability, and daytime sleepiness. \nSTOP BANG, the fatigue severity scale, and the Epworth sleepiness scale were used to assess these parameters. \nResults: The mean age of the 214 participants was 27.2 ± 4.7 years. 7 (3.3%) participants had a history of snoring louder than \nthe volume of normal talking, or of being loud enough to be heard past closed doors. A moderate risk status of OSA was present \namong 3 (1.4%) participants. 45 (21.0%) pregnancies were high risk in nature. The risk status of OSA was associated with a high \nrisk status of pregnancies among the participants (p = 0.0088). 41 (19.2%) participants had a history of significant fatigue over \nthe previous week of the study. 7 (3.3%) participants reported mild to severe excessive daytime sleepiness. A history of snoring \nloudly (p = 0.0179) and OSA risk status (p = 0.0027) was associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.\nConclusions: A risk status for OSA was associated with a high risk pregnancy status and excessive daytime sleepiness among \npregnant women in the current setting. Therefore, pregnant women with these conditions need to be evaluated for OSA. They \nalso need to be suitably managed to ensure the healthy well-being of the mother and the baby. \nKey words: pregnant women, obstructive sleep apnea, fatigue, daytime sleepiness \nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 327–334\nIntroduction\nPregnancy is a state associated with a num­\nber of physiological changes in the body. High \nlevels of progesterone and estrogen during preg­\nnancy cause fluid retention leading to swelling \naround the neck, mucus membranes, and nasal \npassages. These changes result in narrowing of \nthe oropharyngeal diameter and increased upper \nairway resistance leading to the occurrence of \nsnoring [1]. As many as 25% of pregnant women \nhave been found to be first time snorers during \nthe gestational period [1]. Heavy snoring accom­\npanied by pauses in breathing lead to a state \nof obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [1]. The state \nof reduced oxygenation during each episode of \nOSA can end with disastrous consequences both \nin the antenatal and in the intranatal period [2]. \nPrior studies have observed OSA complicating \npregnancy and resulting in an increased risk of \nintensive care admission\n as well as an\n increased \nduration of time spent in the hospital [3].\nAlthough OSA is a common complication in \npregnancy, it unfortunately remains underdiag­\nnosed due to reasons such as variable clinical pre­\nsentations\n [4] and poor validity of certain question­\nnaire-based tools [5]. Overnight polysomnogram, \nwhich is the gold standard for its diagnosis, is an \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 327–334\n328\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nexpensive, time-consuming, and uncomfortable \nprocedure which is not practical for application [6].\nSurveys have reported that 90% of pregnant \npatients with OSA were unaware of OSA and its \nconsequences [7].\n Doctors may also misinterpret \nthe excessive daytime sleepiness complaints \namong antenatal women as a normal symptom of \npregnancy. This results in a further delay in its \nidentification and management [8].\nThis study was therefore done to study the \nrisk status of OSA among pregnant women at \nvarious tertiary care centres in an urban setting. \nIts association with adverse maternal outcomes, \nfatigability, and daytime sleepiness were also \nevaluated in this study. \nMaterial and methods\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted \namong pregnant women, both admitted and \nthose seeking outpatient services, at a private \nand a government tertiary care hospital in Man­\ngalore, India. Ethical clearance was approved by \nthe Institutional Ethics Committee. The reference \nnumber was IECKMCMLR/023/2019. Permission \nwas granted by the medical superintendent of the \nrespective hospitals. The study was conducted in \nthe month of February 2019. \nConsent was given in writing after clarifying \nthe procedure and purpose of the study to each \nparticipant.\nAssuming that 31.9%\n [9] of pregnant women are \nat a greater risk for developing OSA, the sample size \nwas calculated as 214 at 95% confidence intervals \nand 80% power using the formula n = 4pq/d\n2.\nAll participants were examined only once as \na part of this study. They were enrolled using the \nconvenience sampling method. Participants aged \n18 years and above were included whereas those \nwho refused to give consent for participation were \nexcluded from this study. They were then inter­\nviewed using a structured interview schedule. \nThe risk status for developing OSA was assessed \nusing the STOP BANG questionnaire. It has eight \nitems with responses for each in a “yes” and “no” \nformat. The participant was categorized as having \neither a low, moderate, or high risk of OSA if they \nanswered “yes” to < 3, 3–4, ≥ 5 items respectively. \nThis tool has been validated to identify OSA in \npregnancy and has been found to have the highest \nspecificity among the various questionnaire-based \nOSA screening tools [10].\nThe current level of fatigue among participants \nwas assessed using the fatigue severity scale (FSS) \nwhich consists of nine items.\n The responses to \neach item were “strongly disagree”, “moderately \ndisagree”, “slightly disagree”, “neutral”, “slightly \nagree”, “moderately agree”, and “strongly agree” in \na Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 to 7 respec­\ntively. A cumulative score of ≥ 36 was indicative of \na significant level of fatigue among the participants.\nDesire to sleep while engaging in different \nactivities during the daytime in recent times \nwas assessed using the Epworth sleepiness scale \n(ESS). The responses to the eight items in this \nscale were “would never nap”, “slight chance \nof napping”, “moderate chance of napping” and \n“high chance of napping”, scored from 0 to 3 re­\nspectively. An ESS score over 10 was indicative \nof excess daytime sleepiness. \nThe internal consistency of the STOP BANG \nquestionnaire, FSS and ESS used in this study had \nthe Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.724, 0.878 and \n0.693 respectively, indicating good reliability.\nDemographic details (age, occupation, educa­\ntion, and place of residence), obstetric details (ob­\nstetric score and gestational age), and the presence \nof risk factors (co-morbidities, history of tobacco \nusage, long standing medication history, family \nhistory of snoring, and known status of OSA) were \nenquired about among the respondents.\nIn addition, height, weight, neck circumfer­\nence, and blood pressure were measured among \nall participants using instruments like stadi­\nometers, measuring tapes, weighing scales and \nmercury sphygmomanometers as per standard \nguidelines. \nPre-pregnancy weight, recent haemoglobin \nvalues, and recent fasting blood sugar (FBS) val­\nues were noted from the antenatal records of the \nparticipants. BMI status was assessed using the \nAsian classification. Participants with haemoglo­\nbin values < 11 g/dL were categorized as anaemic \nand those with FBS ≥ 95 mg/dL of blood were in­\nterpreted as having increased blood sugar levels.\nThe interview schedule was content validat­\ned and was also language validated in the local \nlanguage “Kannada” with the help of experts. The \nschedule was then pilot tested among 10 antena­\ntal women who were not part of the main study.\nIBM SPSS for Windows version 25.0, Ar­\nmonk, New York was used for data entry and \nanalysis.

Lower normal daytime \nsleepiness was present among 177 (82.7%), higher \nnormal daytime sleepiness among 30 (14%), mild \nexcessive daytime sleepiness among 3 (1.4%), \nmoderate excessive daytime sleepiness among \n3 (1.4%), and severe excessive daytime sleepiness \nin 1 (0.5%) participant in recent times. \nA history of snoring loudly (p = 0.0179) and \nOSA risk status (p = 0.0027) was associated with \nexcessive daytime sleepiness (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nEarly identification of OSA among pregnant \nwomen is essential for both maternal and fetal \nwell-being. \nA history of snoring loudly was present \namong 3.3% participants which was less than the \nfindings of previous studies [21.2% and 35.3%\n \n(11, 12)]. The tendency to snore occurs as a re­\nsult of the normal physiological changes during \npregnancy which lead to narrowing of upper air­\nways. A history of snoring and frequent snoring \n(≥ 3 nights/week) among pregnant women have \nalso been linked to the surge of estrogen and pro­\ngesterone levels during the antenatal period [13].\nIn the current study, 1.4% of the participants \nwere found to have a greater risk for develop­\ning OSA which was again less than 13.4%\n [14], \n18.4% [15], 26.4%\n [9], 26.7%\n [16] and 30.9%\n [17] \nreported in previous studies. The trimester wide \ndistribution of greater risk status for OSA was \nnone in the first, 1.8% in the second, and 1.4% \nin the third trimester among participants in this \nstudy. In previous studies, the risk of OSA in the \nfirst trimester was reported as 10.5% [18], 10.7% \n[2], and 30.4%\n [9]; in the second trimester 29%\n \n[19] and 33.3%\n [9]; in the third trimester 24.1%\n \n[2], 26.7%\n [18], 32%\n [9], and 34.7%\n [20] of all \nparticipants. The risk of OSA was therefore low \nin particular trimesters of pregnancy in this study \ncompared to the results of other authors. \nHowever, it is notable that the risk of devel­\noping OSA was observed to increase in the sec­\nond and third trimesters as compared to the first \ntrimester of pregnancy in this study. This can be \nexplained due to the fact that the enlarging uterus \nelevates the diaphragm and alters respiration. \nThese alterations during sleep increase the risk \nof upper airway collapse, and for OSA, as the \npregnancy progresses. An increase in the levels \nof estrogen and progesterone as the pregnancy \nadvances is also responsible. An increase in estro­\ngen concentration increases mucosal edema and \nprogesterone increases the respiratory centre’s \nsensitivity to carbon dioxide and destabilizes the \nrespiratory control mechanism [21]. Therefore, it \nis important to screen for OSA and monitor for \nits development during every trimester as the \npregnancy advances. It has been recommended \nto screen for OSA between 12 and 18 weeks to \nallow adequate time for its evaluation and early \nmanagement [22].\nIn a study done in Peru, overweight and obese \npregnant women were more likely to report a his­\ntory of snoring [23]. Snoring has been found to \nbe a risk factor for PIH, pre-eclampsia\n and GDM\n \n[24]. However, these were different from our ob­\nservations because no such association was seen. \nNo specific risk factors were associated with \nOSA risk status in this study. This was again differ­\nent from findings of previous studies where age [2, \n14, 18], tongue enlargement\n [2], pre-pregnancy BMI\n \n[9], first trimester BMI\n [18], current BMI [2, 9, 14, \n13] and weight gain during pregnancy\n [9]\n were re­\nported as potential risk factors for developing OSA.\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 327–334\n332\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nTable 4. \t Association between a history of snoring loudly and OSA risk status with a high risk status of pregnancy, fati­\ngue, and excessive daytime sleepiness among participants\nFatigue status\nHistory of snoring loudly\nPresent\nAbsent\nTotal\nPresent\n2 (28.6)\n5 (71.4)\n7\nAbsent \n39 (18.8)\n168 (81.2)\n207\np = 0.621\nTotal\n41\n173\n214\nDaytime sleepiness status\nHistory of snoring loudly\nExcessive\nNormal\nTotal\nPresent\n2 (28.6)\n5 (71.4)\n7\nAbsent \n5 (2.4)\n202 (97.6)\n207\np = 0.0179\nTotal\n7\n207\n214\nType of pregnancy\nHistory of snoring loudly\nHigh risk\nNormal\nPresent\n3 (42.9)\n4 (57.1)\n7\nAbsent \n42 (20.3)\n165 (79.7)\n207\np = 0.163\nTotal \n45\n169\n214\nPIH/Pre-Eclampsia status\nHistory of snoring loudly\nPresent\nAbsent\nPresent\n1 (14.3)\n6 (85.7)\n7\nAbsent \n17 (8.2)\n190 (91.8)\n207\np = 0.464\nTotal \n18\n196\n214\nFatigue status\nOSA risk status\nPresent\nAbsent\nTotal\nModerate risk\n2 (66.7)\n1 (33.3)\n3\nLow risk\n39 (18.5)\n172 (81.5)\n211\np = 0.095\nTotal\n41\n173\n214\nDaytime sleepiness status\nOSA risk status\nExcessive\nNormal\nTotal\nModerate risk\n2 (66.7)\n1 (33.3)\n3\nLow risk\n5 (2.4)\n206 (97.6)\n211\np = 0.0027\nTotal\n7\n207\n214\nType of pregnancy\nOSA risk status\nHigh risk\nNormal\nModerate risk\n3 (100)\n0 (0)\n3\nLow risk\n42 (19.9)\n169 (80.1)\n211\np = 0.0088\nTotal\n45\n169\n214\nPIH/Pre-Eclampsia status\nOSA risk status\nPresent\nAbsent\nModerate risk\n1 (33.3)\n2 (66.7)\n3\nLow risk\n17 (8.1)\n194 (91.9)\n211\np = 0.233\nTotal\n18\n196\n214\nGDM status\nOSA risk status\nPresent\nAbsent\nModerate risk\n1 (33.3)\n2 (66.7)\n3\nLow risk\n6 (2.8)\n205 (97.2)\n211\np = 0.0954\nTotal\n7\n207\n214\nGDM — gestational diabetes mellitus; OSA — obstructive sleep apnoea; PIH — pregnancy-induced hypertension\nNitin Joseph et al., Assessment of obstructive sleep apnoea among pregnant women\n333\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nAlthough OSA risk status was associated \nwith a high risk status of pregnancy, it was not \nspecifically associated with either hypertensive \ndisorders or GDM among participants in this \nstudy. In other studies, OSA in pregnancy was \nassociated with PIH [14, 24], preeclampsia [15, \n24] and GDM [14, 24]. Various hypertensive dis­\norders in pregnancy have been suggested to result \nfrom endothelial dysfunction as a consequence \nof OSA related intermittent hypoxemia [25]. Fre­\nquent arousals from sleep among OSA patients \nlead to a decrease in slow wave sleep. This causes \nsympathetic activation which disrupts the hy­\npothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Altered sleep \nalso causes an alteration in cortisol synthesis \nand release. These mechanism induce insulin \nresistance and alter glucose homeostasis [26, 27]. \nPeriodic hypoxia in OSA affects beta cell activity \nof the pancreas [28]. \nPregnant women are therefore advised to \nsleep in a lateral position which keeps airways \nopen and thereby minimizes the risk of hypoxia \ninduced by OSA [25].\n On top of this, continuous \nairway positive pressure (CPAP), if initiated \nearly in pregnancy even in those with history \nof chronic snoring, would be beneficial in blood \npressure control [4]. Tolerance to nasal CPAP has \nbeen found to be good during pregnancy without \nreports of any adverse effects [29]. \nThere was no association between OSA risk \nstatus and fatigability among pregnant women \nin this study. \nHowever, the present study found that a his­\ntory of snoring loudly and OSA risk status were \nassociated with excessive daytime sleepiness \namong pregnant women. This was in contrast to \nthe findings of previous studies done in the USA \n[18] and in Thailand\n [9] where no such association \nwas reported. Medical practitioners and patients \nthemselves end up mistaking excessive daytime \nsleepiness as usual symptoms in pregnancy. This \nmay further delay the diagnosis and management \nof OSA which needs to be taken care of [8].\n Health \ncare providers need to further take up the respon­\nsibility of bringing up the awareness about OSA \nand its consequences among pregnant women. \nThis is important as pregnancy may be the only \noccasion during which the woman might seek \nmedical attention. \nConclusions\nOSA risk status was associated with a high risk \npregnancy status and excessive daytime sleepiness \namong pregnant women in the current setting. \nTherefore, pregnant women with these conditions \nneed to be evaluated for OSA. They also need to be \nsuitably managed to ensure the healthy well-being \nof both the mother and the baby.\nLimitations\nUnder reporting of information may be pos­\nsible among participants with respect to snoring \nand other variables such as fatigability and day­\ntime sleepiness. The cross-sectional design of \nthis study is limited with regards to its ability \nto interpret temporality of the association. This \ncould have been rectified had the same pregnant \nwomen been longitudinally followed up during \nthe gestational period.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences:\n1.\t Hines J.

The new \npathogen was named severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the \ndisease in which it is an etiological factor for was \nnamed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. \nSince then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading to \nother cities and countries becoming the global \nemerging epidemiological issue and quickly \nreaching the status of a pandemic. On the 4\nth \nof March, the first SARS-CoV-2 positive patient \nwas officially confirmed by the Polish Ministry of \nHealth [2]. Since that time, morbidity and mor­\ntality have been increasing across the country. \nThe key to effective treatment of these pa­\ntients is to increase knowledge about the patho­\nbiology of the disease which does not seem to be \nfully understood so far. \nMultiple risk factors of disease severity and \nmortality have been identified so far. These in­\nclude old age, male sex, smoking, and obesity \n[3–8]. Therefore, in our considerations, we decid­\ned to cover these issues in the broad and multi­\nfaceted context of interactions, mainly focusing \non its interference with the immunopathological \nbackground of COVID-19. We attempted to sum­\nmarize the current state of knowledge and draw \nsome hypotheses for further research in order \nto raise questions and open up a debate about \nanalyzed issues. Figure 1 summarizes the main \npoints discussed in the manuscript.\nBeyond age…\nAgeing may be defined as a progressive de­\ncline in tissue homeostasis due, at least in part, \nto the accumulation of replicative, oxidative, and \ngenotoxic stress over time [9]. An increasing body \nof evidence suggests that ageing is associated \nwith chronic inflammation, both pathological \nand physiological. \nMultiple causes may contribute to ageing-\n-associated inflammation such as pro-inflam­\nmatory tissue damage, a dysfunctional immune \nsystem, proinflammatory cytokines secreted \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 335–342\n336\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nby senescent cells, enhanced Nuclear Factor \nkappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells \n(NF-κB) activation, and a defective autophagy \nresponse. These factors enhance the activation of \ninflammatory pathways (i.e. the nod-like recep­\ntor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome) and then induce \nthe production of cytokines such as interleukin \n(IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and \ninterferons (IFNs). Long term inflammation could \nbe a major cause of ageing-associated diseases \n[10]. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection, viroporin \n3a has also been shown to trigger the activa­\ntion of the inflammasome NOD 3-like receptor \nprotein (NLRP3) and the secretion of IL-1β in \nbone marrow macrophages. This condition may \nresult in an increased release of a large number \nof pro-inflammatory agents. Reports suggest that \na storm of cytokines is released in patients with \nSARS-CoV-2 disease which is mainly manifested \nby increased IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony stimu­\nlating factor (GC-SF), monocyte chemo-attracting \nprotein 1 (MCP1), and TNF-α. Of all the interleu­\nkins, IL-6 has been found to be associated with \nhighly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 infection due to \nFigure 1. Graphical summary of the manuscript (author: AJ Białas)\nAdam J Białas et al., Ageing, sex, smoking and COVID-19\n337\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nincreased viral replication mainly in the lower \nrespiratory tract [11, 12].\nTelomere-controlled cellular ageing\nThe inflammatory process associated with \ntelomere-controlled cellular ageing can lead to \nreduced tissue regenerative capacity. This is prob­\nably due to the impairment of stem and progenitor \ncell functions. \nA telomere is a region of tandem repeats of \nshort DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes \nwhich are important for their stability and allow \nfor the complete replication of the ends [13, 14]. \nThe telomere proteome consists of more than \n200 proteins that are associated with different \naspects of telomere functioning including their \nprotection, elongation, or telomeric DNA synthesis \n[13–16]. Telomere length homeostasis is essential \nfor the proper functioning of the cell [14, 17]. Telo­\nmeres are also an important element in the ageing \nof cells. As well, they are involved in maintaining \nimmune homeostasis. They are also the main indi­\ncator of biological age and are a measurable marker \nof both inflammation and oxidative stress [10].\nNormal ageing is, by itself, associated with \ntelomere shortening. A significant shortening of \ntelomeres leads to cell death. The speed of short­\nening can be further increased by inflammation \nand oxidative stress and thus, affects the ageing \nprocess. In addition, cell telomere shortening \nmay be associated with an increase in NF-κB \ntranscription factor activity and overexpression \nof inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, \nand IFN-γ in circulating macrophages [10, 18]. \nNF-κB is a family of seven transcription factors \n(p50, p52, p100, p105, RelA/p65, RelB, and C-Rel) \nand plays a central role in inflammation and cell \nresponse by controlling gene network expression \n[19, 20]. Activation of NF-κB is redox-sensitive \nand can be regulated by the changes in the ox­\nidant/antioxidant balance [19]. The members \nof this family may activate expression of many \npro-inflammatory genes which also play a role in \nlung inflammation [19, 21]. This evidence justifies \nthe reports about upregulation of NF-κB activity in \nboth naturally aged mice and multiple progeroid \nmouse models of accelerated ageing [9].\nThe generation gap?\nThe specific vulnerability of older people to \nsevere COVID-19 disease is well documented. \nHowever, let us discuss why children seem to be \nmore protected.\nScarpa et al. suggest that the essential role of \nthe thymus could be crucial in the modulation of \nthe immune response toward SARS-CoV-2 lead­\ning to a less severe phenotype in children when \ncompared with adult COVID-19 patients. They \nidentify inflammaging associated with the absence \nof thymopoietic mechanisms as a potentially \npredisposing condition that sustains the surge \nof proinflammatory cytokines that is specifically \nreported in older COVID-19 patients [22]. Indeed, \nsevere adult COVID-19 pneumonia cases are as­\nsociated with a decrease in regulatory T cells and \nCD4+/CD8+ T cells [23]. Since the thymus is the \nprimary lymphoid organ essential for the develop­\nment of T lymphocytes, its decreased functioning \ncould lead to a drastic decrease in these T cells \n[24]. Moreover, one of the age-related changes in \nthe immune system is the impaired generation of \nprimary T cell responses against infection [24, 25].\nSome facts about fats…\nWhite adipose tissue is an active endocrine \norgan consisting of mature and developing ad­\nipocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells \nsuch as adipose tissue macrophages, neutrophils, \neosinophils, mast cells, and T and B cells. Thus, \npeople with a normal body weight have a balance \nbetween adipocytes and immune cells which \nmaintains tissue homeostasis. In particular, eo­\nsinophils and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) secrete \nanti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) that \ndirect adipose tissue macrophages towards the an­\nti-inflammatory phenotype, thereby maintaining \na tolerogenic environment. This condition is also \nassociated with the production of adiponectin, \nwhich increases insulin sensitivity [26, 27].\nIn turn, obesity causes adipocyte prolifer­\nation which leads to increased leptin secretion \nand infiltration of inflammatory cells. Adipocyte \nhypoxia and cellular stress were able to induce \nthe expression of chemoattractant molecules with \na consistent recruitment of macrophages, T cells, \nand B cells. When T cells are activated, the num­\nber of Treg cells is reduced [28]. The phenotype \nof macrophages changes from M2 to M1, which in \nturn accumulate around adipocytes and produce \nlarge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such \nas TNF-α. In addition, obesity is characterized by \na dysregulated secretion of adipokines such as \nleptin, adiponectin, LCN2, and PGRN which have \nbecome key regulators of the innate and adaptive \nimmune systems [27, 28].\nThere is a lot of evidence showing a worse \nprognosis in obese patients infected with the \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 335–342\n338\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nSARS-CoV-2 virus, especially among young peo­\nple. It should also be mentioned that obesity is \na well-known risk factor for respiratory diseas­\nes. Excessive growth of fat leads to hyperactiva­\ntion of interleukin-6 and chronic inflammation \nwhich increases the risk of acquiring comor­\nbidities such as diabetes and hypertension [27]. \nAgain, both hypertension and diabetes are listed \namong the most prevalent risk factors for a worse \nprognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection [12, 27].\nWhen discussing the relationship between \nthe inflammatory process and obesity in the \nSARS-COV-2 infection, we also have to discuss \nthe role of mitochondria.\nGenerally speaking, mitochondria are mul­\ntifunctional cellular organelles which play an \nimportant role in numerous aspects of cell mor­\nphology and physiology such as the synthesis of \nadenosine triphosphate (ATP), intracellular trans­\nfer of energy, redox homeostasis, regulation of \ncellular metabolism [29], cellular calcium homeo­\nstasis, synthesis of steroids [30], and apoptosis \n[31, 32]. However, mitochondria also play a key \nrole in initiating inflammatory pathways. Mito­\nchondrial dysfunction drives the ageing process \nby reducing cellular fitness, inflicting damage \nto other organelles, and/or causing mutations \nof the nuclear genome. One critical mechanism \nunderlying the dysfunction of mitochondria is \nthe accumulation of mutations and deletion of \naged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is \na consequence of the decline in mitochondrial \nautophagy (mitophagy). This process seems to \ndecline in ageing individuals as the expression \nof several key components is decreased [33]. \nThe dysfunction of mitophagy leads to the accu­\nmulation of damaged mitochondria, which then \ninitiates inflammasomes and other inflammatory \npathways. Mitochondria are essential for the \nNLRP3 inflammasome activation because they \ncan activate NLRP3 inflammasomes by producing \nROS. Furthermore, ROS-mediated mitochondrial \npermeability transition facilitates the release of \nmtDNA, which can stimulate pro-inflammatory \nsignaling via the pattern recognition receptors \nRIG-I and MDA5, promoting the activation of NF-\nκB and interferon regulatory factors [33]. \nBased on the available data for SARS-CoV-2, \nits RNA is also located in mitochondria. It is \npostulated that SARS-CoV-2 transcripts found \nin mitochondria may affect mitochondrial func­\ntion via ACE2 to avoid host cell immunity and \nto facilitate viral replication and COVID-19 dis­\nease [34]. Additionally, manipulation of host \nmitochondria by viral open-reading frames can \nrelease mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cy­\ntoplasm which can potentially serve as a potent \ndanger-associated molecular pattern and can \nactivate mtDNA-induced inflammasomes. This, \nin turn, can suppress both innate and adaptive \nimmunity [33, 35]. \nEvil, damned evil and cigarette smoking…\nThe commonly accepted mechanism of \nSARS-CoV-2 cell entry is via use of the angioten­\nsin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor [36]. \nSome earlier papers suggested that smoking and \nnicotine are strong factors down-regulating ACE \n2 expression [37]. Contrarily, results of current \nstudies on airway epithelia are different [38, \n39]. A potential adhesion site for SARS-CoV-2 is \nup-regulated in smokers independent of coex­\nisting COPD. In the lung, SARS-Cov-2 infection \nand down-regulation of ACE2 receptors leads \nto increased angiotensin II activity that direct­\nly causes uncontrolled inflammation and lung \ndamage [40, 41]. Although it has been suggested \nthat an increase in the expression of ACE2 may \ncontribute to the severe form of SARS-CoV-2-in­\nduced infection, it actually might be beneficial. \nThus, looking for a prevalence of past or current \nsmokers among COVID-19 patients might explain \nthe important question both from a practical and \ntheoretical point of view. Observational studies \nin China and in Italy have suggested that ARDS \namong smoking COVID patients is less prevalent \nthan in patients who never smoked [42, 43]. The \nconvincing meta-analysis of updated results from \nChina confirms that active smoking is significant­\nly associated with a risk of severe COVID-19 [44].\nSmoking is strongly accompanied by neutro­\nphilic airway inflammation [45]. SARS-CoV-2 in­\nfection induces biphasic immune responses. In \nthe incubation stage, both innate and adaptive \nimmunity are responsible for virus elimination. \nTherefore, inflammation can be limited, and the \ndisease does not develop. Nearly 80% of infected \npeople are only carriers of the infection [46]. \nIn the second phase, when the protective \nresponse is diminished, the virus will propagate. \nTissues damage develops following inflammation \nthat is mostly mediated by neutrophils and mac­\nrophages and is especially noticeable in organs \nrich in ACE 2 receptors such as the lungs and \nkidneys. This cytokine storm seems to be mainly \nattributed to interleukin 6 [47]. \nThere is no doubt that neutrophilic inflam­\nmation can be evoked and amplified by different \nfactors. Smoking and other forms of indoor or \nAdam J Białas et al., Ageing, sex, smoking and COVID-19\n339\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\noutdoor air pollution are two factors in the pub­\nlic space that can evoke neutrophilic infiltration \nof the lungs. Air pollutants have been shown \nto be important factors influencing both virus \ntransmission and COVID development [48]. It \nis logical that the inflammatory process is am­\nplified by smoking in severe stages of COVID. \nControversies can arise, however, if nicotine, \nthe stable constituent of cigarettes, is found to \nbe protective against COVID progression. Nic­\notine has been found to be an agent that can \nprevent the onset of Acute Respiratory Distress \nSyndrome in animal models [49]. Nicotine has \nsome anti-inflammatory properties due to agonis­\ntic cholinergic action [50]. Moreover, it inhibits \nthe production of IL-6 and some other cytokines \nwith no influence on interleukin-10 release [51]. \nNicotine is approved by the FDA for medical \nuse, but with many contraindications. Nicotine’s \nmechanism of action might explain the contro­\nversies surrounding the influence of smoking on \nCOVID initiation [52, 53]. However, emerging \ndata indicate that both past and especially current \nsmoking is an important determinant of worsen­\ning COVID-19 outcomes. This can have a positive \neffect on patients trying to quit smoking because \nthe potential severity of the infection combined \nwith the general knowledge about the harmful \ninfluence of smoking creates a situation where \npatients may consider smoking cessation. In fact, \nduring the pandemic, many smokers tried to quit \ntheir smoking habit [54–56].\nFor individuals who use e-cigarettes, it is \nimportant to remember that they also have many \nharmful properties and can create a real hazard \nfor future smoking addiction [57]. Heat-not-burn \n(HNB) tobacco products produce aerosol like \ntraditional cigarettes, but with a lower level of \nharmful constituents, including carcinogens. It \nis important to remember that the impact of HNB \nproducts on population-level risk reduction will \nbe maximized if smokers completely switch to \nthe product (and abandon cigarettes). Individuals \nwho use these products will find that their daily \nnicotine exposure remains stable or is reduced. \nThat being said, the product will only reduce pop­\nulation-level risk if it does not attract non-smokers \n[58, 59]. To date, no study on vaping or HNB prod­\nuct use during COVID is available and discussing \nthe possible result of replacing cigarette smoking \nwith less harmful products is pure speculation. \nHowever, it seems logical that in smokers in whom \nall methods of smoking cessation were ineffective, \nnew and different methods for combatting tobacco \naddiction should be explored.\nTo sum up this part of our considerations, \nit is evident that smoking promotes the progress \nof COVID-19. Paraphrasing Mark Twain, one can \nsay that “there is evil, damned evil and ciga­\nrette smoking”. Because of sociopsychological \ncircumstances, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an \nopportune time for smoking cessation in addicted \npeople. The potential anti-inflammatory activity \nof nicotine does not seem to be significant see­\ning as the majority of studies show smoking as \na promoting factor in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nHowever, nicotine replacement therapy (patches, \ngums) might be used during cessation therapy \nbecause of possible anti-inflammatory properties \nand a small risk of potential side effects. During \nsmoking cessation, all known methods (i.e. psy­\nchosocial support, cytisine, varenicline) can be \nused. In smokers unable to quit smoking tradi­\ntional cigarettes using these methods, using HNB \nproducts instead of traditional cigarettes may \nbe recommended. According to a report by an \nindependent study of Polish people trying to quit \nsmoking, 50% of HNB product users achieved \nsuccess. This is more than users of e-cigarettes, \nwhere only 25% of individuals succeeded. More­\nover, in many young people, nicotine dependence \nstarts from the use of e-cigarettes [23]. We do \nnot recommend e-cigarettes since the balance \nof potential advantages and disadvantages from \na public health point of view is negative. \nWhen the lungs wear the pants…\nSex seems to be an interesting issue in the \ncontext of COVID-19. Notably, recent survival \nanalysis performed by Li et al. revealed that \nmale sex was one of the significant risk factors \nassociated with death in patients with severe \nCOVID-19 [6]. Chen et al., in their early report \nfrom Wuhan, also reported that those who died \nin their cohort were more likely to be male [4]. \nSimilarly, higher risks have been reported for men \nin the Italian population [7]. Another study by \nJin et al. focused purely on gender differences in \npatients with COVID-19 in the context of severity \nand mortality and concluded that while males and \nfemales have the same prevalence, men infected \nwith COVID-19 are at a greater risk for worse \noutcomes and death, independent of age [8]. \nIn terms of analysis, we should initially ex­\namine differences in the expression of ACE2 by \ngender. Notably, it is activated and down-reg­\nulated by the spike protein of the virus which \nallows for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into \nepithelial cells and the myocardium. There is \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 335–342\n340\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nevidence suggesting that hypertensive male \nmice have a spontaneously higher myocardial \nACE2 expression than females, and that its levels \ndecrease after orchiectomy [60]. This observation \nis concordant with the strong body of evidence \nindicating that ACE2 expression and activity may \nbe influenced by sex hormones [61–65]. In light \nof this evidence, La Vignera et al. suggested that \ntestosterone (or LH/hCG) administration could \nbe temporarily discontinued or given at a lower \nposology in patients with hypogonadism, while \nestrogen replacement therapy may be considered \nin hypogonadal and postmenopausal women [60]. \nMale vulnerability to COVID-19 may be fur­\nther enhanced by X-linked inheritance of genetic \npolymorphisms seeing as loci of both androgen \nreceptors and ACE2 genes are located on the\nX chromosome [66].\nOn the other hand, ACE2 is also expressed \nin the testes (in spermatogonia, Leydig cells, and \nSertoli cells) [67–69]. Ma et al. found that the level \nof serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was signifi­\ncantly increased, but that the ratio of testosterone \nto LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone \nto LH was significantly decreased in males with \nCOVID-19. This evidence, showing disturbances \nin male gonadal function, indicates the need for \nan increased focus on the evaluation of gonadal \nfunction among patients who have recovered \nfrom the SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in \nreproductive-aged men [67]. \nAnother interesting issue in the context of \nsex is transmembrane serine protease 2 (TM­\nPRSS2) which is a critical factor in enabling \ncellular infection by coronaviruses, including \nSARS-CoV-2. Notably, androgen receptor activity \nseems to be required for the transcription of the \nTMPRSS2 [66, 70]. \nIn turn, McCoy et al. hypothesized that \nandrogen receptor genetic variants associated \nwith prostate cancer and androgenetic alopecia \nwould be associated with racial variations in \nCOVID-19 mortality. Authors also suggest that \nthe use of anti-androgens like bicalutamide and \nenzalutamide or androgen modulators like fin­\nasteride and dutasteride may be beneficial [71].\nAdditionally, we have to emphasize that an \nincreasing body of evidence indicates that there \nare dimorphic immune response differences to \nviral infections between males and females. These \ndifferences are unfavorable for males, who pres­\nent with a higher mortality rate in epidemiolog­\nical studies. Indeed, females mount a stronger \nimmune response to viral infections due to more \nrobust humoral and cellular immune responses.\nIt is suggested that estrogen and testosterone dif­\nferentially alter expression of genes involved in \ninnate immunity (i.e. those encoding TLRs and \ninterferons) thereby contributing to sexual dimor­\nphism in the response to viral infections. These \nissues may also contribute to sex differences in \nthe natural history of COVID-19.\nHowever, most of the above-mentioned issues \nare just hypotheses and should be further verified. \nThis is especially true in terms of the specific \nroles and levels of androgens in the pathobiology \nof COVID-19. \nConclusions \nThis review highlights the important role of \nageing, sex, and smoking in the pathobiology and \nclinical landscape of COVID-19. We especially \nfocused on their significant role in disease sever­\nity and mortality. However, in spite of intensive \nresearch, most of the presented pieces of evidence \nare weak and need further verification. \nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences:\n1.\t Zhu Na, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

Its patho-\ngenesis is integrally linked to asbestos exposure. In spite of recent developments providing a more detailed understanding of \nthe pathogenesis, the outcomes continue to be poor. To date, trimodality therapy involving surgery coupled with chemotherapy \nand/or radiotherapy remains the standard of therapy. The development of resistance of the tumor cells to radiation and several \nchemotherapeutic agents poses even greater challenges in the management of this cancer. Ionizing radiation damages cancer cell \nDNA and aids in therapeutic response, but it also activates cell survival signaling pathways that helps the tumor cells to overcome \nradiation-induced cytotoxicity. A careful evaluation of the biology involved in mesothelioma with an emphasis on the workings of \npro-survival signaling pathways might offer some guidance for treatment options. This review focuses on the existing treatment \noptions for MPM, novel treatment approaches based on recent studies combining the use of inhibitors which target different \npro-survival pathways, and radiotherapy to optimize treatment.\nKey words: mesothelioma, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 343–351\nIntroduction\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) \nis a rare and aggressive cancer with a reported \nworldwide incidence of only 10 to 30 cases per \nmillion [1]. This malignancy involves the meso-\nthelial cells of the pleura and its pathogenesis \nis attributed to a direct causal relationship with \nprolonged exposure to airborne asbestos parti-\ncles.  Chronic exposure to asbestos leads to in-\nflammatory changes in the pleural mesothelium, \nsubsequently leading to malignant transformation \n[2]. The most common sub-type of MPM is the \nepithelioid variety, followed by the sarcomatous \nand biphasic types [3]. \nThe current standard treatment strategies for \nMPM include surgery for resectable tumors in \ncombination with radiotherapy (RT) and chemo-\ntherapy. In spite of recent advances and research \nfocused towards novel approaches to manage \nMPM, the median survival of patients with MPM \nis still estimated to be 8 to 14 months [4]. With the \nemerging resistance of the MPM tumor cells to RT \nand chemotherapy, there is an even greater need \nfor developing new treatment approaches which \ncan bypass and overcome these obstacles. Cancer \nimmunotherapy has shown tremendous promise \nin providing solutions which can aid in improving \nthe poor outcomes that continue to be associated \nwith MPM. A more detailed understanding of \nthe molecular biological mechanisms in MPM \nhas provided hope that novel combinations of \ntargeted therapies along with administration of ra-\ndiation can be successfully developed to enhance \nthe immune response against this malignancy. In \nview of this, we evaluate the available treatment \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 343–351\n344\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nmodalities for MPM, with a particular emphasis \nplaced on the various cell survival pathways and \nthe latest developments in the field of targeted \nchemotherapy and immunotherapy.  \nCurrent treatment approaches in MPM\nThe trimodality treatment involving sur-\ngery in combination with chemotherapy and/or \nradiotherapy continues to be the standard ap-\nproach for management of MPM. Being an \nimportant and common treatment option in \nthe treatment of MPM, surgery has been em-\nployed to either potentially cure the cancer or \nto provide palliation. The two main surgical \nmethods include extra-pleural pneumonectomy \n(EPP) and pleurectomy with decortication (P/D). \nThe preferred surgical of MPM continues to be \nwidely debated with several studies showing \nconflicting results. Some retrospective studies \nhave favored extended P/D, because it shows \nlower peri-operative mortality, morbidity, lower \npost-operative complications and better survival \nwhen compared to EPP (5, 6). Owing to the lack \nof randomized control trials, a clear conclusion \nof the optimal surgical procedure cannot yet be \nclearly determined. The National Comprehen-\nsive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for MPM \nsuggest that P/D is considered safer to EPP due \nto less post-operative complications and a higher \nquality of life. \nRT is employed as an adjuvant or neoadju-\nvant treatment option in MPM and is mainly \nconsidered a palliative option [7]. Intensity \nmodulated proton therapy has been suggested \nas a feasible option in the management of MPM \nin a recent study involving 7 patients [8]. Volu-\nmetric modulated arc therapy, a rotational form \nof intensity-modulated RT has also been consid-\nered in management of MPM [9]. Chemotherapy \nis considered a part of the trimodality regimen \nfor MPM in patients, either before or after sur-\ngery and has shown to provide a median OS of \n24 months [10]. In patients who refuse surgery \nand in medically inoperable patients, chemother-\napy alone can also be considered [11]. The first-\nline treatment for MPM includes a combination \nof pemetrexed and cisplatin. Based on a recent \nstudy by Zalcman et al., the NCCN guidelines \nrecommended addition of bevacizumab to cis-\nplatin-pemetrexed regimen for patients with \nunresectable MPM [12]. Pemetrexed-carboplatin \nand gemcitabine-cisplatin have also been recom-\nmended as acceptable first-line regimens based \non relevant recent studies [13, 14].\nInduction of cell survival pathways\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \npathway\nEGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein which \nbelongs to the Her1 group of the ErbB family of \ntyrosine kinases [15]. This receptor forms an in-\ntegral part of a complex signaling cascade which \nplays an important role in physiological pathways \nincluding controlling cell growth, proliferation and \nsurvival. Ligand binding to EGFR, phosphorylation \nof tyrosine residues, followed by receptor dimeriza-\ntion are the three steps which lead to cellular prolif-\neration [16]. The overexpression of these receptors \nhas been deemed significant in the pathogenesis \nof several cancers, which has led to the focus on \ndevelopment of targeted therapies towards these \nreceptors [17]. Overexpression of EGFR is noted \nin about 70% of tissue specimens of MPM [18]. \nAsbestos, which is the major carcinogen associated \nwith MPM, triggers aggregation of EGFR by forming \nreactive oxygen species, resulting in autophosphor-\nylation and EGFR activation. This is subsequently \nfollowed by activation of the RAS/RAF/MAPK \npathway leading to cellular proliferation and me-\ntastasis [19, 20]. There are several studies which \nhave focused on EGFR gene mutations involved in \nMPM over the last few years. A study conducted \nin Japan demonstrated the presence of missense \nmutations of the EGFR gene in some cases of MPM \n[21]. Recent studies have suggested an epigenetic \ncomponent involved in development of MPM. \nMoreover, oncogenic EGFR gene has been shown to \ncause downregulation and repression of Ten-elev-\nen translocation enzymes (TET) DNA methylase, \nwhich leads to silencing of tumor suppressors [22].\nThe effect of radiation on the proliferation of \ntumor cells and association with EGFR has been \nstudied extensively. The amplification of cellular \nproliferation after exposure to ionizing radiation \nis termed as accelerated repopulation and has \nbeen shown to be contributing partly to the de-\nvelopment of radioresistance, especially in head \nand neck malignancies [23]. The possible mech-\nanisms of EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent \nactivation by radiation has been attributed to the \nrelease of TGF-alpha, which is an EGFR binding \nligand [24]. A study detailing the effects of the \ncombination of RT with ZD1839 (Iressa), which \nis a selective EGFR inhibitor in several cancers \nincluding mesotheliomas, conclusively showed \nthat the combination arm yielded significant \nimprovements in therapeutic index for radiation \nand enhanced tumor suppression compared to \nthe radiation alone arm [25].\nMutlay Sayan et al., Novel therapies for mesothelioma\n345\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nThe two classes of drugs with established \nanti-EGFR targeted action are tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors (TKI) and monoclonal antibodies. TKIs \nsuch as gefitinib, afatinib, erlotinib, canertinib \nand lapertinib impart their action by acting as \nATP analogues, competitively inhibiting the \ncatalytic tyrosine kinase domain intracellularly. \nIn-vitro studies have demonstrated that small \nmolecule TKIs effectively decrease MPM cell \nproliferation [26]. However, initial clinical trials \ninvolving gefitinib showed no clinical efficacy in \npatients with MPM [27]. This contrast has been \nattributed to the theory that TKIs exert their ac-\ntion only in the presence of activating mutations \nof the EGFR gene, which are very rarely seen in \nMPM. As very few patients carry these mutations, \nthe clinical efficacy of these drugs, when given \nindividually, is lacking [28]. A Japanese study \nhas been conducted in a patient harboring a rare \nEGFR mutation of G719C and S768I had been \nsuccessfully treated with afatinib [29].\nMonoclonal antibodies against the extra-\ncellular portion of EGFR such as cetuximab, \nnimotuzumab and panitumumab act by creating \nligand inhibition, thereby blocking receptor di-\nmerization and further downstream signaling. \nThey also cause internalization and degradation \nof EGFR receptors leading to further downreg-\nulation [30]. The use of cetuximab, a chimeric \nmouse-human antibody, in rodent models has \ndemonstrated significant tumor inhibition and \nimproved survival [31]. Another monoclonal \nantibody, Nimotuzumab, approved for the treat-\nment of colorectal and head and neck cancers, \nhas demonstrated significant reduction in tumor \nvolumes when compared to cisplatin-gemcitabine \nchemotherapy in animal models [32]. Novel EGFR \ntargeted nanotechnology delivery techniques \nsuch as TargomiRs which are targeted minicells \nwhich are loaded with miR-16 mimic microRNA \nhave also shown promise in preclinical models \nand clinical trials [33, 34].\nExtracellular signal-regulated kinase \n(ERK) pathway\nMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) \npathway, which forms an integral link between \nupstream extracellular stimuli and downstream \nintracellular effectors, regulates cell differentia-\ntion, proliferation and death in both physiologi-\ncal and pathological milieus [35]. This cascade, \nwhich has been identified to be the most fre-\nquently mutated signaling pathway in humans, \nis composed of a RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK chain. Two \ntypes of distinct ERK proteins, ERK1 and ERK2, \nare activated by MEK through phosphorylation of \ntheir tyrosine and threonine residues, which re-\nsults in the activation of transcription factors and \nkinases which predominantly orchestrates cellu-\nlar proliferation. Activation of several feedback \nloops between substrates and ERK further am-\nplifies cell differentiation [36]. The significance \nof ERK has been clearly demonstrated in studies \nrelated to epithelioid type of MPM. ERK2 was \nconclusively shown to be critical in the trans-\nformation and homeostasis of mesotheliomas by \ncontrolling gene expression in animal studies \n[37]. An in-depth analysis of asbestos-induced \nsignaling pathways also reiterated the impor-\ntance of ERK in the development of malignant \nmesothelioma. The transcription factor activator \nprotein-1 controls proliferation of mesothelial \ncells by elevation of ERK-dependent Fos-related \nantigen (Fra)-1 [38]. Thus, downstream ERK, \nwhich controls a critical juncture in this pathway, \nhas been targeted as a potential opportunity for \ntreatment of cancers, especially those with MEK, \nRAF and RAS mutations. \nRadiation leads to activation of the ERK \npathway by causing tyrosine and threonine phos-\nphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 by MEK, which \nprolongs cell survival and proliferation [39]. This \nactivation of ERK by radiation leads to expression \nof anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1, and \nBcl-xL [40]. It also inhibits some pro-apoptotic \nproteins such as caspase 9 and Bim, leading to \nthe inhibition of tumor cell suppression [41]. \nA link between radioresistance and ERK5 has \nbeen established in a study by Jiang et al. which \nshowed that ERK5 overactivation was noted in \nlung cancer development and G2/M cycle trans-\nmission. ERK5 was also identified as a potential \nregulator of radiosensitivity in cancer cells and \nsupported its use as a biomarker to predict radio-\nsensitivity [42]. \nIn therapeutic targeting of the MAPK path-\nway, the initial design and development of newer \ndrugs was focused on RAF and MEK proteins. The \ninevitable drug resistance that develops against \nRAF and MEK inhibitors has shifted the fo-\ncus to novel ERK inhibitors. Use of a specific \nERK5 inhibitor XMD8-92 in human MPM cells \nconclusively showed inhibition of ERK5 phos-\nphorylation, which eventually led to attenuation \nof MPM tumor growth by an inflammasome-me-\ndiated mechanism [43]. A recent study demon-\nstrated that zoledronic acid can potentially aid \nin restoring immune reactivity and chemosen-\nsitivity in MPM by decreasing RAS/ERK activity \n[44]. A single-arm clinical trial carried out in \nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 343–351\n346\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\n8 patients with advanced MPM showed modest \nclinical activity and no significant toxic effects \nin patients who received zoledronic acid [45]. \nAn in vivo microenvironment study showed \nthat Pirfenidone can decrease proliferation and \nmigration of MPM cells by causing inhibition of \nERK [46]. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an inorganic \ncompound used in traditional Chinese medicine, \nhas been shown to induce apoptosis in MPM cell \nlines by affecting MAPK pathways such as ERK \nand c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway [47]. \nIn addition to these mechanisms, ATO has also \ndemonstrated apoptosis in MPM cell lines by \ndownregulating thymidylate synthase, Gli1 ex-\npression and E2F1 transcription factor [48, 49]. \nThe potential benefits of these agents in all these \nstudies provide a possible option in the future for \nrepurposing them for use in MPM patients. \ncAMP response element binding protein \n(CREB)\nCREB, which belongs to the group of basic \nleucine zipper (bZIP) containing transcription \nfactors, is a major regulator of basic cellular \nhomeostasis, differentiation and growth [50]. \nAfter undergoing phosphorylation at its serine \nresidues by other kinases, the transcriptional \nactivity of CREB is activated [51]. Subsequently \nby regulating histone H3 and H4 methylation \nwhich controls chromatin recruitment, CREB \nmodulates a number of physiological processes \nsuch as cell cycle, DNA repair, cell proliferation, \nangiogenesis, inflammation and immune respons-\nes [52, 53]. Overexpression of CREB has been \nimplicated in many cancers such as glioblastoma, \nnon-small cell lung carcinoma, breast carcino-\nma, hematopoietic malignancies and malignant \nmesothelioma, to name a few [54, 55]. CREB \noverexpression has also been shown to correlate \nwith tumor recurrences, poorer prognoses and \nreduced survival in tumor patients [56, 57]. Sev-\neral studies have emphasized the role of CREB in \nthe pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma. An \nin vitro study conducted on MPM cells showed \nthat asbestos induced apoptosis also triggered \nthe expression of several CREB target genes. It \nalso demonstrated that doxorubicin increased the \nphosphorylation of CREB1 [58]. Another study \nusing genetically CREB-silenced MPM cell lines \nand mouse xenograft models, conclusively proved \nthat by regulating inflammatory signals, CREB \nplays a major role in controlling MPM tumor \ngrowth and development [59].\nThe activation of CREB following induction \nwith radiation has been linked to radiosensitiv-\nity in several studies.  A study by D’Auria et al. \nsuggested that low dose radiation can trigger ac-\ntivation of CREB leading to cell survival. It also \nreviewed the pro-apoptotic role of CREB after \nexposure to ionizing radiation. This suggests that \nmultiple mechanisms are involved in the radi-\nation-CREB interaction and that future clinical \ntrials involving this combination can provide \na solution in cancer treatment [60]. Another study \nby Cataldi et al. showed that activation of CREB \nimproves signal in leukemia cells which were \nexposed to ionizing radiation [61].\nKG-501, a CREB inhibitor has been identi-\nfied which can reversibly inhibit the interaction \nbetween CREB and CBP (CREB binding protein). \nThe use of vandetanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibi-\ntor, along with doxorubicin in human MPM lines \ndemonstrated that vandetanib alone decreased \ncell numbers in epithelioid cell lines and when \nused together synergistically resulted in increased \ndoxorubicin toxicity in both epithelioid and sar-\ncomatous cell lines [62]. This study suggested the \ncombined use of these two drugs as a potential \ntreatment option for MPM, owing to the impact \non both ERK5 and CREB pathways. A new agent \n666-15 has been identified as a CREB inhibitor \nwith significant anti-tumor effects noted in both \nin vivo and in vitro studies and it holds promise \nas a future therapeutic option for MPM [63, 64].\nProtein kinase B (AKT)\nAKT is a serine/threonine kinase which \nexists as 3 isoforms and controls many cellular \nactivities such as glucose metabolism, cell cycle \nprogression and protein synthesis. It also blocks \napoptosis by causing inactivation of several \npro-apoptotic proteins [65, 66]. After being acti-\nvated by phosphorylation, AKT induces a number \nof proteins located in the nucleus, cytosol and \nplasma membrane such as PRAS40, vimentin, \npalladin, p21 and p27 which enhance metastatic \nproliferation of cells [67, 68]. The system located \nupstream of AKT generates phosphatidylinositol \ntriphosphate (PIP3) with the action of phos-\nphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [69]. AKT over \nactivation has been commonly noted in several \nhuman malignancies including ovarian carci-\nnoma, gastric carcinoma and pancreatic cancer \n[70]. Some proteins in the AKT pathway such as \nPI3K, periostin, eIF4E function as oncoproteins \nwhen they are overexpressed. On the other hand, \ninactivation of tumor suppressor genes in the AKT \npathway such as PTEN, TSC and FOXO leads \ntowards malignancy causing paths, with PTEN \nmutations being the highest frequency [71, 72]. \nMutlay Sayan et al., Novel therapies for mesothelioma\n347\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nThe role of radiation on AKT pathway has \nbeen analyzed in many studies. Li et al. conclu-\nsively proved in a study involving 8 cell lines of \nglioblastoma multiforme that induction of AKT \nactivation by ionizing radiation led to an in-\ncrease in radioresistance of the cancer cells. They \nshowed that a serum factor may be involved and \nEGFR inhibition by AG1478 and PI3K inhibition \nwith LY294002 can help increase radiosensitivity \nin tumor cells [73]. Toulany et al. pointed out that \nunderstanding the specific dysregulations of AKT \nsuch as gene amplification, point mutations and \noverexpression, which eventually lead to AKT \nactivation might result in a clearer estimate of the \noutcome to radiation administration [74]. They \ndemonstrated that the dual inhibition of AKT \nand MEK increased radiosensitivity in k-RAS \nmutated non-small cell lung cancer. They also \nemphasized the control of DNA double strand \nrepair by AKT activation might serve as a future \ntarget to enhance radiosensitivity. \nSeveral studies have dealt with the associa-\ntion between abnormalities in AKT/PI3K pathway \nand its role in the pathogenesis of MPM. In a study \nconducted by Suzuki et al. in 21 MPM cell lines, \ndownregulation of PTEN was most frequently \nidentified as the cause for activation of AKT path-\nway [75]. A study by Varghese et al. on the molec-\nular nature of MPM conclusively proved that ac-\ntivation of PI3K and mTOR resulted in shortened \nsurvival in patients with MPM [76]. Zhou et al. \ndemonstrated that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway \nis a crucial cascade downstream of multiple acti-\nvated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) suggesting \nthe future potential of multi-point targeting of \nPI3K/mTOR as a therapeutic consideration in \nmesothelioma. Dual targeting of PI3K/mTOR by \nBEZ235 had a more significant effect on MPM \ninhibition compared to individual inhibition [77]. \nAKT kinase interacting protein (Aki1) is a scaffold \nprotein for the PI3K–PDK1–AKT module. A study \nby Yamada et al. in cell-based assays showed that \nAki1 silencing affected the CREB pathway and led \nto decreased cell viability in MPM tumors [78].\nProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) \nProgrammed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) is \nexpressed on activated T cells and with its li-\ngands PD-L1 and PDL2, it controls T-cell effector \nfunctions [79]. Several studies have demonstrated \nthat PD-L1 overexpression is noted in around \n30–40% of MPM patients, with a relatively great-\ner incidence in non-epithelioid subtypes [80]. \nMoreover, MPM with PD-L1 positivity has signifi-\ncantly been associated with a poorer prognosis \nthan PD-L1 negative MPM (median survival of \n4.8–5.0 months vs 14.5-16.3 months) [81, 82]. \nThis finding led to the consideration that immune \ncheckpoint inhibitors which affect PD-L1 can \nprovide benefit in MPM.\nPembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal \nantibody against PD-1, with a favorable safety \nprofile and strong anti-tumor activity, has been \napproved for use in the management of several \nmalignancies in more than 50 countries [83]. \nOne of the first studies which involved pembroli-\nzumab in MPM was the Keynote-028 Phase I trial \nconducted in 25 patients, and it showed a disease \ncontrol rate (DCR) of 72%, a response rate of 20%, \na median response duration of 12 months and \nwas well tolerated [84]. Single arm phase II trials \ninvolving nivolumab, which also has PD-1 action \nshowed objective response rates (ORR) between \n15–29% and a median progression free survival \n(mPFS) between 2.6–6.1 months [85, 86]. Another \nagent avelumab, which has PD-L1 blocking ac-\ntivity, had a response rate of 9.4% in a study of \n53 patients [87]. The CONFIRM trial, involving \n336 patients with MPM randomized to nivolumab \nor placebo, which is ongoing in the UK hopefully \nwill shed more light on this aspect [88].\nCytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated \nantigen (CTLA-4) \nCTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor located on T \nlymphocytes, binds competitively to CD80 and \nCD86 ligands and attenuates CD28-mediated T \ncell activation. By inhibiting CTLA-4, there can \nbe an increase in T cell activation which aids in \nmounting stronger anti-tumor immune respons-\nes. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab belong to the \nCTLA-4 family and have shown significant ben-\nefit in patients with advanced malignancies [89, \n90].  Retrospective analysis of the phase II ME-\nSOT-TREM-2008 study revealed that the dosage of \ntremelimumab (15 mg/kg every 90 days) in chemo-\ntherapy-resistant advanced MPM was low [91]. This \nwas followed by the MESOT-TREM-2012 trial with \nan increased dosage of tremelimumab (10 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks, and after 6 cycles every 12 weeks). \nCompared to 1 patient who achieved partial re-\nsponse in the 2008 study, 11 patients achieved \ndisease control in the 2012 study [92]. Following \nthe success of these 2 studies, the DETERMINE \ntrial was conducted, a randomized controlled trial \ninvolving 571 patients who were randomized to \ntremelimumab or placebo arm. However, this study \nshowed that tremelimumab did not significantly \nprolong survival or improve response in patients \nwith previously treated MM [93].\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 343–351\n348\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nA combination therapy of PD-L1 and \nCTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors has also been \nstudied with the aim to look for a more effective \nresponse in MPM patients. The MAPS-II trial, \nwhich included 125 patients with relapsed MPM \nacross 21 hospitals in France, compared nivolum-\nab (anti-PD1) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab \n(anti-CTLA4). It was concluded at the end of the \nstudy that nivolumab with or without ipilimumab \nshowed an equally meaningful clinical response \nbut higher drug-related adverse events where \nnoted in the combination group (93% in combina-\ntion vs 89% in monotherapy) [94]. A combination \nof tremelimumab and durvalumab in the NIBIT \ntrial conducted in 40 patients with MPM showed \ncomparable results to the MAPS-II trial [95].  \nThe INITIATE trial, a single-arm phase II trial in \n36 eligible patients with recurrent MPM, studied \nthe combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab. \nA response rate of 38% and a DCR of 68% was \nnoted at the study conclusion, but 94% reported \nexperiencing an adverse event [96]. \nDendritic cell (DC) therapy\nDCs have often been referred to as “nature’s \nadjuvants” owing to the important role they \ncarry out in initiating an immune response by \ncapturing antigens and efficiently presenting \nthem to lymphoid T cells. DCs also modulate \nhumoral immunity by directly interacting with \nB cells and indirectly with CD4+ T helper cells \n[98]. Over the last decade, DCs have become an \nintegral target in cancer immunotherapy. A study \nby Cornelissen et al. in 10 patients with MPM, \nDCs were administered with cyclophosphamide \nshowed a promising overall mean survival of \n37 months (98). A recently performed clinical trial \nin which 9 patients with MPM were administered \nDCs pulsed with allogenic tumor lysate, 2 patients \nshowed a partial response and a median OS \nhigher than 22.8 months in all the patients [99].\nConclusion\nMPM is an aggressive cancer of the pleural \nlining and continues to present challenges in its \nmanagement. Radioresistance of the tumor cells \nas well as increasing resistance to chemothera-\npeutic agents, have made the achievement of opti-\nmal response rates difficult. A better understand-\ning of the various cell survival and pro-apoptotic \nsignal pathways might open up new avenues \nin the treatment of MPM. Employing inhibitors \ntargeting EGFR, ERK, CREB and AKT pathways, \nin combination with radiotherapy, might help in \novercoming the radiation resistance developed \nby tumor cells after administration of RT. Novel \ncombinations of such small molecule inhibitors \nwith existing approved chemotherapy regimens \nfor MPM is also another possible alternative. \nTreatment options might also be available in the \nfuture in the domain of immunotherapy with \nseveral recent studies on inhibitors of PD-L1, \nCTLA-4 and dendritic cells showing promising \nresults. There is a need to continue making efforts \nto further substantiate and deepen the under-\nstanding of the molecular mechanisms involved \nin MPM and to conduct clinical trials with the \ngoal of optimizing treatment of MPM.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences:\n1.\t Kameda T, Takahashi K, Kim R, et al.

He developed hyponatremia (serum sodium 105 mEq/L) on day 3 of therapy. The potential \ncauses of hyponatremia were evaluated. After ruling out other causes, the cause was suspected to be Cotrimoxazole-induced \nsyndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). We subsequently re-initiated therapy with Cotrimoxazole and \nthe hyponatremia (serum sodium 110 mEq/L) recurred. Upon discontinuation of therapy, serum sodium levels returned to normal. \nThe patient was started on Amoxycillin-Clavulanic Acid as an alternative therapy for pulmonary nocardiosis which resulted in \nresolution of the hyponatremia. Cotrimoxazole-induced SIADH is a rare occurrence. This case is representative of a patient with \nCotrimoxazole-induced SIADH and the causal relationship was confirmed once resumption of therapy with the offending medi-\ncation resulted in hyponatremia. \nClinicians should be aware of this rare adverse effect of Cotrimoxazole and should monitor serum electrolytes during therapy, \nespecially in the elderly and in those receiving high doses.\nKey words: cotrimoxazole, SIADH, nocardiosis\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 352–355\nIntroduction\nPulmonary nocardiosis, previously thought \nof as a disease that occurs mainly in the immu-\nnocompromised population, has become increas-\ningly reported in individuals with structural \nlung diseases [1, 2]. Cotrimoxazole is the drug of \nchoice for the treatment of nocardiosis. Although \nwidely considered to be a drug with a decent \nsafety profile, it has its own major and minor \nadverse effects [3, 4]. SIADH is a rare but serious \ncomplication associated with Cotrimoxazole ther-\napy. Its occurrence is more frequently observed \nthan previously recorded. SIADH is a disorder \ncaused by the inability to suppress secretion of \nanti-diuretic hormone. There is impairment of \nwater excretion and if water intake is in excess \nof urine output, water retention occurs leading to \nhyponatremia [5, 6]. The risk appears to be high-\nest in the elderly population and is essentially \ndose-dependent [5, 7].\nCase history\nA 62-year-old male non-smoker was admitted \ndue to complaints of acute worsening of breathless-\nness, fever, and cough with expectoration that had \nbeen present for 5 days. The fever was intermittent \nand high grade, and was associated with chills and \nrigor. Cough was productive with copious yellow-\nish non-foul-smelling sputum. He had a history of \nsputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis \nsix years ago for which he received antitubercular \ntherapy. He had developed obstructive airway dis-\nease as a sequela of pulmonary tuberculosis which \nwas confirmed by spirometry. He was treated with \ninhaled bronchodilators for five years.\nOn admission he was severely ill, febrile (oral \ntemperature 38.9°C), tachypneic, tachycardic, \nand normotensive with an oxygen saturation of \n82% on room air. \nRespiratory system examination revealed \nbilateral diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi. \nNishant Chauhan et al., Cotrimoxazole-induced SIADH\n353\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nOther systemic examinations were unremarkable.\nOn evaluation, he had neutrophilic leuko-\ncytosis. The total count was 21,010 (89% neu-\ntrophils). Liver and renal function parameters \nwere normal. Other unordinary lab results were \ndocumented as follows: serum sodium on ad-\nmission was 134 mg/dL, the C-reactive protein \nlevel was 190 mg/L, and serum procalcitonin \nwas 2.86 ng/mL. Chest X-ray showed bilateral \nnon-homogenous opacities with haziness over \nthe right upper zone (Figure 1).\nHe was started on empirical antibiotic ther-\napy with IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam (4.5 g 4 ×/ \n/diem) and oral Azithromycin (500mg 1 ×/diem). \nOxygen supplementation, nebulized bronchodila-\ntors, and other supportive therapy was provided. \nOn day four, in view of inadequate clinical im-\nprovement, a contrast-enhanced computed tomo-\ngram of the thorax was completed which showed \nground-glass opacities over the right upper lobe \nwith multiple bilateral patchy areas of consolida-\ntion and centrilobular nodules (Figure 2).\nFlexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was planned \nand completed under continuous oxygen supple-\nmentation by nasal cannula with a target oxygen \nsaturation of 90%. It showed purulent secretions \nfrom the right lobar and segmental bronchi. Bron-\nchial anatomy was normal and aerobic cultures \nof bronchial secretions, Ziehl Nielsen staining, \nGram-staining, Mycobacterium culture were sent. \nThere was no bronchoscopy-related complication. \nAn aerobic culture of bronchial fluids showed \ngrowth of Nocardia (the specific species were \nnot identified). Modified acid-fast bacilli (AFB) \nstain after bronchial lavage showed filamentous \nbranched acid-fast positive bacilli. Fungal stain \nand culture were negative. Mycobacterium cul-\nture was negative at the end of the required 42-day \nculture period.\nAs part of the Nocardia pneumonia treat-\nment regimen, the patient was started on oral \nCotrimoxazole at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight. \nAfter 3 days of treatment, the patient developed \nasymptomatic hyponatremia. Sodium levels had \nfallen from 134 mEq/L to 129 mEq/L, and then \nsubsequently to 105mEq/L. Even at this point, \nhe did not have any symptoms. Causes of this \nelectrolyte imbalance were investigated. Thy-\nroid function tests were done and serum cortisol \nwas measured and both results were found to \nbe normal. A CT scan of the brain was normal. \nAfter ruling out other causes, the cause of the \nhyponatremia was suspected to be Cotrimoxaz-\nole-induced SIADH (serum sodium 105 mEq/L, \nurine osmolality 468 mOsm/kg, serum osmolality \n250 mOsm/kg, and urine sodium 82 mmol/L). Flu-\nid restriction was initiated, and hypertonic saline \nwas administered. Cotrimoxazole was stopped \nand serum sodium levels returned to normal after \ncontinuing the above measures.\nSince the treatment of Nocardia involves \nthe use of long-term antibiotics, we decided to \nre-introduce Cotrimoxazole to see if it was the \ncause of the hyponatremia. On reintroduction \nof Cotrimoxazole, a fall in serum sodium levels \nwas observed by day 3 (a level of 110 mEq/L). As \na result, Cotrimoxazole was stopped and the pa-\ntient was started on IV Amoxycillin-clavulanate \n(1.2 g, 3 ×/diem) as an alternative regimen. He \nreceived parenteral antibiotics for 10 days. There \nwas a serial fall in total WBC count to 14,320, and \nserum procalcitonin had fallen from an initial \n2.86 ng/mL to 0.11 ng/mL. The patient’s clinical \ncondition improved gradually and he was weaned \noff oxygen therapy while continuing therapy \nwith Amoxycillin-clavulanate (625 mg 3×/diem) \nwhich was now administered orally. He was \ndischarged in a stable condition and advised to \ncontinue oral Amoxycillin-clavulanate therapy at \na dose 625 mg thrice daily for a duration of three \nmonths. Subsequent chest radiographs taken on \nfollow up after 40 days of therapy showed signifi-\ncant clearance of radiological opacities (Figure 3). \nFigure 1. Chest radiograph PA view showing multiple bilateral air \nspace opacities and bilateral flattened diaphragms\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 352–355\n354\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nDiscussion\nNocardiosis is classically known to be an \nopportunistic infection associated with impaired \nimmunity, particularly cell-mediated immunity. \nHowever, up to one-third of patients have been \nfound to be immunocompetent [2, 8]. \nRisk factors for Nocardiosis include infec-\ntion with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, \ntransplants, cancers, rheumatic diseases, diabe-\ntes mellitus, steroid abuse, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease, and poor socio-economic \nconditions [8, 9].\nPulmonary involvement is the most common \npresentation of nocardiosis. Symptom onset \nmay be acute, sub-acute or chronic and includes \ncough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, fever, \nweight loss, and fatigue [2, 10]. Lobar consolida-\ntion is the most common radiographic presenta-\ntion, followed by nodules/reticulations [10].\nAlthough Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole is \nthe mainstay of treatment, the final drug regimen \nis decided on the basis of antimicrobial sensitiv-\nity, the severity of the disease process, and the \norgan of involvement [2, 10]. \nCotrimoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic \nwhich contains Trimethoprim and Sulfamethox-\nazole. Trimethoprim is a heterocyclic weak base \nand is related in structure to the potassium-spar-\ning diuretics amiloride and triamterene which \nact by blocking sodium reabsorption at the eNaC \n(epithelial sodium channel) in the distal nephron \n[10]. High doses of TMP has been shown to act \nas epithelial sodium channel inhibitors in the \ndistal tubule.\nSIADH can be caused by a variety of pul-\nmonary and extra-pulmonary infections/malig-\nnancies, as well as by a range of medications [7]. \nSIADH is a common cause of hyponatremia. In \na retrospective cohort study by Tsapepas et al, the \nincidence of hyponatremia was found to be 72.3% \namong those on high dose therapy with Cotrimox-\nazole [4]. Severe hyponatremia and SIADH is rare \nand described in only a few case-reports [11, 12].\nIn describing hyponatremia and its treatment, \nthe cerebral effects are worth mentioning. The rate \nof sodium correction in hyponatremia of acute \nonset should be < 10mEq/L in the first 24 hours \nand < 8mEq/L for any 24-hour period thereafter. \nEffective serum osmolality is determined by serum \nsodium concentration. Hypotonic hyponatremia, \nif acute and severe, can lead to the entry of wa-\nter into brain cells and ultimately, to cerebral \nedema [13, 14]. The brain adapts to such a level \nof hypotonicity by losing intracellular solutes, \nprincipally potassium and organic solutes called \nosmolytes. Hyponatremia, which develops within \ntwo or three days, is less likely to be complicated \nby cerebral edema because of this brain adapta-\ntion. Once the adaptation is complete, the rate of \ncorrection of hyponatremia is important. Overt \nrapid correction of hyponatremia can induce \nOsmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS) [13]. \nHowever, rapid correction in acute and severe \nhyponatremia does not induce ODS because the \ncerebral adaptation is still in its early stage [14].\nIn our case, the patient’s thyroid and adrenal \nfunction, as well as brain imaging, were normal. \nFigure 2. Contrast-enhanced tomogram of the thorax showing bilateral \nupper lobe ground-glass opacities and right upper lobe consolidation\nFigure 3. Chest radiograph showing clearance of previously noted \nopacities during follow-up\nNishant Chauhan et al., Cotrimoxazole-induced SIADH\n355\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nIn view of no other plausible explanation for the \nhyponatremia, we considered Cotrimoxazole as \nthe likely causative agent.\n The presence of low \nserum osmolality, high urine osmolality, and high \nurinary sodium in the absence of hypothyroidism \nand peripheral signs of hypovolemia pointed \ntowards a potential iatrogenic cause. Once the \nhyponatremia was resolved with the cessation \nof Cotrimoxazole, and subsequently reappeared \nwhen therapy was re-started, the diagnosis of \nCotrimoxazole induced-SIADH was evident.\nConclusion\nThis case report presents a rare but poten-\ntially fatal complication associated with Cotri-\nmoxazole therapy: SIADH. Probable risk factors \nfor this in our case are advanced age and a high \ndose of Cotrimoxazole. A high index of suspicion \nand close monitoring of serum electrolytes is \nnecessary, especially in older patients.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences: \n1.\t Rivière F, Billhot M, Soler C, et al.

Treadmill ergometry (VO2peak), \nspirometry (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, peak flow), and bone mineral density testing were performed prior to every 3 months.\nResults: After one year of supervised aerobic exercise training we saw dramatic increases in the patient’s VO2max (20%), FEV1 \n(9.5%), FEV1/FVC (9.1%) and peak flow (47%). \nConclusions: The results from this study indicate that supervised exercise training can improve exercise tolerance and pulmonary \nfunction in a patient with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Further research is needed, including longitudinal studies with larger sample \nsizes, to determine long-term effects and consistency of these findings. Aerobic exercise may offer a viable alternative or com-\npliment to pharmacological interventions in the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. We show that high-intensity exercise \ntraining can markedly and safely improve pulmonary function in a patient with TSC-LAM. While we did not record quality of life \nor mood states, our patient did report improved self-confidence as well as enhanced mood.\nKey words: tuberous sclerosis, exercise, lymphangioleiomyomatosis\nAdv Respir Med. 2020; 88: 356–359\nIntroduction\nApproval was obtained from the Committee \nfor Protection of Human Subjects at the Universi-\nty of Houston and the Institutional Review Board \nat the University of Texas Health Science Center \n(UTHSC) and at the University of Central Arkan-\nsas. Written informed consent was obtained from \nour patient prior to data collection. A 29-year-old \nfemale with tuberous sclerosis complex lymphan-\ngioleiomyomatosis (TSC-LAM; TSC diagnosed in \n1988, age 5; LAM in 2004, age 21) with a history \nof related complications (more than twenty pneu-\nmothoraces, resulting in bilateral pleurodesis \nand pleurectomy; angiomyolipomas resulting in \npartial nephrecotmy) was referred from the UTH-\nSC LAM Clinic by her LAM specialist. Her last \npneumothorax was approximately five years prior \nto her inclusion in this trial (age 23), when she re-\nceived her bilateral pleurectomy/pleurodesis. The \npsychological state of the patient was motivated \nbut she was lacking in confidence in her ability \nto perform even moderate exercise (e.g., more \nthan walking at a slow pace on a treadmill for \nmore than a few minutes). The patient was taking \nsirolimus for 3 years, switching to afinitor 4 years \nago due to attenuation (sirolimus benefits were \nplateauing) of sirolimus on disease. The patient \ndid not have any brain lesions, nor had she ever \nexperienced any episodes of epilepsy. \nMaterial and methods\nPulmonary function tests (PFTs), a graded ex-\nercise test (GXT), and bone mineral density (BMD) \nwere assessed prior to beginning exercise training \nThomas William Lowder, Exercise in TSC-LAM\n357\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\n(pre) and every three months. Twice weekly the \npatient reported for supervised exercise training \n(60 min/session), consisting of high-intensity aer-\nobic (primarily treadmill/track running/sprinting) \nand resistance training. Patient performed a GXT \nto volitional fatigue to determine VO2max using \na Woodway Desmo treadmill (Waukesha, WI, USA) \nand a Quark CPET metabolic cart (Cosmed, Rome, \nItaly). PFTs were assessed using the Quark CPET \nmetabolic cart. A Discovery QDR-4500 for Win-\ndows (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) dual X-ray \nabsorptiometry (DXA) scanner was used to assess \nBMD. Tests were completed in room air without \nbronchodilator. PFTs prior to baseline (-60 months, \n-18 months) were taken from patient records.\nOur patient demonstrated marked improve-\nments in VO2max (Figure 1A), FEV1 (forced expira-\ntory volume in 1 second) and FEV1/FVC (forced \nvital capacity) % (Figure 1B and 1C), and peak \nflow (Figure 1D). Whole body and spine BMD \nalso slightly improved or remained high despite \nalready-high levels (Table 1). Forced vital capacity \nremained steady from baseline (Table 1). Patient \nmaintained bodyweight (61.4–64 kg) and body \nfat (21.9–27.2%) pre to post. Peak flow improved \nby 47%; relative and absolute VO2max improved \nby 20% and 23.4%, respectively. We do not have \npulmonary function tests for the patient prior to \nher initial use of either sirolimus or following \ncessation of the drug. The baseline (-60 months) \nwere taken approximately one year prior to the \npatient switching to Afinitor and the -18 months \nmeasures were the most recent PFT measures \ntaken prior to her being seen in our laboratory. \nDiscussion\nLymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare, multi-\nsystem disease affecting women of child-bearing \nage almost exclusively and can occur sporadically \nor as a manifestation of TSC-LAM [1]; indeed, \nLAM occurs in at least 40% of women with TSC \n[2]. Severe cases can lead to respiratory failure. \nSpontaneous pneumothoraces are common and \nFigure 1. Oxygen uptake (VO2max) and pulmonary function tests\nAdvances in Respiratory Medicine 2020, vol. 88, no. 4, pages 356–359\n358\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nare often the primary event leading to diagnosis \nand in most cases clinical events existed prior to \ndiagnosis with one-third of patients exhibiting \nnormal spirometry and obstruction evident in \n57% of patients [3]. Despite great advances in \ndiagnosis and patient management over the past \ntwo decades, treatment options are limited. As \nsuch, lifestyle choices and treatment options \nshould be made as early as possible [2].\nSirolimus targets the mammalian target of \nrapamycin (mTOR) pathway and has been tre-\nmendously effective in improving pulmonary \nfunction in the majority of patients with LAM \n[4]. However, once treatment is stopped im-\nprovement disappears, and sirolimus appears to \nhave a much greater effect in reducing extrapul-\nmonary masses rather than pulmonary cysts [5]. \nFurther, angiomyolipomas increase once therapy \nis stopped [6] and LAM is recurrent following \nlung transplant [7]. FEV1 is considered the most \nclinically-relevant marker in determining disease \nseverity [8]; patients with FEV1 < 30% are often \nplaced on transplant list. Improved FEV1 could \ntranslate into reduced disease severity, potentially \nincreasing time-to-transplant. A 100 mL increase \nin FEV1 has been shown to be clinically important \nin COPD as this can be perceived by patients [9], \nand Westwood determined that a 100 mL increase \nin FEV1 was associated with improved health \nstatus [10]. Our patient exhibited an elevated and \nsustained FEV1 of 230 mL (10% increase, Table 1) \nbeginning at 6 months. Exercise tolerance may be \nas clinically relevant as FEV1 [11], as individuals \nable to perform even moderate physical activity \nwould likely have a much-improved quality of \nlife. Here we show an improvement in pulmonary \nfunction and exercise tolerance (VO2). \nUsing exercise to treat women with LAM or \nTSC-LAM is novel. To date, only one study has \nexamined the role of exercise in women with LAM \n[12]. While that study used exercise, only mod-\nerate exercise training was prescribed, and only \n12 weeks (3 months) of exercise training was un-\ndertaken. Here we report on increased pulmonary \nfunction in a 29-year-old female with TSC-LAM \nfollowing one year of intense exercise training. \nFEV1 and peak flow improved at three and six \nmonths, with large increases after nine and twelve \nmonths (Figure 1A, D). VO2 improved steadily, \npeaking at 6 months and remaining elevated. No \ndecline in pulmonary function was seen after one \nyear, unlike sirolimus [4]. These remarkable im-\nprovements demonstrate the potential of exercise \nto improve lung function in women with LAM. \nIncreases were much more dramatic 9–12 months \nthan 3–6 months after beginning the exercise inter-\nvention, with levels continuing to rise at one year. \nOur patient is continuing to exercise to determine \nif these measures remain elevated past one year. \nThis is the first study in the literature that demon-\nstrates the use of high-intensity exercise to treat \nLAM. This presents the possibility of extending \ntime-to-transplant with minimal, non-invasive \nintervention. As VO2 is correlated with disease \nseverity [11], improved VO2 translates clinically \nand physiologically for patients with LAM.\nWe are presently preparing a manuscript \nexamining a larger (n = 8) group of LAM (seven \nsporadic LAM and one TSC-LAM) patients exam-\nining the positive benefits of exercise training on \npulmonary function and bone mineral density at \n3, 6, 9, and 12 month intervals. While the results \nof that study demonstrated marked improve-\nments, this patient exhibited even greater results \nfollowing high-intensity (as opposed to moderate- \nto moderately-high intensity) exercise training. \nAlthough quite deconditioned, the patient in \nthis present study was remarkably healthy aside \nTable 1.

Her breathlessness \nwas greater while she played basketball at school and was associated with a cough which was dry in nature. \nShe denied any fever, weight loss, previous disease, or any menstrual irregularities. Her physical examina-\ntion revealed that she was apyrexial, normotensive, and eupnoeic. Her thyroid, lymph node, abdominal, and \nper-vaginal examinations were normal apart from decreased breath sounds in her right side. A chest X-ray \nrevealed right-sided homogenous opacity with regular margins widening the cardiac shadow. There was no \nprevious radiology for comparison. The suspicion of massive loculated effusion or some congenital cyst was \nmade. USG of the chest showed the anechoic area with septations with isoechoic area making the possibility \nof loculated effusion or empyema more likely. Considering the patient’s trivial symptoms and non-toxic nature \nwhich would have not been there in case of empyema, contrast-enhanced computerised tomogram was done. \nCT scan showed a large well-defined mass, which was low attenuating with focal areas of fat and calcification \nalong with areas of cystic degeneration. Trucut biopsy was suggestive of mature cystic teratoma. The patient \nunderwent open thoracotomy and enucleation of the tumour. Surgical and pathologic findings led to the dia-\ngnosis of a mature cystic teratoma with components of three germ layers. Gross examination showed a rounded \ntumour measuring 18 × 11.5 × 7.8 cm and  weighing 300 g. The tumour was predominantly cystic, with thin, \nsharply delineated wall filled with sebaceous material and hair which mimicked loculated septated effusion \non USG. Microscopically, the cyst wall was lined by the epidermis and some are lined by tall columnar with \nunderlying sebaceous glands and hair follicles. The walls of the cyst showed pilosebaceous units and eccrine \nglands lobules of mature adipose tissue, hyaline cartilage, brain tissue and nerve twigs (Figure 1).\nGerm cell tumours are the fourth most common mediastinal neoplasm, occurring almost always in the \nanterosuperior compartment. In this location, germ cell tumours are second only to thymomas and lymphomas. \nFive percent of germ cell tumours are extragonadal, the anterior mediastinum is the most common location \nfollowed by the retroperitoneum, pineal and suprasellar regions; and men are affected more often than women \n[1]. Microscopically, they are characterised by well-differentiated derivations from at least two of the three \ngerm cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Ectodermal elements may be represented by skin, \nteeth, and hair; mesodermal elements by bone, cartilage, and muscle; and endodermal elements by bronchial \nand gastrointestinal epithelium and pancreatic tissue. Cyst formation is typical, and at times they have raised \nprotuberance projecting into the cyst cavity known as Rokitansky Nodule [2].\nMost mediastinal teratomas like our case are asymptomatic or have trivial complaints unless they compress \nadjacent structures like the airways and vessels. Dull aching chest pain is often the most common presentation. \nAt times some patients present with coughing up hair, i.e. trichoptysis indicating communication between \nthe tracheobronchial tree and the teratoma. Physical examination is limited to chest dullness and diminished \nbreath sounds. While some individuals have a bulging deformity of the chest wall, a draining fistula between \nthe tumour and the skin, acanthosis nigricans, or superior vena cava obstruction [3].\nRadiologically, teratomas are round or lobulated anterior mediastinal mass that has sharp margins and \noccupies one side of the thorax. Calcification, ossification, or even teeth may even be visible on chest radio-\ngraphs. Chest CECT  is the imaging modality of choice. Mediastinal mature teratomas contain soft tissue in \nvirtually all cases followed by fluid in 88% and fat in 76%. All these elements are present in the same lesion \nGopal Chawla et al., Mediastinal germ cell tumour masquerading as loculated pleural effusion \n361\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\nFigure 1. A.

Its mortality is increased in people \nwith comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD) [1, 2]. There is in-\ncreased evidence that the massive release of pro-in-\nflammatory cytokines leading to the cytokine storm \nsyndrome shapes the evolution of COVID-19 and \nis responsible of the severity of COVID-19 in some \npatients [3]. A recent review argued that vitamin D \ndeficiency could have increased the COVID-19 out-\nbreak and suggested vitamin D supplementation \nas a preventive action [4]. In fact, many factors \nseem to be correlated both to low vitamin D levels \nand the importance of COVID-19 spreading and \nseverity. It is also important to highlight that the \nlockdown, implemented in many countries, pre-\nvents people to go out and then increases the risk \nof vitamin D deficiency.\nVitamin D receptor is widely present in differ-\nent tissues of the organism. Therefore, vitamin D \nis involved in multiple biological metabolisms. It \nwas proven to have immunomodulatory functions, \nand particularly suppresses pro-inflammatory cy-\ntokines [5]. Very few dietary sources are known to \ncontain significant quantities of vitamin D, such \nas cod liver oil, oily fish and fortified food in some \ncountries. This vitamin is mainly synthesized in \nthe skin when exposed to ultra-violet (UV) radia-\ntion. Its synthesis is thus influenced by different \nfactors such as the season, the time of the exposure \nduring the day and the latitude. The zenith angle \ninfluences vitamin D production by modulating \nthe path of UV radiation to the skin. That is why, \nlatitude affects vitamin D levels, and vitamin \nD can hardly be produced neither above (to the \nnorth) and below (to the south) 33° latitude during \nwinter months, nor in the early morning and late \nafternoon (approximately before 10 a.m. and after \n3 p.m.). Vitamin D status changes depending on \nthe period of the year. In fact, they reach their peak \nat the end of the summer, while the lowest levels \nare observed at the end of the winter. Besides, air \npollution absorbs UV and so reduces vitamin D \nsynthesis [6]. The facts that the outbreak is taking \nplace when vitamin D levels are at their lowest, \nthat the most affected countries by COVID-19 are \nnorthern countries and that polluted cities were \nmore hit [7] suggested that it could be linked to \nsun exposure and vitamin D. Different factors may \ninterfere with these variables such as the ability \nof the virus to resist to high temperatures as well \nas the effects of air pollution on health. It is still \nearly to conclude about the spreading and severity \nof the disease in southern countries which differ \nin the time of the beginning, the governmental \nmeasures, the strength of the health system, and \npossible genetic and social factors.\nVitamin D deficiency represents a common \npublic health issue in many countries world-\nwide. COPD patients are particularly at risk to \nhave low levels of vitamin D due to multiple risk \nfactors associated to the disease, such as aging, \nreduced outdoors activity, poor diet, and the use \nof corticosteroids [8]. COPD is more than just an \nairways disease. In fact, it may generate a systemic \nMalek Chaabouni et al., Vitamin D to prevent COVID-19 in COPD\n365\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\ninflammatory process responsible of second-\nary extra-pulmonary impairments. Although \nCOPD patients share certain risk factors that \nmay explain some of the comorbidities, such as \nsmoking history, physical inactivity and aging, \nother frequently observed comorbidities cannot \nbe easily attributed to them. There is increasing \nevidence that COPD is just a part from a chronic \ninflammation linking these comorbidities and \nexplaining why they develop together [9]. Vitamin \nD deficiency could sustain and aggravate the sys-\ntemic inflammation associated to COPD. Reports \nhave also shown that vitamin D deficiency was \nassociated to exacerbations and hospital admis-\nsions, as well as lung function [5]. That may be \nexplained by the immunomodulatory effects of \nvitamin D. Recent research showed that vitamin \nD supplementation significantly reduced COPD \nexacerbations [10]. These encouraging results are \na further argument to test this option. \nAlthough vitamin D deficiency was not \nproved to be neither a risk factor of COVID-19, \nnor a determinant of its severity, it represents \na preventive perspective that needs to be further \nstudied. Future studies should precise the rela-\ntion between stages of COPD and COVID-19, and \ntest the effectiveness of a preventive vitamin D \nsupplementation. \nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences:\n1.\t Wang L, He W, Yu X, et al.

The most commonly \nused CDSs are the analogic three-chamber pla-\nstic units, consisting respectively in a drainage, \na water seal and a suction chamber [1].\nThe three chambers are in communication \nand the water seal prevents the air returning to \nthe pleural space during inspiration. As a CDS \nis set up, the water seal is filled with standard \nsaline solution or water. If your choice is a wet \nCDS the suction column also has to be filled up \nto the desired level.\nThe dramatic outspread of coronavirus dise-\nase 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the manage-\nment of patients undergoing thoracic surgery and, \nconsequently, the habits of a Thoracic Surgery \nward and operating theatre. Unfortunately, CO-\nVID-19 transmission to patients and health care \nstaff is well reported [2]. We would like to arise \nconcerns about the chances of infection for both \nnurses and surgeons when using standard CDS \nin COVID-19 patients. \nThis is mainly for three reasons: firstly, in the \ncase of a broken or overturned CDS there could \nbe a direct contamination by fluids from the chest \ncavity. Secondly, we cannot exclude that aerosol \ntransmission occurs from within the CDS to the \nsurrounding atmosphere [3]. Finally, there can \nbe contamination while dealing with the suction \nsystem, because the CDS may be connected to \nthe external wall vacuum by a plastic tube. As \npreviously described, a CDS is a system of three \nplastic chambers and viable coronavirus has been \ndetected on plastic surfaces up to 72 hours after \napplication [4]. \nFor all these reasons the safety of a standard \nthree plastic chamber CDS in a COVID-19 patient \nhas to be questioned in its present form, without \nappropriate precautions. The best means of pro-\ntecting physicians and nurses from COVID-19 in-\nfection during daily ward activities shouldn’t \nbe the cleaning of the CDS. Once connected to \nthe chest tube(s) the CDS is placed on the floor \nand periodical cleaning with alcoholic solutions \n(e.g. twice a day) exposes the operators to further \ncontamination. \nA reasonable way to reduce the possibility \nof contamination is to substitute the fluids com-\nmonly used to fill the water-seal chamber (for \nboth dry and wet CDS) and the suction chamber \n(for the wet CDS only). We advocate the use of an \nalcohol-based solution (ethanol 62–71%) instead \nof water/saline solution to fill both the water-seal \nand suction chamber in order to minimize the risk \nof aerosol diffusion.\nEthanol-based solutions are found to be more \neffective in the prevention of further spread of \nCOVID-19 on inanimate surfaces if compared to \nchlorhexidine and other biocidal agents [5]. The \nsolution has to maintain the fluid properties of \nwater to ensure the correct functioning of the \nCDS. Finally, the risk of alcohol evaporation and \ndirect inhalation by the patient into the chest \nFabio Davoli et al., Three-chamber chest drain system in the covid-19 era\n367\nwww.journals.viamedica.pl\ncavity during inspiration is negated by the uni-\ndirectionality of the system. However, further \nstudies are needed to confirm our advice.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have nothing to disclose.\nReferences:\n1.\t Porcel JM.

Current data about the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking \non the clinical course of COVID-19 are still controversial. This study evaluated the prevalence and the \nprognosis of COPD patients and smokers in a cohort of 521 patients admitted to four intermediate \nRespiratory Intensive Care Units (Puglia, Italy) with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. \nThe prevalence of COPD and current smokers was 14% and 13%, respectively. COPD patients had \na higher 30-day all-cause mortality than non-COPD patients. Former smokers compared to never \nsmokers and current smokers had higher 30-day all-cause mortality. COPD patients and former \nsmokers had more comorbidities. This study described the prevalence and the outcomes of COPD \npatients and smokers in a homogenous cohort of COVID-19 patients. The study showed that the \nprevalence of COPD and current smokers was not high, suggesting that they were not at increased risk \nof getting the infection. However, when SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred, COPD patients and former \nsmokers were those with the highest all-cause mortality, which seemed to be mainly related to the \npresence of comorbidities and not to COPD and smoking itself.\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is an emerging health threat \nthat has been declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the Worth Health Organization (WHO)1. Coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) has a broad spectrum of manifestations ranging from subclinical infection to critical \nillness. The mild disease has symptoms similar to usual upper respiratory tract ­infections2,3. In contrast, COVID-\n19 pneumonia is characterized by evidence of signs and symptoms (fever, and/or asthenia, and/or persistent \ncough) of lower respiratory disease during clinical evaluation and by presence of non-specific radiological figures \nat chest imaging (reticulations, and/or ground-glass, and/or consolidative opacities, predominantly distributed \nbilaterally and peripherally). It may lead to acute respiratory failure and evolve to acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome, often requiring mechanical ­ventilation4,5.\nMultiple studies investigate risk factors associated with a worse prognosis in COVID-196,7. It has been noted \nthat SARS-CoV-2 infection more readily causes respiratory failure and death in the most susceptible patients and \nin patients with ­comorbidities8,9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic airway \ndisease characterized by an irreversible impairment of lung functionality. Intuitively, since COVID-19 mainly \naffects the respiratory system, COPD may have high prevalence in COVID-19 population and may worsen clini-\ncal outcomes of these ­patients10. However, surprisingly, many studies showed that COPD was underrepresented \namong the comorbidities of COVID-19 patients compared with other comorbidities or with the global burden \nof the ­disease11,12. At the same time, COPD patients with COVID-19 had more severe disease than non-COPD \n­patients13. Moreover, in June 2020 a WHO report warned that smoking could be a risk factor for the adverse \nprognosis of COVID-1914.\nOPEN\n1Respiratory Diseases Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, “Policlinico Riuniti” University Hospital, \nUniversity of Foggia, Foggia, Italy. 2Respiratory Diseases Unit, Cardio‑Thoracic Department, “Policlinico di Bari” \nUniversity Hospital, University of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Bari, Italy. 3Internal Medicine COVID Unit, “F.

A recent systematic review did not report smoking as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection but \nreported an increased risk of severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation or death in current ­smokers16. \nOn the other hand, another meta-analysis did not find an association between current smoking and the severity \nof the ­disease17. Therefore, the impact of underlying COPD and smoking on patients’ susceptibility and on the \nseverity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still uncertain and ­controversial18,19. In the present study, we hypothesized \nthat COPD and tobacco smoking may have a different impact on patients’ susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection \nand on the severity and clinical course of the disease. The primary aim was to analyse the prevalence of COPD \nand the prognosis of COPD patients in a selected and homogenous cohort of patients with acute respiratory \nfailure due to COVID-19-related pneumonia and admitted to intermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Units \n(RICUs), a model of care designed for monitoring and treating respiratory patients whose illness is at a level of \nseverity that is intermediate between that which requires intensive care unit (ICU) facilities and that which can \nbe managed on a conventional ­ward20,21. The secondary aim was to examine the prevalence of smokers and the \nassociation of tobacco smoking with sociodemographic and clinical features during the clinical course of these \nhospitalized patients.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design. \nThis is a retrospective, observational and multicentric study conducted in four intermediate \nRICUs of the Puglia region in Southern Italy (Policlinico Riuniti of Foggia, Policlinico of Bari, “F. Miulli” Hos-\npital of Acquaviva delle Fonti and “A. Perrino” Hospital of Brindisi). We obtained medical records and compiled \ndata from hospitalized adult inpatients affected by COVID-19 related pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, \nthat were managed from March 5th to May 31st, 2020. A total of 521 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 \npneumonia, confirmed by RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swab and by chest X-ray or chest CT performed in \nEmergency Rooms, were included in the study. At admission, all patients underwent to routine blood examina-\ntion, assessing the following laboratory parameters: complete blood count, coagulation profile with D-dimers, \nserum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, albumin, cardiac enzymes and iron), inflammatory \nmarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total \nlymphocytes and T‐lymphocytes count, and vitamin D levels. The anamnesis, obtained both directly from the \npatients (if clinical conditions allowed) or from the relatives and/or clinical records, was aimed to ascertain smok-\ning habits, the coexistence of respiratory diseases (such as asthma and COPD) and other comorbidities (diabetes \nmellitus, neurological diseases, kidney diseases, heart diseases, and cancer history). We used a semi-structured \nquestionnaire in all the sites involved, investigating the same comorbidities. The anamnesis was also aimed at \nidentifying patients on Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) or Long-term Non Invasive Ventilation (LTNIV) \nin order to assess the presence of chronic respiratory failure at baseline. Age-corrected Charlson Comorbidity \nIndex (CCI) was calculated. The required ventilatory support and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to frac-\ntional inspired oxygen ratio ­(PaO2/FiO2) ratio of each patient at admission were recorded. Since deaths occurred \nin hospital, the death data was obtained from the hospital databases. Data on 30 day-survival were also collected. \nOn the basis of anamnestic data, the enrolled subjects were then divided into 5 groups to assess differences: (1) \nCurrent smokers with COPD, (2) Former smokers with COPD, (3) Current smokers without COPD, (4) Former \nsmokers without COPD and (5) Never smokers. In the former smokers groups, we included those who had a his-\ntory of smoking tobacco cigarettes in the past for at least 1 year and had stopped smoking for at least 3 months.\nAll patients’ data were collected in the context of routine clinical care, and written informed consent was \nsigned at admission according to hospital policy. Ethical Committee “Area 1 dell’Azienda Ospedaliero-Univer-\nsitaria, Ospedale Riuniti” of Foggia approved this study. The experiment was performed in accordance with \nrelevant guidelines and regulations.\nStatistical analysis. \nContinuous variables are presented as arithmetic mean ± standard deviation (SD), \nwhile categorical variables as counts (N) and percentage (%). Student T-test and ANOVA (with Turkey post-\nHoc analysis) were used for comparing continuous data. Chi-square test (χ2) was used to assess the relationship \nbetween categorical variables. The Kaplan–Meier method with hazard ratio (HR) was applied to detect differ-\nences in survival between the groups. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate adjusted HRs with \n95% confidence intervals (CIs) and to assess the influence of age, investigated comorbidities, CCI, and smoking \nhabits. The cut off of the CCI was identified by a receiving operator curve (ROC) analysis, and a value greater \nthan or equal to 4 was found to be the one with greater specificity (63%) and sensitivity (85%). A p value of < 0.05 \nwas considered to be significant.\nResults\nA total of 521 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of whole population are shown in \nTable 1. Data on smoking habits was available in 507 patients. According to a history of COPD and smoking, \npatients were divided into 5 groups (Table 2).\nCOPD patients were 72 (14%) and most of them were current or former smokers (97.2% of current and for-\nmer smokers vs. 2.8% of never smokers). Current smokers with COPD were mainly males (85%), while in the \ngroup of former smokers with COPD, male and female patients were similarly represented. Mean age of COPD \npatients was 78.150 ± 13.541. Main comorbidities were kidney diseases (44%), heart diseases (36%), history of \ncancer (25%), neurological diseases (18%) and diabetes mellitus (15%).

Former smokers had also a significantly higher CCI than \ncurrent and never smokers (mean CCI of former smokers: 4.16 ± 2.41; mean CCI of never smokers: 3.07 ± 2.13; \nmean CCI of current smokers: 2.64 ± 2.44; p = 0.0001).\nData on the ventilatory support required at admission were available only for 256 COVID-19 patients \n(Table 3). In this regard, the COPD group was significantly associated with the need to use mechanical ventila-\ntion in bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) mode [37 (16.97%) non-COPD patients vs. 15 (39.47%) of COPD \npatients underwent BPAP mode; p = 0.001].\nThe univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis of the 30-day relative risk of all-cause mortality on the whole \npopulation showed that age ≥ 65 years, smoking habits, CCI ≥ 4 and the presence of the different comorbidities \ninvestigated (except of history of cancer) increased all-cause mortality. However, after multivariate analysis, only \nage, smoking habits and some comorbidities (heart and neurological diseases) confirmed to be the greater risk \nfactors of all-cause mortality, but not COPD (smoking habits: HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.34–2.11; age ≥ 65 years: HR: \nFigure 1.   Kaplan–Meier plot of the probability of survival in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in four \nintermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Units according to the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD).\n5\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports |        (2021) 11:19251  | \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98749-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3.48, 95% CI: 2.26–5.37; neurological diseases: HR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.56–3.60; heart diseases: HR: 1.75, 95% CI: \n1.16–2.64)] (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this retrospective observational multicentre study was the first study that described \nthe prevalence of COPD and the prognosis of COPD patients in a selected and homogeneous cohort of patients \nadmitted to intermediate RICUs with COVID-19-related pneumonia. The present study also described the \nprevalence of smokers and the association of tobacco smoking with sociodemographic and clinical features \nduring the clinical course of these hospitalized patients.\nOne of the most notable findings in our study was the higher prevalence of COPD (14%) in COVID-19 \npopulation compared with previous reports. In this regard, Attaway and colleagues showed that in a COVID-\n19 symptomatic population of 15.586 patients, there were no significant differences in the rate of SARS-COv-2 \npositivity between COPD and non-COPD ­patients22. However, the study itself showed a higher prevalence of \nCOPD patients that required hospitalization (48.2% of COPD population vs. 26.5% of non-COPD population)22. \nOther studies reported a COPD prevalence of 2% in COVID-19 ­patients23. Emami and colleagues showed a \nCOPD incidence of 0.95% in hospitalized COVID-19 ­patients24. The Spain registry of hospitalized patients with \nCOVID-19 showed a relatively low COPD incidence of 7.7%25. Our previous study conducted on 97 hospitalized \nCOVID-19 patients also showed a low percentage of respiratory comorbidities (8.3%) and therefore of ­COPD12. \nTo date, only the review article of Leung and colleagues has suggested an extremely variable prevalence (from 1.2 \nto 38%) of COVID-19 patients with COPD, which is the closest to the present ­finding26. A possible explanation \nof our finding concerns the higher age of our population (mean age 67.18 ± 17.5 years). One another possible \nexplaining hypothesis is that reduced use of drugs for respiratory diseases, such as inhaled corticosteroids or \nbronchodilators, might have favoured the infection. In fact, corticosteroids could represent a protective factor \nFigure 2.   Kaplan–Meier plot of the probability of survival in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in four \nintermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Units according to smoking habits.\nTable 3.   Differences in ventilatory support of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in four intermediate \nRespiratory Intensive Care Units (RICUs) according to the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD) (N = 256).

Another possible hypothesis concerns the greater disease severity of our population, with \npatients with COVID-19-related pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. COVID-19 patients with COPD, \nbeing at greater risk of the severe forms of the disease, could be more frequent in intermediate RICUs. Finally, \nsince our definition of COPD was based only on clinical history and not on spirometric values, this might have \nled to COPD overdiagnosis.\nWhether COPD could represent a risk factor for negative prognosis in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. \nHowever, when we talk about evidence in this area, we must consider that the race to publish, especially in the \nfirst phase of the pandemic, may have led to publication of studies with a lot of methodological biases (e.g., poor \nstatistical analysis, non-standardized data collection methods, non-homogeneous populations, too small simple \nsizes, unadjusted prevalence data) and to erroneous conclusions, which may be responsible for current contro-\nversies. In our study, COPD was associated to a major requirement of non-invasive ventilation in BPAP mode \n(16.97% of non-COPD patients vs. 39.47% of COPD patients underwent BPAP mode; p = 0.001) and to a higher \n30-day all-cause mortality (non-COPD patients: 21% vs. COPD patients: 52%; p = 0.0001). These findings are in \nagreement with those of Attaway and colleagues showing that higher rates of ICU admission [adjusted odds ratio \n(OR): 1.20) and invasive mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR: 1.49) were observed in COPD patients compared \nwith non-COPD patients in a COVID-19 ­population22. Guan and colleagues described similar findings, as they \nshowed that COPD patients were more likely to experience ICU admission, invasive ventilation, and ­death8. \nTaken together, these data confirmed that COPD could be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. But, how can COPD \nbe responsible for more severe forms of COVID-19? An intriguing possibility concerns the ACE-2 enzyme, which \nis essential for the virus to gain entry into the organism and it is overexpressed in the lower respiratory tract of \nCOPD patients, favouring the severity of the ­disease27. Another hypothetical explanation is the alteration of the \nrenin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in COPD patients, which could lead to pulmonary edema during SARS-\nCoV-2 ­infection28. The presence of patients with severe forms of COPD at baseline might be a further explana-\ntion. In particular, in patients with severe COPD without COVID-19 the presence of chronic respiratory failure \nand, therefore, the use of LTOT, is associated with negative consequences which might also be responsible for \nthe poor prognosis of patients with severe COPD and COVID-1929,30. However in our population only 2 (2.7%) \nCOPD patients with COVID-19 had a history of LTOT/chronic respiratory failure, not explaining the worst \nprognosis of these patients. By contrast, in the present study, the higher age and the presence of comorbidities \nin COPD patients may explain the greater severity of their disease. In fact, while the univariate analysis on our \nsample showed that age, smoking, individual comorbidities and CCI ≥ 4 increase the 30-day relative risk of all-\ncause mortality, the multivariate analysis revealed that it was not COPD itself the cause of the greater severity \nof COVID 19, but are the higher age, the smoking habits, and the presence of other comorbidities (in particular \ncardiovascular and neurological ones). Since CCI is an index that includes both age and comorbidities, it could \nrepresent a valid tool for predicting the prognosis of these patients. These findings are in agreement with those of \nGómez Antúnez and colleagues obtained from a study conducted on 10,420 ­patients13. In particular, the associa-\ntion between multimorbidity and negative prognosis of COPD patients had already been widely emphasized by \nAlmagro and colleagues in the field of COPD exacerbation. Their most recent studies suggested that 3-month \nmortality in hospitalized COPD patients was correlated to a higher ­CCI31,32. Therefore, the increased presence \nof multimorbidity may be responsible for the worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients affected by COPD.\nAnother important point of discussion of the present study was to understand whether current smokers are \nmore prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since several studies in the past have shown that smokers are \npredisposed to severe respiratory infections, it would be logical to expect a high prevalence of current smokers \nin hospitalized COVID-19 ­patients33. Oppositely, in our population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 \npneumonia, we found a prevalence of current smokers of 13%, which is low if compared with the 20.3% preva-\nlence of smokers in the 60–64 age class and with the 14.4% prevalence in the 65–74 age class of the general Italian \nTable 4.   Univariate Cox proportional hazard model and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model of the \n30-day relative risk of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in four intermediate Respiratory \nIntensive Care Units (RICUs).

This surprising and paradoxical finding is in line with most similar studies. In particular, a Chinese \nanalysis conducted on hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a low prevalence of smokers (6.5%) compared \nto that of the general Chinese ­population35. Miyara and colleagues revealed a low incidence of current smokers \neven in a COVID-19 French ­population36. On the contrary, Guan and colleagues found a higher prevalence of \ncurrent smokers in severe forms of the disease than in milder ones, suggesting that the prevalence may vary \ndepending on the severity of the examined ­population6. In this regard, we would like to point out that, although \nour population was mostly made up of severe patients with acute respiratory failure, the prevalence of current \nsmokers remained low. Also Cumming and colleagues reported a low prevalence of smokers in critically ill \npatients with COVID-1937. The low rate of smokers observed in COVID-19 patients suggests that smokers are \nless prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection and that smoking habit has a “protective” effect. Several mecha-\nnisms may explain how this \"smoker’s paradox\" may be ­possible38,39. A possible mechanism concerns the nitric \noxide produced during smoking, which inhibits the replication of the virus and its entry into cells. Another \nexplanation applies the reduced expression of ACE-2 in smokers, which could reduce the risk of attachment \nof the virus to upper respiratory tract cells and the consequent ­infection19. However, the reduced expression of \nACE-2 itself may be harmful, as it exposes the smoker to a greater risk of local inflammation, vasoconstriction \nand thrombosis worsening his ­outcome19.\nIn fact, about the link between smoking and clinical outcomes of COVID-19, a systematic review concluded \nthat smoking was associated with disease progression and increased adverse outcomes in COVID-1916. Similar \nfindings derived from a very large study of the UK general population, where smoking was significantly associated \nwith increased COVID-19 mortality after age and sex adjustment (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12–1.40). However, after \nadjustment for multiple additional covariates, the same study found that smoking was associated with a reduced \nrisk for COVID-19 mortality (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79–0.99)40. Moreover, other studies in particular analysed the \nrelative risk of current smokers. Lippi and Henry’s meta-analysis demonstrated no significant association between \ncurrent smoking and COVID-19 severity (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 0.41–6.92; p = 0.254)17. On the other hand, some \nreviews have highlighted an increased mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in current ­smokers15. Due \nto these controversies, different mechanisms by which smoking could exert a protective or harmful action on \nthe clinical course of COVID-19 have been proposed. A possible protective mechanism of smoking relates to the \ninhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines production by nicotine, protecting against cytokine-storm syndrome. \nAnother theory concerns the continuous suppression of these systemic cytokines in smokers, who may adapt \ntheir immune response by becoming more tolerant and less reactive to continuous inflammatory stimuli than \npatients who have never smoked. However, smokers have a higher prevalence of comorbidities, that are known \nto have an independent negative impact on the clinical course of COVID-1919. A very important and innovative \nfinding of the present study was that, among smokers, former smokers were those with higher mortality. Since \nformer smokers had higher multimorbidity than never smokers and current smokers, and since the multivariate \nanalysis showed comorbidities like neurological and cardiovascular ones among the risk factors for mortality, \nwe can hypothesize that it was not smoking itself the responsible for the worst prognosis of smokers, but the \ncomorbidities related to its chronic exposure.\nThe present study had some limitations. Firstly, since patients were often critically ill at admission, pulmo-\nnary function tests could not be performed. Therefore, the diagnosis of COPD was based on purely anamnestic \ndata. Secondly, we analysed data basing on what was available in the hospital databases, but we recognized there \nwere some information not captured by them, including knowledge about existing medications, through which \nwe would have confirmed or not the diagnosis of COPD. Furthermore, we did not have cause-specific data on \nmortality. Moreover, given that the present study analyzed outcomes from March 5th to May 31st 2020, therefore \nbefore corticosteroids were routinely used, the lack of this medication in the first phase of the pandemic may have \ninfluenced all-cause mortality in our hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Finally, we did not have a cumulative effect \nof smoking over time, as measured by pack-years. In fact some studies have suggested that the cumulative expo-\nsure to cigarette smoking was an independent risk factor for hospital admission and death from COVID-1941.\nConclusions\nBased on our study findings, in a selected and homogeneous cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the \nprevalence of COPD was not high, suggesting that they were not at increased risk of getting the infection. How-\never, when SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in COPD patients, they had a higher all-cause mortality and a worse \nprognosis than non-COPD patients. The present study also showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was not common \nin current smokers and that, among smokers with COVID-19, former are those with the higher mortality. The \nworst outcomes of COPD patients and former smokers seemed to be mainly related to the comorbidities of these \nsubjects and not to COPD or smoking itself.\nReceived: 6 March 2021; Accepted: 23 August 2021\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Cucinotta, D. & Vanelli, M.

Conflicting reports exist regarding the \nimpact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). \nMETHODS \nWe carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health \nServices, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, and \nuntil May 16, 2020, over 145,000 adults underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory \nSyndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 3.3% had positive results. We performed a case-\ncontrol study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking \non infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to \nindividuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic \nregressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk \nof testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected \nwith COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring \nventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical \nconditions. \nRESULTS \nCurrent smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive \ncompared to the general population (19.4%, P<0.001), and to matched members tested negative \n(18.2%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for \ntesting positive OR=0.447 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.400-0.501). Among patients tested \npositive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. \nCONCLUSION \nThe risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This \nintriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be \ntargeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate. \n \n \nAll rights reserved.

Smokers are at greater risk for respiratory infections and \nwere expected to be at increased risk for Covid-19 as well1–3. Nevertheless, some reports appear to \nindicate that SARS-Cov-2 infection rate is not higher among smokers, and in several cohorts, the \ninfection rate among smokers was lower than in the general population4–7. There are also conflicting \ndata regarding clinical outcomes for smokers, and whether smoking is a risk factor for more severe \ndisease. A recent review published by the World Health Organization summarizes the conflicting \nresults of the studies available to date, and the lack of knowledge regarding the association between \nsmoking and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity8, highlighting the need for \npopulation-based studies to better understand the association. We report here the results of a large \npopulation study performed among adult members of Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest \nhealthcare provider in Israel. \nMethods \n \nStudy population and data collection \n \nClalit Health Services (CHS) provides comprehensive health services to over 3,000,000 adult \nmembers, and centrally manages electronic health records (EHR) including longitudinal records for \nover two decades. We anonymously collected selected variables from the EHR of patients who \nunderwent SARS-Cov-2 testing and had documented smoking status. Demographic variables, \nincluding age, gender, religious/ethnic group, were collected from the CHS database. Preexisting \nconditions were considered present when a corresponding documented diagnosis was present in the \nEHR. Patients were considered obese if their last documented body mass index (BMI) was above 30, \nor if they had a documented diagnosis of obesity. Follow-up, including hospitalization, condition \nseverity, the need for ventilation, and mortality were extracted from hospitalization records \ncollected by the Israeli Ministry of Health, up to June 3, 2020.  \nCHS institutional review board approved the project with a waiver of informed consent, approval \nnumber: COM-0046-20. \n \nStatistical analysis \n \nAll rights reserved.

Within this \npopulation, we defined a matched cohort where each patient positive for SARS-CoV-2 was matched \nto five patients tested negative of the same gender, age group (in five years intervals), and \nreligious/ethnic group. Conditional logistic-regression models were fitted for estimating the odds-\nratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of testing positive. A separate \nmodel, accounting for preexisting conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD), asthma, hypertension, obesity, reported arrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic \nheart disease, and malignancy, was fitted to account for conditions potentially influencing the risk \nassociated to smoking. \nAmong patients tested positive, we assessed the effect of smoking status on the risk of fatal or \nsevere disease requiring mechanical ventilation, by fitting multivariable logistic models accounting \nfor gender, age category, and religious/ethnic groups. A separate model was also performed to \nadjust for preexisting conditions. \nStatistical significance of differences observed between groups was assessed by the Chi-Square test \nfor categorical variables, and two tailed T-test for continuous variables. P-values below 0.05 were \nconsidered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.6 (R \nFoundation for statistical computing). \n \nResults \n \nThe flowchart of the cohort creation is presented as Figure 1. From the beginning of the outbreak \nand until May 16, 2020, 128,427 distinct CHS members with documented smoking status, underwent \nRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, 4,235 (3.3%) of whom tested positive. Among them, we found that \n9.8% were current smokers and 11.7% past smokers, while their corresponding rates within the \nadult population of CHS were 19.4% and 13.9% respectively (P<0.001).  \nThe characteristics of the matched cohort are shown in Table 1. The observed difference in smoking \nstatus is maintained in this cohort: current smoking prevalence is significantly lower among patients \nwho tested positive (9.8%) than among matched patients tested negative (18.2%). Table 2 presents \nthe regression results for testing positive for COVID-19 in the matched cohort. In column A, the \nresults of the conditional logistic regression are presented, adjusted only for age, gender, and \nreligion/ethnicity categories. In this model, current smoking was associated with significantly \nreduced OR 0.447, with a 95 % CI of 0.400-0.501. Interestingly, odds for testing positive were also \nAll rights reserved.

We assessed these associations in a separate model adjusted for preexisting \nconditions and found very similar results for smoking (column B). Interestingly, odds for positive \ntesting was increased for obese patients OR 1.172 (95% CI 1.084-1.267) but decreased in \nhypertensive patients OR 0.834 (95% CI 0.738-0.941), suggesting that among these two frequently \ncorrelated conditions, obesity is the one associated with increased infection rate. Odds ratio for \ninfection were also decreased for patients with asthma or malignancy, likely reflecting increased \nadherence to social distancing recommendations among these patients. \nTable 3 describes the odds ratio for the risk of severe or fatal disease among patients positive for \nSARS-CoV-2 in the cohort. Severe or fatal disease was very strongly associated with increasing age \nand with male gender, as evidenced by most studies to date. However, we found no statistically \nsignificant association between current or past smoking and disease severity, both in the model \nadjusted for baseline demographic characteristics (model A, adjusted for age, gender, and \nreligious/ethnic group), and in the model that accounted for preexisting conditions as well (model \nB); in the latter model, presence of ischemic heart disease or malignancy was  associated with \nsignificantly increased odds ratio for severe or fatal disease. \n \nDiscussion \n \nIn this large population of patients tested for COVID-19 infection, there appears to be significantly \nreduced risk for COVID-19 infection among smokers, in contrast to what occurs in most respiratory \ninfections. This intriguing observation confirms several recently published studies, that also reported \ndecreased disease incidence among smokers4,6,7,9, although in a smaller scale. Interestingly, even \namong SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, we found no evidence of significant association between \ncurrent or past smoking and disease severity, as reflected by death during hospitalization or by need \nfor mechanical ventilation. \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the association between smoking and COVID-19 \ninfection in a matched cohort of this scale. The magnitude of association observed for current \nsmoking, with odds of infection reduced by about a half in smokers, suggests a genuine protective \neffect of smoking on the risk of COVID-19. A significant negative association is also observed \nbetween past smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection, although more moderate than the one observed \nfor current smoking. It is unclear whether the latter association reflects long-term changes \nengendered by past smoking, or unreported smoking recidivism among these patients. Among \nAll rights reserved.

Other national cohorts did not \nobserve an increased risk for severe disease among smokers as well, while some smaller studies \nsampling hospitalized patients observed increased risk among smokers1,2,10. These apparently \nconflicting results may reflect different thresholds for patient inclusion. Our cohort included many \npatients who were asymptomatic or had light symptoms and did not undergo hospitalization. It is \npossible that among study samples based on patients hospitalized for serious disease, smoking or \npast smoking contributes to disease aggravation. Future studies should examine more in-depth \nspecific smoking habits, for example light to heavy smoking, to discern whether there is a possible \ndose response, or whether the possible protective effect is based on a specific threshold.  \nThe negative association observed here between smoking and COVID-19 infection incidence is \nuncommon among respiratory infections, and possibly reflects unique infection mechanisms present \nin the novel coronavirus. Changeux et al11, relying on similar observations, propose a crucial role for \nthe nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in COVID-19 pathology. According to their neurotropic \nhypothesis, SARS-CoV-2 invades the central nervous system through the nAChR receptor, present in \nneurons of the olfactory system, as reflected by the frequent occurrence of neurologic symptoms, \nsuch as loss of smell or taste, or intense fatigue in patients affected by COVID-19. Other mechanisms \nmay also affect SARS-CoV-2 infection potential in smokers. It is widely accepted that the angiotensin \nconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) represents the main receptor molecule for SARS-CoV-2, and smoking \nhas been shown to differentially affect ACE2 expression in tissues12–14. Other putative explanations \ncould involve altered cytokine expression such as IL-6, for which increased levels are associated with \nunfavorable disease outcome14,15.  \nThe effect of smoking among the study population was assessed through self-reported information \nroutinely collected during medical visits, prior to occurrence of COVID-19, thus eliminating possible \nrecall bias by patients. The matched cohort design, and the decision to only include patients that \nhave been tested for SARS-CoV-2, overcomes the potential confounding effects of age, gender, and \nethnicity/religious group, on smoking habits. We acknowledge our study's limitations as \nobservational, noting the difficulty in eliminating all possible confounders. However, in the context \nof a harmful and addictive habit such as smoking, a controlled trial is not ethical. \nAcknowledging the destructive effects of smoking on health, the importance of smoking prevention \nand cessation to preserve health, and the highly addictive nature of nicotine, we strongly encourage \nall patients to refrain from smoking, as the long term effects of this hazardous habit far outweigh \npotential benefits in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Lohoff\n1✉\nObservational studies suggest smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, and substance\nuse disorders (SUDs) may impact risk for respiratory infections, including coronavirus 2019\n(COVID-2019). However, causal inference is challenging due to comorbid substance use.\nUsing summary-level European ancestry data (>1.7 million participants), we performed\nsingle-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate relationships\nbetween substance use behaviors, COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. Genetic lia-\nbility for smoking demonstrated the strongest associations with COVID-19 infection risk,\nincluding the risk for very severe respiratory conﬁrmed COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) = 2.69,\n95% CI, 1.42, 5.10, P-value = 0.002), and COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization\n(OR = 3.49, 95% CI, 2.23, 5.44, P-value = 3.74 × 10−8); these associations generally\nremained robust in models accounting for other substance use and cardiometabolic risk\nfactors. Smoking was also strongly associated with increased risk of other respiratory\ninfections, including asthma-related pneumonia/sepsis (OR = 3.64, 95% CI, 2.16, 6.11,\nP-value = 1.07 × 10−6), chronic lower respiratory diseases (OR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.80, 2.91,\nP-value = 1.69 × 10−11), and bacterial pneumonia (OR = 2.14, 95% CI, 1.42, 3.24, P-value =\n2.84 × 10−4). We provide strong genetic evidence showing smoking increases the risk for\nCOVID-19 and other respiratory infections even after accounting for other substance use\nbehaviors and cardiometabolic diseases, which suggests that prevention programs aimed at\nreducing smoking may be important for the COVID-19 pandemic and have substantial public\nhealth beneﬁts.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02685-y\nOPEN\n1 Section on Clinical Genomics and Experimental Therapeutics, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,\nMD, USA. 2 NIH-Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program; Nufﬁeld Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 3These authors\ncontributed equally: Daniel B.

More broadly, upper and lower respiratory infections\n(URIs and LRIs, respectively) and other respiratory diseases (i.e.,\nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc.) are\nleading causes of yearly worldwide morbidity and mortality4,5.\nFor example, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that\nLRIs caused more than two million deaths globally in 20164,\nwhile approximately 2.3 million people died from COPD in\n20155. Respiratory infection and diseases are also a large eco-\nnomic burden: URIs result in more than 40 million missed days\nof school and work per year6.\nSubstance use (tobacco smoking, cannabis use, and alcohol\nconsumption) are risk factors linked with adverse lung and\nrespiratory outcomes7–9. For example, observational data has\nshown chronic heavy alcohol consumption to be associated with\nincreased risk for pneumonia7 and acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome10, while cannabis smoke has been shown to contain\nmany of the same toxins and irritants as smoke derived from\ntobacco11, but may differ from tobacco in its association with\nbronchitis and other respiratory infections12. In addition, it has\nbeen suggested that chronic alcohol abuse may compromise the\nability of immune cells to destroy bacteria in the lungs, which\nmay result in an increased vulnerability to respiratory infections\nlike pneumonia and tuberculosis13.\nParalleling the COVID-19 pandemic have been increases in\nsubstance use14, which combined with data showing approxi-\nmately 10.8% of US adults suffering from a substance use disorder\n(SUD)15 and recent work using electronic health records (EHRs)\nto show that individuals with a SUD are at increased risk for\nCOVID-1916, suggest identifying potential causal relationships\nbetween substance use, SUD and respiratory infectious diseases\nwould have substantial public health beneﬁts.\nHowever, observational studies cannot be used to reliably\nidentify causality due to limitations such as residual confounding\nand reverse causality17. For example, outcomes reached from\nobservational studies may be subject to unmeasured confounders\nlike comorbid disorders or underlying genetic differences that\nmay lead to biased estimates, and consequently, may not reﬂect\ntrue causal relationships18,19. While randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) are considered the “gold standard”, RCTs can be both\nunethical and impractical20,21. Constructing an RCT to examine\nthe effect of substance use on respiratory infection risk may be\nfurther complicated by other existing comorbidities.\nMendelian randomization (MR) is a genetic approach that uses\ngenetic variants as instrumental variables to explore causal rela-\ntions between exposures (e.g., alcohol consumption, tobacco\nsmoking, cannabis use) and health outcomes (e.g., respiratory\ninfections and diseases). This technique takes publicly available\ngenome wide association studies to screen for suitable genetic\ninstrumental variables, which allows researchers to perform MR\nstudies without the need to recruit new patients22. Because\ngermline variants are randomly assorted at meiosis, MR may be\nconsidered conceptually equivalent to RCTs, though a more\nnaturalized version19,22. More speciﬁcally, given genetic instru-\nments cannot be inﬂuenced by other confounders (i.e., lifestyle, or\nenvironmental factors), MR studies, are in theory, less susceptible\nto confounding or reverse causality than traditional observational\nstudies23. Therefore, MR is an important analytical approach to\nstrengthen causal inference when RCTs are challenging due to\nmethodological or ethical constraints24. Given the potential for\nconfounding and limited causal inference derived from observa-\ntional data, we used large, publicly available genome-wide asso-\nciation study (GWAS) data and two-sample MR methods to\nevaluate the relationships between substance use, substance use\ndisorders (cannabis use disorder (CUD) and alcohol use disorder\n(AUD)) and respiratory infection and disease outcomes. Finding\nthe genetic liability for smoking increases the risk for COVID-19\nand several other respiratory infections, even after accounting for\nother substance use behaviors builds upon recent literature\nidentifying modiﬁable risk factors for COVID-19 risk9,25,26, and\nalso may inform research and clinical practice given the recent\nincrease in substance use, abuse, and use disorders paralleling the\nCOVID-19 pandemic14.\nResults\nAssociations of substance use and SUDs with COVID-19\ninfection risk. COVID-19 results comparing SVMR and MVMR\nresults are presented in Table 1. Supplementary Data 8–12 pre-\nsent the full COVID-19 results. Broadly, among all substance use\nexposures, the genetic liability for lifetime tobacco smoking\nconsistently\ndemonstrated\nthe\nstrongest\nassociations\nwith\nCOVID-19 infection risk, including the risk for very severe\nrespiratory conﬁrmed COVID-19 (SVMR odds ratio (OR) = 2.69,\n95% CI, 1.42, 5.10, P-value = 0.002), and also the risk for\nCOVID-19\ninfection\nrequiring\nhospitalization\n(hospitalized\nCOVID-19 vs population: SVMR odds ratio (OR) = 3.49, 95% CI,\n2.23, 5.44, P-value = 3.74 × 10−8; MVMR accounting for sub-\nstance use disorders OR = 3.61, 95% CI, 2.19, 5.95, P-value =\n4.92 × 10−7; and hospitalized vs not hospitalized COVID-19:\nSVMR OR = 3.44, 95% CI, 1.72, 6.87, P-value = 4.60 × 10−4;\nMVMR OR = 3.61, 95% CI, 1.63, 8.01, P-value = 0.002) (Table 1;\nSupplementary Data 8, 10, and 11). This association remained\nrobust in secondary sensitivity analyses excluding UK Biobank\nparticipants in the COVID-19 outcome GWAS, but with reduced\nprecision (hospitalized COVID-19 vs population: SVMR OR =\n2.42,95% CI, 1.46, 4.01, P-value = 6.09 × 10−4; MVMR OR =\n2.62, 95% CI, 1.46, 4.71, P-value = 0.001; and hospitalized vs not\nhospitalized COVID-19: SVMR OR = 3.27, 95% CI, 1.15, 9.33, P-\nvalue = 0.03; MVMR OR = 4.84, 95% CI, 1.46, 15.39, P-value =\n0.008) (Supplementary Data 8, 10, and 11). Importantly, these\nassociations were consistent across complementary SVMR and\nMVMR methods, including single variable GSMR (Supplemen-\ntary Data 8, 10, and 11). Leave-one-out analyses highlight var-\niants with heterogeneous causal effects that would be ﬂagged as\ninvalid by MR PRESSO and MV MR Lasso and removed for\noutlier corrected results (Supplementary Data 9).\nGiven the strong associations of lifetime tobacco smoking and\nCOVID-19 risk, we further evaluated robustness by performing\nMVMR analyses accounting for cardiometabolic disorders (CAD,\nT2D, and obesity) previously reported as risk factors for COVID-\n19 risk27–29. Genetic liability for lifetime tobacco smoking\ngenerally remained associated with increased risk for COVID-\n19\nhospitalization\n(e.g.,\naccounting\nfor\nCAD,\nhospitalized\nCOVID-19 vs. population: MVMR OR = 3.18, 95% CI, 2.06,\n4.92, P-value = 1.80 × 10−7; accounting for Type 2 diabetes,\nMVMR OR = 4.16, 95% CI, 2.51, 6.92, P-value = 3.76 × 10−8;\naccounting for obesity, MVMR OR = 3.75, 95% CI, 2.25, 6.25,\nP-value = 4.01 × 10−7) (Supplementary Data 12).\nAssociations of substance use and SUDs with other respiratory\ninfectious disease risk.

Tobacco smoking, for example,\nwas associated with increased risk of asthma-related infections\nand asthma-related pneumonia/sepsis (SVMR OR = 2.52, 95%\nCI, 1.59, 3.97, P-value = 7.29 × 10−7; accounting for substance\nuse disorders, MVMR OR = 3.64, 95% CI, 2.16, 6.11, P-value =\n1.07 × 10−6), but for neither bronchitis nor the common cold\n(Table 3; Supplementary Data 13–15). Tobacco smoking was also\nassociated with chronic lower respiratory diseases (SVMR\nOR = 2.23, 95% CI, 1.73, 2.87, P-value = 5.69 × 10−10; MVMR\nOR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.80, 2.91, P-value = 1.69 × 10−11) and\nseveral pneumonia-related outcomes, including bacterial pneu-\nmonia (SVMR OR = 2.22, 95% CI, 1.57, 3.15, P-value =\n7.32 × 10−6; MVMR OR = 2.14, 95% CI, 1.42, 3.24, P-value =\n2.84 × 10−4) (Table 5, Supplementary Data 13–15).\nAs with the smoking-COVID-19 ﬁndings, we tested robustness\nof the smoking-respiratory infection risk results using additional\nMVMR models that accounted for cardiometabolic disorders\n(CAD, T2D, and obesity) with evidence for an impact on\nrespiratory infection risk30–32. Our smoking-related results were\nbroadly robust to inclusion of cardiometabolic confounders\n(Supplementary Data 16). These associations were generally\nconsistent across complementary SVMR and MVMR methods,\nincluding single variable GSMR (Supplementary Data 13–16).\nLeave-one-out analyses again highlight variants with heteroge-\nneous causal effects that would be ﬂagged as invalid by MR\nPRESSO and MV MR Lasso and removed for outlier corrected\nresults (Supplementary Data 17).\nDiscussion\nUsing large summary-level GWAS data and complementary two-\nsample MR methods, we show that the genetic liability for\ntobacco smoking has potential causal relationships with several\nrespiratory infection and disease outcomes, including COVID-19.\nThese tobacco smoking-respiratory ﬁndings were supported by\nmultivariable MR analyses accounting for alcohol and cannabis\nuse and abuse, which in addition to the broadly consistent IVW\nresults (within the IVW MR 95% conﬁdence interval but typically\nless precise) with estimates from the weighted median, weighted\nmode, and MR Egger sensitivity analyses strengthen causal\ninference. Further, in single variable MR, we identify potential\nadverse impacts of CUD on lower respiratory infections, the\ncommon cold, and several asthma-related infections, suggesting\nevidence for a dose-dependent impact of cannabis use where\nheavy cannabis use may be harmful to the respiratory system. In\nparallel, we ﬁnd little evidence for an alcohol-respiratory infection\nrelationship suggesting that previous observational data may be\ndue to confounding.\nOur COVID-19 results extend recent MR studies showing\nadverse effects of smoking on COVID-19 risk by accounting for\nhighly comorbid alcohol consumption, cannabis use, and SUDs,\nwhich when combined with reports suggesting smoking intensi-\nﬁes the severity of COVID-19 symptoms33,34, the risk for being\nTable 1 Single variable and multivariable MR results of the genetic liability of alcohol, cannabis and lifetime smoking exposures\non COVID-19 outcomes.\nSingle-variable MR\nMultivariable MR\nN SNPs\nOR\n95%\nCI Lower\n95%\nCI Upper\nP-value\nN SNPs\nMV OR\n95%\nCI Lower\n95%\nCI Upper\nP-value\nVery severe respiratory conﬁrmed\nCOVID-19 vs. population\nTobacco smoking\n91\n2.69\n1.42\n5.10\n0.002\n111\n2.72\n1.27\n5.82\n0.010\nCannabis use\n28\n1.17\n0.92\n1.50\n0.207\n114\n1.03\n0.76\n2.80\n0.856\nCUD\n22\n0.97\n0.82\n1.15\n0.748\n111\n1.02\n0.86\n1.22\n0.805\nDrinks per week\n22\n1.39\n0.52\n3.74\n0.511\n114\n0.83\n0.33\n2.30\n0.698\nAUD\n9\n0.91\n0.75\n1.11\n0.344\n111\n0.95\n0.82\n1.09\n0.442\nHospitalized COVID-19 vs. not\nhospitalized COVID-19\nTobacco smoking\n91\n3.44\n1.72\n6.87\n4.60E−04\n111\n3.61\n1.63\n8.01\n0.002\nCannabis use\n28\n0.87\n0.68\n1.11\n0.270\n114\n1.02\n0.77\n2.78\n0.883\nCUD\n21\n1.07\n0.91\n1.25\n0.404\n111\n1.04\n0.87\n1.25\n0.627\nDrinks per week\n21\n0.69\n0.27\n1.76\n0.432\n114\n0.37\n0.15\n1.45\n0.034\nAUD\n9\n0.83\n0.69\n0.99\n0.035\n111\n0.94\n0.81\n1.10\n0.451\nHospitalized COVID-19 vs. population\nTobacco smoking\n91\n3.49\n2.23\n5.44\n3.74E−08\n111\n3.61\n2.19\n5.95\n4.92E−07\nCannabis use\n28\n0.99\n0.85\n1.16\n0.887\n114\n1.00\n0.83\n2.73\n0.964\nCUD\n21\n0.99\n0.90\n1.10\n0.871\n111\n1.01\n0.90\n1.13\n0.915\nDrinks per week\n21\n1.01\n0.57\n1.81\n0.964\n114\n0.59\n0.32\n1.80\n0.079\nAUD\n8\n0.94\n0.82\n1.08\n0.375\n111\n0.98\n0.89\n1.07\n0.633\nCOVID-19 vs. population\nTobacco smoking\n91\n1.21\n0.97\n1.52\n0.095\n111\n1.25\n0.95\n1.64\n0.104\nCannabis use\n28\n1.11\n1.02\n1.21\n0.022\n114\n1.04\n0.95\n2.83\n0.404\nCUD\n21\n0.98\n0.93\n1.03\n0.436\n111\n0.98\n0.92\n1.04\n0.411\nDrinks per week\n21\n1.09\n0.81\n1.47\n0.565\n114\n0.93\n0.68\n2.52\n0.622\nAUD\n8\n1.08\n1.00\n1.16\n0.039\n111\n1.03\n0.98\n1.08\n0.310\nNotes: Results from two sample SVMR inverse-variance weighted MR analysis; outliers identiﬁed by MR PRESSO global test and, for MVMR, MV MR Lasso penalization were removed; estimated\nassociations reported as odds ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Potential mechanisms by which\nsmoking increases respiratory infection risk include structural\nchanges to the respiratory tract and a dysregulated cellular and\nhumoral immune response, including peribronchiolar inﬂam-\nmation, decreased levels of circulating immunoglobulins, and\nchanges to pathogen adherence. For example, smoking has been\nshown to stimulate the release of catecholamine and corticos-\nteroids, which may, in turn, increase circulating CD8+ lympho-\ncytes and suppress the host defense against infections. Notably,\nmany immunological effects related to smoking may resolve\nwithin six weeks of smoking cessation, which suggests that\nsmoking cessation programs may have an important impact on\nreducing respiratory infections.\nRegarding cannabis use, while we failed to ﬁnd evidence of any\nrelationships, smoking cannabis, like tobacco smoking, may\nprompt the onset of coughing, which could consequently increase\nviral\ntransmission,\nor may\npossibly exacerbate respiratory\nsymptoms.\nAs cannabis is the most used drug worldwide—an estimated\n188 million recreational users worldwide—this aspect of cannabis\nuse may have important implications for the spread of COVID-\n19. In contrast, the single-variable MR CUD results demonstrated\nadverse effects on several respiratory outcomes, but not COPD,\nwhich supports the existing literature39–41; however, accounting\nfor lifetime tobacco smoking attenuated the CUD results, thus\nhighlighting the complex nature of these relationships. Further,\nhabitual cannabis smoking may have several effects on respiratory\nand immune systems that may impact respiratory infection sus-\nceptibility. For example, structural abnormalities in alveolar\nmacrophages and coincident dysregulated cytokine production\nand antimicrobial activity have been reported. While our study\nprovides preliminary genetic evidence suggesting potential causal\nrelationships between heavy cannabis use and respiratory infec-\ntion, additional triangulating lines of evidence (i.e., immune\nmonitoring studies) are required to further elucidate the CUD-\nrespiratory infection relationship. However, given that the toxin\nand irritant proﬁles of cannabis and tobacco smoke are similar11,\nthe direct route of administration via inhalation for these\nTable 2 Single variable and multivariable MR results of the genetic liability of alcohol, cannabis and lifetime smoking exposures\non asthma-related respiratory infections.\nOutcome\nExposure\nSingle-variable MR\nMultivariable MR\nN SNPs\nOR\n95%\nCI Lower\n95%\nCI Upper\nP-value\nN SNPs\nOR\n95%\nCI Lower\n95%\nCI Upper\nP-value\nAsthma related\nacute respiratory\ninfections\nTobacco smoking\n116\n2.06\n1.39\n3.05\n3.15E−04\n137\n2.07\n1.31\n3.26\n0.002\nCannabis Use\n35\n1.07\n0.98\n1.16\n0.128\n142\n1.03\n0.88\n1.22\n0.704\nCUD\n27\n1.10\n1.03\n1.19\n0.007\n137\n1.01\n0.92\n1.11\n0.835\nDrinks Per Week\n32\n0.92\n0.56\n1.53\n0.757\n142\n1.06\n0.65\n1.72\n0.816\nAUD\n11\n1.04\n0.93\n1.17\n0.456\n137\n1.01\n0.93\n1.10\n0.826\nAsthma related\ninfections\nTobacco smoking\n115\n2.31\n1.61\n3.31\n5.69E−06\n127\n2.15\n1.45\n3.17\n1.21E−04\nCannabis Use\n35\n1.02\n0.94\n1.09\n0.672\n142\n1.06\n0.91\n1.23\n0.484\nCUD\n27\n1.08\n1.00\n1.16\n0.040\n127\n0.98\n0.91\n1.07\n0.662\nDrinks Per Week\n32\n0.94\n0.61\n1.44\n0.773\n142\n0.96\n0.61\n1.49\n0.845\nAUD\n11\n1.04\n0.95\n1.13\n0.385\n127\n1.03\n0.96\n1.10\n0.358\nAsthma-related\npneumonia\nTobacco smoking\n116\n2.52\n1.59\n3.97\n7.29E−05\n138\n3.64\n2.16\n6.11\n1.07E−06\nCannabis Use\n36\n0.95\n0.85\n1.06\n0.382\n136\n1.07\n0.90\n1.27\n0.500\nCUD\n27\n1.07\n0.98\n1.18\n0.120\n138\n0.95\n0.85\n1.06\n0.380\nDrinks Per Week\n31\n1.47\n0.83\n2.59\n0.187\n136\n1.09\n0.61\n1.93\n0.272\nAUD\n11\n1.09\n0.97\n1.21\n0.132\n138\n0.99\n0.90\n1.08\n0.755\nAsthma-related\npneumonia or\nsepsis\nTobacco smoking\n116\n2.54\n1.61\n4.02\n6.54E−05\n138\n3.66\n2.17\n6.16\n1.04E−06\nCannabis Use\n35\n0.96\n0.87\n1.07\n0.472\n141\n1.08\n0.90\n1.31\n0.401\nCUD\n27\n1.07\n0.98\n1.18\n0.122\n138\n0.95\n0.85\n1.07\n0.399\nDrinks Per Week\n32\n1.85\n1.04\n3.26\n0.035\n141\n1.15\n0.66\n2.00\n0.616\nAUD\n11\n1.09\n0.97\n1.21\n0.138\n138\n0.98\n0.89\n1.08\n0.734\nNotes: Results from two sample SVMR inverse-variance weighted MR analysis; outliers identiﬁed by MR PRESSO global test and, for MVMR, MV MR Lasso penalization were removed; estimated\nassociations reported as odds ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Therefore, it is possible that the observational study-\nbased alcohol-respiratory infection links may be due, instead, to\ntobacco smoking; however, future work will be needed to conﬁrm\nthis hypothesis. In addition, it is important to note that our\nresults should not be interpreted as suggesting that alcohol does\nnot impact overall lung health and structure, which has been\npreviously reported7. Further, while we failed to ﬁnd evidence\nthat weekly alcohol consumption impacted COVID-19 risk, the\nCenters for Disease Control recently showed that dining at on-\nsite locations, such as restaurants and bars, is associated with\nincreased COVID-19 risk; since alcohol consumption may lower\ninhibition and increase impulsivity, individuals consuming alco-\nhol may take social distancing less seriously, and thereby unin-\ntentionally spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nThis study has several strengths including the use of multiple\nalcohol consumption and cannabis use variables, which enabled\nus to evaluate various dimensions of substance use and abuse and\nidentify possible causal relationships of substance use disorders\nand respiratory outcomes. In addition, our main single variable\nanalyses included multiple MR methods, each relying on ortho-\ngonal assumptions, which provide conﬁdence in robustness of the\nresults and strengthen causal inference46. Our multivariable two-\nsample MR design, the most appropriate design given the strong\ncorrelation between tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and\ncannabis use, yielded estimates that account for these correlated\nbehaviors for each exposure on COVID-19 risk and other\nrespiratory outcomes. Another strength is our extension of\nMVMR to test the robustness of the main tobacco smoking\nﬁndings by incorporating other potential confounders that may\nimpact infectious disease risk (obesity, cardiovascular disease,\nand T2D).\nThis study also has limitations. A main limitation is the pos-\nsibility of collider bias—especially with regards to the COVID-19\ndatasets47. Collider bias may occur when analyses are controls or\nselects the sample based upon a collider variable that is caused by\nboth the exposure and outcome variables and distorts the true\nunderlying association48,49. The recent commentaries by Grifﬁth\net al. (2020) and Tattan-Birch et al. (2020) discuss in detail the\npotential for collider bias in COVID-19 datasets47,49, and are\nimportant for context when interpreting COVID-19 ﬁndings\nbased upon observational data. For example, an observational\nstudy from early in the COVID-19 pandemic reported an\napparent protective effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19\nrisk50; however, as Tattan-Birch et al. discuss, both smoking and\nCOVID-19 may cause coughing, which, during the COVID-19\npandemic, may increase the likelihood for smokers to be tested\nand their subsequent overrepresentation among clinical study\nparticipants testing negative for COVID-1949. As a result, among\nsamples with COVID-19 tests, smoking may appear to have a\nprotective effect49. While it is often not possible to ensure the\nabsence of collider bias47, we aimed to design our study incor-\nporating measures that may mitigate its impact. For example, we\nused the most recently released version of publicly available\nCOVID-19 data (from January 18, 2021)51 that may include\nparticipants more representative of the general population com-\npared to samples collected earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReassuringly, we also found similar smoking effect estimates in\nseveral respiratory-related infection outcomes, which suggests a\nbroader impact of smoking on the respiratory system that extends\nto COVID-19.\nIn addition, as with all self-reported substance use literature,\nthese exposures may be either under- or over-reported52. Because\nmany of the datasets included UK Biobank participants, who are\nmore educated, lead healthier lifestyles, and have fewer health\nproblems than the UK population53, this discrepancy may\nlimit the applicability of our ﬁndings to other populations.\nRegarding our mainly null alcohol-respiratory infection results, it\nis possible that alcohol may have indirect impacts on infection\nrisk through a modiﬁed immune response54, or other system\ndysregulations that may modulate infection risk that we were not\nable to directly assess using MR. However, like other recent\npsychiatric MR studies where the exposure instruments included\na relaxed statistical threshold, our binge drinking and AUD\ninstruments were comprised of independent SNPs associated\nwith the respective drinking behavior (i.e., P-value < 5 × 10−6)\nfor SNP inclusion due to the lack of conventionally GWS SNPs\nTable 5 Single variable and multivariable MR results of the genetic liability of alcohol, cannabis and lifetime smoking exposures\non pneumonia risk.\nOutcome\nExposure\nSingle-variable MR\nMultivariable MR\nN SNPs\nOR\n95% CI Lower\n95% CI Upper\nP-value\nN SNPs\nOR\n95% CI Lower\n95% CI Upper\nP-value\nBacterial pneumonia\nTobacco smoking\n117\n2.22\n1.57\n3.15\n7.32E−06\n138\n2.14\n1.42\n3.24\n2.84E−04\nCannabis Use\n36\n1.05\n0.96\n1.15\n0.268\n142\n0.97\n0.84\n1.12\n0.685\nCUD\n27\n1.05\n0.98\n1.13\n0.145\n138\n1.02\n0.93\n1.12\n0.648\nDrinks Per Week\n33\n1.17\n0.72\n1.89\n0.530\n142\n1.19\n0.78\n1.83\n0.416\nAUD\n11\n1.04\n0.95\n1.14\n0.426\n138\n1.01\n0.93\n1.08\n0.892\nAll Pneumoniae\nTobacco smoking\n115\n1.52\n1.22\n1.88\n1.34E−04\n134\n1.46\n1.15\n1.85\n0.002\nCannabis Use\n34\n1.01\n0.96\n1.06\n0.833\n136\n1.03\n0.95\n1.12\n0.439\nCUD\n27\n1.05\n1.01\n1.09\n0.014\n134\n0.98\n0.94\n1.04\n0.544\nDrinks Per Week\n31\n0.97\n0.76\n1.24\n0.814\n136\n0.96\n0.75\n1.23\n0.750\nAUD\n11\n1.05\n1.00\n1.11\n0.056\n134\n1.01\n0.97\n1.05\n0.625\nViral Pneumonia\nTobacco smoking\n117\n1.66\n0.53\n5.17\n0.386\n138\n1.70\n0.44\n6.52\n0.443\nCannabis Use\n36\n1.07\n0.81\n1.41\n0.638\n142\n1.34\n0.84\n2.15\n0.221\nCUD\n27\n1.00\n0.78\n1.28\n0.993\n138\n0.90\n0.67\n1.20\n0.479\nDrinks Per Week\n33\n2.24\n0.60\n8.43\n0.232\n142\n1.27\n0.32\n5.04\n0.736\nAUD\n11\n1.13\n0.85\n1.51\n0.409\n138\n1.09\n0.85\n1.39\n0.501\nNotes: Results from two sample SVMR inverse-variance weighted MR analysis; outliers identiﬁed by MR PRESSO global test and, for MVMR, MV MR Lasso penalization were removed; estimated\nassociations reported as odds ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Because\nheavy alcohol consumption and AUD have been previously\nlinked with acute respiratory distress syndrome10—one of the\nmost severe complications of COVID-19—future studies should\nre-evaluate the links between heavy alcohol consumption and\nAUD when better powered GWAS data become available.\nFurther, the included samples were comprised of primarily\nwhite individuals of European ancestry, and research has shown\nstrong racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19\nrisk and severity57–59. Therefore, we caution the generalization of\nthese ﬁndings and urge future work to investigate these rela-\ntionships using a genetics-based approach in other populations\nwhen the data become available. Another limitation is the overlap\nof the UKB participants between the alcohol consumption, life-\ntime smoking, and COVID-19 outcomes, which may bias\nresulting estimates60. However, potential bias would likely be\nminimal60, and it has also been shown that two-sample MR may\nbe used in single samples provided the data is derived from large\nbiobanks, i.e., the UKB, FinnGen, etc61. Also, results were largely\nunchanged when we performed analyses using the COVID-19\nendpoints excluding UKB participants suggesting minimal bias.\nIn conclusion, our data provide genetic evidence of adverse\nrelationships between smoking and many respiratory-related\ndisease outcomes ranging from the common cold to severe\nCOVID-19, which suggests prevention programs aimed at\nsmoking cessation and prevention may have public health and\nclinical beneﬁts.\nMethods\nData sources and genetic instruments. Summary-level data for both modiﬁable\nrisk factor instrument and infectious disease outcome data were derived from\npublicly available GWASs in populations of predominantly European ancestry\n(Fig. 1; Table 6; Supplementary Data 1). All GWASs have existing ethical per-\nmissions from their respective institutional review boards and include participant\ninformed consent with rigorous quality control. For this study, we included all\nexposure SNPs associated at conventional genome-wide signiﬁcance (GWAS)\nP < 5 × 10−8 for smoking, alcohol and cannabis use, and 5 × 10−6 for AUD and\nCUD due to the relatively low number of SNPs at GWS, clumped at linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) r2 = 0.001 and a distance of 10,000 kb, using reference samples\ncomprised of participants of European ancestry 62.\nTobacco smoking. We included lifetime smoking instruments from the recent\nGWAS of a lifetime smoking index/score (which combined smoking initiation,\nduration, heaviness and cessation), conducted in a sample of 462 690 current,\nformer and never smokers in the UKB (mean score value 0.359 (standard deviation\n(SD) = 0.694); sample: 54% female, mean age 56.7 years, 54% never smokers, 36%\nformer smokers, and 11% current smokers63,64. (An SD increase in lifetime\nsmoking index score would be equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 15\nyears and stopping 17 years previously or 60 cigarettes per day for 13 years and\nstopping 22 years previously)63 (Supplementary Data 2).\nCannabis use. We included two cannabis-related instrument sets: cannabis use\nand CUD. Summary statistics for lifetime cannabis use (a yes/no variable of\nwhether participants reported using cannabis during their lifetime) were obtained\nfrom the PGC meta-analysis GWAS of 3 cohorts (International Cannabis Con-\nsortium (35,297 respondents, 55.5 percent female, ages 16–87, mean 35.7 years;\n42.8 percent had used cannabis); UKB (126 785 respondents, 56.3 percent female,\nages 39–72, mean age 55.0 years, 22.3 percent had used cannabis); and 23andMe\n(22,683 respondents, 55.3 percent female, ages 18–94, mean age 54.0 years, 43.2%\nhad used cannabis))65,66. CUD instruments were obtained from a recent PGC\nmeta-analysis of three cohorts of predominantly European ancestry (PGC, Lund-\nbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH), and\ndeCODE cohorts, excluding related individuals from PGC family-based cohorts;\ndemographics not available), including 14,808 cases of cannabis abuse or depen-\ndence deﬁned as meeting DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV, DSM-5, or ICD10 codes (depending\non study cohort) criteria; the 358 534 controls were deﬁned as anyone not meeting\nthe criteria67,68 (Supplementary Data 3).\nAlcohol consumption. We included two instrument sets related to alcohol use:\ndrinks per week69, and AUD. Drinks per week instruments were obtained from the\nGSCAN GWAS meta-analysis of 29 cohorts (941 280 individuals; demographics\nnot available) of predominantly white European ancestry69,70. Given the varied\ncohort methods used to measure alcohol consumption (binned, normalized, etc.),\nthe data was log transformed: thus, the effect estimate is measured in log trans-\nformed drinks per week69 (Supplementary Data 4). For the AUD instrument set,\nwe used the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) GWAS meta-analysis of 28\ncohorts (51.6% female, 8485 cases, 20,657 controls) of predominantly European\nancestry71,72. AUD was diagnosed by either clinician rating or semi-structured\ninterview using DSM-IV criteria including the presence of at least three of seven\nalcohol-related symptoms (withdrawal, drinking larger amounts/drinking for\nlonger time, tolerance, desire or attempts to cut down drinking, giving up\nimportant activities to drink, time related to drinking, or continued alcohol con-\nsumption despite psychological and/or physical problems)73 (Supplementary\nData 4).\nFor the multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses, we concatenated independent\ninstrument sets for alcohol use, cannabis use and lifetime smoking, and also AUD,\nCUD, and lifetime smoking, clumping the resulting two multivariable (MV)\nFig. 1 Study overview.

We were unable to calculate conditional F statistics to assess the\nstrength of the multivariable instrument sets: SVMR statistical methods recently\nextended to two sample MVMR are appropriate only for non-overlapping exposure\nsummary level data sources. When overlapping, the requisite pairwise covariances\nbetween SNP associations are only determinable by using individual level data 80.\nCOVID-19 outcomes. We used summary GWAS statistics from the COVID-19\nHost Genetics Initiative (COVID-19 hg) meta-analysis round 5a (18 January 2021\nrelease date) (https://www.covid19hg.org/results)81 for four COVID-19 phenotypes\nin cohorts of European ancestry, both including and excluding the UKB cohorts for\nsensitivity analyses (N cases; N controls): very severe respiratory conﬁrmed\nCOVID-19 versus population (4606; 702,801); very severe respiratory conﬁrmed\nCOVID-19 versus population excluding UKB cohorts (4297; 374,224); hospitalized\nversus not hospitalized COVID-19 (4829; 11,816); hospitalized versus not hospi-\ntalized COVID-19 excluding UKB cohorts (3159; 7206); hospitalized COVID-19\nversus population (9373; 1,197,256); hospitalized COVID-19 versus population\nexcluding UKB cohorts (7703; 868,679); COVID-19 versus population (29,071;\n1,559,712); COVID-19 versus population excluding UKB cohorts (22,581;\n1,231,135) (demographics not available) (Fig. 1; Table 6; Supplementary Data 1).\nOther respiratory infection and disease outcomes. We used data from FinnGen\nRelease 5 (released to public, 11 May 2021) for additional respiratory-related\noutcomes82, including acute upper respiratory infections, asthma related acute\nrespiratory infections, pneumonia, inﬂuenza, bronchitis, chronic lower respiratory\ndiseases, and acute nasopharyngitis (common cold) (N ≤218,792) (Fig. 1; Table 6;\nSupplementary Data 1). FinnGen is a public-private partnership incorporating\ngenetic data for disease endpoints from Finnish biobanks and Finnish health\nregistry EHRs82. Detailed documentation is provided on the FinnGen website\n(https://ﬁnngen.gitbook.io/documentation/).\nSample independence. Participant overlap in samples used to estimate genetic\nassociations between exposures and outcomes can increase weak instrument bias\n(WIB) in MR analyses60,83, but to a lesser extent with large biobank samples\n(including UKB and deCODE).

We have conducted analyses for COVID-19 outcomes\nusing COVID-19 GWAS performed both including and excluding UKB cohorts.\nStatistics and reproducibility. For SVMR analyses, we used inverse-variance\nweighted MR (MR IVW) as the main analyses, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted\nmedian, and weighted mode methods. These are complementary robust methods\ndeveloped to estimate consistent causal effects under weaker assumptions than MR\nIVW to assess evidence of causal effects for each of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use,\nand use disorders on infectious disease outcomes, and evaluate the sensitivity of the\nanalyses to different patterns of violations of IV assumptions85. Consistency of results\nacross methods strengthens an inference of causality85. For MVMR analyses, we used\nthe multivariable extensions of MR IVW, MR Egger, and MR median 83,86.\nWe used the MR Egger intercept test87, Cochran Q heterogeneity test88, and\nmultivariable extensions thereof, to evaluate heterogeneity in instrument effects, as\nheterogeneity may indicate violations of IV assumptions86,87,89. The MR pleiotropy\nresidual sum and outlier (MR PRESSO) global test, and multivariable extensions\nthereof90, were used to facilitate identiﬁcation and removal of outlier instruments\nto correct potential directional horizontal pleiotropy and resolve detected\nheterogeneity. For SVMR, we also used, alternatively, Generalized single variable\nSummary-data based MR (GSMR) to identify and remove instruments with\nheterogeneous causal estimates suspected to be invalid instruments with apparent\npleiotropic effects on both exposure and outcome disease (using the recommended\ndefault HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) -outlier threshold (0.01)\nto retain sufﬁcient power to detect heterogeneity)91. We used the SVMR Steiger\ndirectionality test to test the causal direction between the hypothesized exposure\nand outcomes62. We also performed a leave-one-out analysis to evaluate the\npotential SNPs within each instrument that may be high inﬂuence points85.\nFor MVMR, in addition to the multivariable extension of the MR PRESSO\nglobal test, we used the multivariable extension of the MR Lasso method, which\napplies lasso-type penalization to the direct effects of the instruments on the\noutcome disease: the so-called post-lasso estimate is obtained by performing MR\nIVW using only those instruments identiﬁed as valid instruments (tuning\nparameter speciﬁed at default heterogeneity stopping rule)89. Analyses were carried\nout using TwoSampleMR, version 0.5.585, MendelianRandomization, version 0.5.0,\nin the R environment, version 4.0.2; the GSMR method was implemented in the\nGCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) software (https://cnsgenomics.\ncom/software/gcta/#GSMR).\nReported results and interpretation of ﬁndings. MR IVW odds ratios (OR) with\n95% CI, per unit increase in the exposures (e.g., per unit increase of log-transformed\nalcoholic drinks per week or lifetime smoking index), with P-values derived from\ntwo-sided tests, corrected for outlier or invalid variants, are presented in Tables 1–5.\nFor our COVID-19 analyses, we used a two-sided α of 0.0025 (based on comparing\nfour COVID-19 outcomes and ﬁve substance use exposures) and for the other\ninfectious disease outcomes, a threshold of 0.00071 (based on comparing 14 FinnGen\ninfectious respiratory diseases and ﬁve substance use exposures) as a heuristic that\nallows for follow-up analyses for a plausible number of ﬁndings. In assessing con-\nsistency and robustness, we looked for estimates substantially agreeing in direction\nand magnitude (overlapping conﬁdence intervals) across then four complementary\nMR methods used. We evaluate evidence strength based upon the effect magnitude\nand direction, the 95% conﬁdence interval of that effect, and the P-value.\nReporting summary.

  "VGJCUN.pdf": "Open Peer Review on Qeios\nSmoking and COVID-19: Rapid evidence\nreview for the Royal College of Physicians,\nLondon (UK)\nDavid Simons1, Jamie Brown2, Lion Shahab2, Olga Perski2\n1 Royal Veterinary College, RVC\n2 University College London, University of London\nAbstract\nSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, an emergent zoonotic disease which \nhas reached pandemic levels and is designated a public health emergency of \ninternational concern by the World Health Organisation. Early data suggest that older \nage, male sex and a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes independently increase the \nrisk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19; however, the biological mechanisms \nunderpinning these associations are currently unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters \nhuman cells through the ACE2 receptor. Current and past tobacco smoking is \nassociated with changes in the ACE2 receptor expression, hypertension, diabetes and \nworse outcomes following other viral infections. It is hence plausible that smoking is \nan independent risk factor for hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. Here, we \nreview available evidence for an association between smoking status and \nhospitalisation for COVID-19. We highlight concerns regarding the quality of available \ndata and call for more systematic collection of smoking status in future studies.\nLarge age and gender differences in case severity and mortality have been observed in\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic[1]​; these differences are currently unexplained. Early\nevidence suggests that hypertension and diabetes are key risk factors for heightened\nmorbidity and mortality from COVID-19.\n \nSARS-CoV-2 has been shown to enter epithelial cells through the ACE2 receptor[2]​. Some\nevidence suggests that gene expression and subsequent receptor levels are elevated in\nthe airway and oral epithelium of current smokers[3]​[4]​[5]​, thus putting smokers at higher\nrisk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Other studies, however, show that nicotine\ndownregulates the ACE2 receptor[6]​. These uncertainties notwithstanding, both past and\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, April 1, 2020\nQeios ID: VGJCUN   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/VGJCUN\n1/6\ncurrent smoking is known to increase the risk of respiratory viral[7]​[8]​ and bacterial[9]​[10]​\n infections and is associated with worse outcomes once infected. Cigarette smoke\nreduces the respiratory immune defence through peri-bronchiolar inflammation and\nfibrosis, impaired mucociliary clearance and disruption of the respiratory epithelium[11]​.\nThere is also reason to believe that behavioural factors (e.g. regular hand-to-mouth\nmovements) involved in smoking may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissions as has been\nobserved for other viruses[12]​. However, early data from the COVID-19 pandemic have\nnot provided clear evidence for a negative impact of smoking on COVID-19 related\noutcomes, such as hospitalisation or mortality[13]​.\n \nAvailable data from China suggest a lower than expected number of hospital admissions\namong the smoking population. Crude (non age-stratified) smoking prevalence in China is\nreported at 54% among men and 2.6% among women[14]​; however, a review of 8\nChinese studies with data on smoking status suggest fewer hospitalised smokers than\nwould be expected from national prevalence estimates[15]​. The largest of these studies\npresented smoking status for 1085 patients hospitalised with COVID-19[1]​. 12.6% were\ncurrent smokers, 1.9% past smokers and 85.4% were never smokers. Current and past\nsmokers had worse outcomes (defined as ITU admission or death) than never smokers\nat 12%, 24% and 4.8%, respectively. Two further studies presented smoking status for\n191 and 140 hospitalised patients, respectively. In the first study[16]​, 11 individuals (5.8%)\nwere identified as current smokers with 6 surviving until discharge. The second study\nreported 2 current (1.4%) and 7 past (5%) smokers with severe disease[17]​. Five further\nstudies[18]​[19]​[20]​[21]​[22]​ identified 46 current or past smokers in a combined population of\n386 hospitalised patients. Across these studies, data were presented for 1,690 admitted\npatients, 56 of whom (3.3%) were identified as being current or past smokers.\n \nThese early studies are limited by a number of factors. First, they describe populations\nadmitted to intensive care in the context of an emerging epidemic; hence, it is likely that\ndata collection on smoking status was not considered a priority. As a consequence,\ncurrent smoking rates are likely to be underreported and past smoking may be conflated\nwith never smoking. For example, past smoking was only reported in 3/8 studies. In\nChina, approximately 69% of men aged 60+ years have a history of or are current\nsmokers, which suggests that a non-trivial proportion of past smokers for whom a\nperiod of regular smoking earlier in life might have caused lasting disruption to the\nrespiratory system are not taken into account. Second, individuals with severe symptoms\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, April 1, 2020\nQeios ID: VGJCUN   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/VGJCUN\n2/6\nfrom COVID-19 may have stopped smoking prior to admission to a care facility and may\ntherefore not have been recorded as current smokers (i.e. reverse causality)[23]​. Third,\nsmokers with COVID-19 may be less likely to present to hospital because of lack of\naccess to healthcare and more likely to die in the community from sudden complications\n(i.e. self-selection)[23]​. Fourth, if we take at face value the observation that smoking\nappears to be substantially protective against hospitalisation for COVID-19, we would\nexpect a female rather than male preponderance of patients in the cited studies[24]​. Fifth,\nit should also be noted that smoking is a risk factor for both hypertension and diabetes,\ntwo diseases associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19, which suggests that\ncurrent and past smoking may be both directly and indirectly implicated in COVID-19\noutcomes.\n \nIn the UK, smoking status is systematically recorded in individuals admitted to hospital\nwith respiratory illnesses. We are currently in the process of developing a case-control\nstudy based at a London acute care trust to understand the added risk of hospitalisation\ndue to COVID-19, compared with admission for seasonal influenza or lower respiratory\ntract infections a year previous. We also plan to add relevant questions to a monthly\npopulation survey of the general population of adults in England, and will provide up to\ndate statistics on www.smokinginengland.info. In the meantime, we believe that high\nquality smoking cessation advice should form part of public health efforts during COVID-\n19 (e.g. https://www.todayistheday.co.uk/. At the very least, smoking cessation reduces\nacute risks from cardiovascular disease and could reduce demands on the healthcare\nsystem[25]​. GPs and other healthcare providers can play a crucial role – brief, high-quality\nand free online training is available at https://www.ncsct.co.uk/vba.\n \nReferences\n1. a, b Wei-jie Guan, Zheng-yi Ni, Yu Hu, Wen-hua Liang, Chun-quan Ou, Jian-xing He.\n(2020).
