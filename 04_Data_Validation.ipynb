         "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible stress protein, confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function. Chronic, low-level, exogenous exposure to CO from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of CO in pulmonary medicine. The implications of the HO-1/CO system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review, with an emphasis on inflammatory states.",

         "The heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (HO-1/CO) system has recently seen an explosion of research interest due to its newly discovered physiological effects. This metabolic pathway, first characterized by Tenhunen et al. [1, 2] , has only recently revealed its surprising cytoprotective properties [3, 4] . Research in HO-1/CO now embraces the entire field of medicine where reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, inflammation, growth control, and apoptosis represent important pathophysiological mechanisms [3] [4] [5] [6] . Indeed, the number of publications in recent years concerning HO-1 has increased exponentially, while the list of diseases and physiological responses associated with changes in HO-1 continues to expand [5] . Until now, relatively few studies have addressed the role of HO-1/CO in pulmonary medicine. Several investigators have focused on the diagnostic application of the HO-1/CO system, by measuring exhaled CO (E-CO) in various pathological pulmonary conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7] . In another experimental approach, investigators have examined the expression of HO-1 in lung tissue from healthy or diseased subjects [8, 9] . This review will highlight the actions of HO-1/CO in the context of heme degradation have antioxidant properties [18, 19] . The liberated heme iron undergoes detoxification either by extracellular efflux or by sequestration into ferritin, an intracellular iron-storage molecule with potential cytoprotective function [20] [21] [22] [23] . Of the three known isoforms of HO (HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3), only HO-1 responds to xenobiotic induction [24] [25] [26] [27] . Constitutively expressed in many tissues, HO-2 occurs at high levels in nervous and vascular tissues, and may respond to regulation by glucocorticoids [25, 28, 29] . HO-1 and HO-2 differ in genetic origin, in primary structure, in molecular weight, and in their substrate and kinetic parameters [25, 26] . HO-3 displays a high sequence homology with HO-2 but has little enzymatic activity [27] . This review will focus on the inducible, HO-1, form. In addition to the physiological substrate heme, HO-1 responds to induction by a wide variety of stimuli associated with oxidative stress. Such inducing agents include hypoxia, hyperoxia, cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), heavy metals, ultraviolet-A (320-380 nm) radiation, heat shock, shear stress, hydrogen peroxide, and thiol (-SH)-reactive substances [3] . The multiplicity of toxic inducers suggest that HO-1 may function as a critical cytoprotective molecule [3, 4] . Many studies have suggested that HO-1 acts as an inducible defense against oxidative stress, in models of inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, hypoxia, and hyperoxia-mediated injury (reviewed in [3] ). The mechanisms by which HO-1 can mediate cytoprotection are still poorly understood. All three products of the HO reaction potentially participate in cellular defense, of which the gaseous molecule CO has recently received the most attention [30, 31] . The administration of CO at low concentrations can compensate for the protective effects of HO-1 in the presence of competitive inhibitors of HO-1 activity [32] [33] [34] . While HO-1 gene transfer confers protection against oxidative stress in a number of systems, clearly not all studies support a beneficial role for HO-1 expression. Cell-culture studies have suggested that the protective effects of HO-1 overexpression fall within a critical range, such that the excess production of HO-1 or HO-2 may be counterprotective due to a transient excess of reactive iron generated during active heme metabolism [35, 36] . Thus, an important caveat of comparative studies on the therapeutic effects of CO administration versus HO-1 gene delivery arises from the fact that the latter approach, in addition to producing CO, may have profound effects on intracellular iron metabolism. HO-1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. Genetic analyses have revealed two enhancer sequences (E1, E2) in the murine HO-1 gene located at -4 kb (E1) and -10 kbp (E2) of the transcriptional start site [37, 38] . These enhancers mediate the induction of HO-1 by many agents, including heavy metals, phorbol esters, endotoxin, oxidants, and heme. E1 and E2 contain repeated stress-responsive elements, which consist of overlapping binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein-1 (AP-1), v-Maf oncoprotein, and the cap'n'collar/basic-leucine zipper family of proteins (CNC-bZIP), of which Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor) may play a critical role in HO-1 transcription [39] . The promoter region of HO-1 also contains potential binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), though the functional significance of these are not clear [40] . Both NF-κB and AP-1 have been identified as regulatory elements responsive to oxidative cellular stress [40, 41] . In response to hyperoxic stress, AP-1 factors mediated the induction of HO-1 in cooperation with signal-transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins [41] . Furthermore, a distinct hypoxia-response element (HRE), which mediates the HO-1 response to hypoxia, represents a binding site for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [42] . The toxic properties of CO are well known in the field of pulmonary medicine. This invisible, odorless gas still claims many victims each year by accidental exposure. CO evolves from the combustion of organic materials and is present in smoke and automobile exhaust. The toxic actions of CO relate to its high affinity for hemoglobin (240-fold greater than that of O 2 ). CO replaces O 2 rapidly from hemoglobin, causing tissue hypoxia [43] [44] [45] . At high concentrations, other mechanisms of CO-induced toxicity may include apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of drug metabolism and respiratory enzyme functions [44] . Only recently has it become known that, at very low concentrations, CO participates in many physiological reactions. Where a CO exposure of 10,000 parts per million (ppm) (1% by volume CO in air) is toxic, 100-250 ppm (one hundredth to one fortieth as much) will stimulate the physiological effects without apparent toxicity [4] . The majority of endogenous CO production originates from active heme metabolism (>86%), though a portion may be produced in lipid peroxidation and drug metabolism reactions [46] . Cigarette smoking, still practiced by many lung patients, represents a major source of chronic lowlevel exposure to CO. Inhaled CO initially targets alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells. The exact mechanisms by which CO acts at the molecular level remain incompletely understood. CO potentially exerts its physiological effects by influencing at least three known pathways (Fig. 2 ). By complexation with the heme moiety of the enzyme, CO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), stimulating the production of cyclic 3':5'guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) [47] . The sGC/cGMP pathway mediates the effects of CO on vascular relaxation, smooth muscle cell relaxation, bronchodilation, neurotransmission, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation, coagulation, and smooth muscle proliferation [48] [49] [50] [51] . Furthermore, CO may cause vascular relaxation by directly activating calcium-dependent potassium channels [52] [53] [54] . CO potentially influences other intracellular signal transduction pathways. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which transduce oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling (i.e. response to lipopolysaccharide), may represent an important target Possible mechanism(s) of carbon monoxide action Figure 2 Possible mechanism(s) of carbon monoxide action. Endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) arises principally as a product of heme metabolism, from the action of heme oxygenase enzymes, although a portion may arise from environmental sources such as pharmacological administration or accidental exposure, or other endogenous processes such as drug and lipid metabolism. The vasoregulatory properties of CO, including its effects on cellular proliferation, platelet aggregation, and vasodilation, have been largely ascribed to the stimulation of guanylate cyclase by direct heme binding, leading to the generation of cyclic GMP. The anti-inflammatory properties of CO are associated with the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, dependent on the selective modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as the 38 kilodalton protein (p38MAPK). In addition to these two mechanisms, CO may potentially interact with any hemoprotein target, though the functional consequences of these interactions with respect to cellular signaling remain poorly understood. Anti-Platelet Aggregation Anti-Proliferation  ? Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production Modulation of hemoprotein function of CO action [32, 34, 55, 56 ]. An anti-apoptotic effect of CO and its relation to MAPK has recently been described. The overexpression of HO-1 or the exogenous administration of CO prevented tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)induced apoptosis in murine fibroblasts [57] . In endothelial cells, the anti-apoptotic effect of CO depended on the modulation of the p38 (38 kilodalton protein) MAPK pathway [34] . The role of the remaining heme metabolites, (i.e. Fe and biliverdin IXα) in the modulation of apoptosis is currently being investigated and is beyond the scope of this review. Recent studies have reported a potent anti-inflammatory effect of CO, involving the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production after endotoxin stimulation, dependent on the modulation of p38 MAPK [32] . The clinical relevance of p38 MAPK lies in the possibility of modulating this pathway in various clinical conditions to downregulate the inflammatory response [58] . Oxidative stress arising from an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants plays a central role in the pathogenesis of airway disease [59] . In lung tissue, HO-1 expression may occur in respiratory epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and to a large extent in alveolar macrophages [41, 60, 61] . HO-1 induction in these tissues, in vitro and in vivo, responds to common causes of oxidative stress to the airways, including hyperoxia, hypoxia, endotoxemia, heavy metal exposure, bleomycin, diesel exhaust particles, and allergen exposure [4, 41, 61] . Induction of HO-1 or administration of CO can protect cells from these stressful stimuli [10, 41] . In one of the experiments that best illustrate the protective role of CO in vivo, rats were exposed to hyperoxia (>98% O 2 ) in the absence or presence of CO at low concentration (250 ppm). The CO-treated rats showed increased survival and a diminished inflammatory response to the hyperoxia [11] . As demonstrated in a model of endotoxin-induced inflammation, the protection afforded by CO most likely resulted from the downregulated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IL-1β) and the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) [32] . Furthermore, increases in exhaled CO (E-CO) have been reported in a number of pathological pulmonary conditions, such as unstable asthma, COPD, and infectious lung disease; these increases may reflect increased endogenous HO-1 activity [7] . Elevated carboxyhemoglobin (Hb-CO) levels have also been reported in these same diseases in nonsmoking subjects, where both the E-CO and Hb-CO levels decrease to normal levels in response to therapy [62] . E-CO in humans originates primarily from both systemic heme metabolism, which produces CO in various tissues, and localized (lung) heme metabolism, as a result of the combined action of inducible HO-1 and constitutive HO-2 enzymatic activity. Endogenously produced or inspired CO is eliminated exclusively by respiration [63] . Elevation of E-CO may also reflect an increase in exogenous sources such as smoking or air pollution. In addition to changes in environmental factors, elevations of E-CO in lung diseases may reflect an increase in blood Hb-CO levels in response to systemic inflammation, as well as an increase in pulmonary HO-1 expression in response to local inflammation [9, 62, 64] . The diagnostic value of measuring E-CO remains controversial due to many conflicting reports (i.e. some reports indicate differences in E-CO measurements between disease activity and controls, and some reports do not). The possible explanations for these discrepancies include large differences in patient populations and in the methods used for measuring E-CO, and undefined corrections for background levels of CO. Furthermore, remarkable differences arise between studies in the magnitude of the E-CO levels in the control groups as well as in treated or untreated asthma patients. When active or passive smoking occurs, or in the presence of high background levels of CO, the measurement of E-CO is not particularly useful for monitoring airway inflammation. In patients who smoke, E-CO can be used only to confirm the smoking habit [65, 66] . Comparable to the beginning era of measurements of exhaled NO, a standardization in techniques and agreement on background correction should be reached for E-CO measurements, to allow proper conclusions to be drawn in this area of investigation. Asthma, a form of allergic lung disease, features an accumulation of inflammatory cells and mucus in the airways, associated with bronchoconstriction and a generalized airflow limitation. Inflammation, a key component of asthma, involves multiple cells and mediators where an imbalance in oxidants/antioxidants contributes to cell damage. Several pathways associated with oxidative stress may participate in asthma. For example, the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 control the expression of proinflammatory mediators [59, [67] [68] [69] . In light of the potential protective effects of HO-1/CO on inflammatory processes, the study of HO-1 in asthma has gained popularity. In a mouse model of asthma, HO-1 expression increased in lung tissue in response to ovalbumin aerosol challenge, indicating a role for HO-1 in asthma [70] . In a similar model of aeroallergen-induced asthma in ovalbumin-sensitized mice, exposure to a CO atmosphere resulted in a marked attenuation of eosinophil content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-5 [10] . This experiment showed that exogenous CO can inhibit asthmatic responses to allergens in mice. Recent human studies have revealed higher HO-1 expression in the alveolar macrophages and higher E-CO in untreated asthmatic patients than in healthy nonsmoking controls [71, 72] . Patients with exacerbations of asthma and patients who were withdrawn from inhaled steroids showed higher E-CO levels than steroid-treated asthmatics or healthy controls [73] . Higher levels of E-CO may also occur in children with persistent asthma than in healthy controls [74] . E-CO levels may correlate with functional parameters such as peak expiratory flow rate. A low rate in asthma exacerbations correlated with high E-CO, whereas normalization of the rate with oral glucocorticoid treatment resulted in a reduction of E-CO [75] . Furthermore, increased E-CO was associated with greater expression of HO-1 in airway alveolar macrophages obtained by induced sputum in untreated asthmatic patients than in controls. These asthma patients also showed higher bilirubin levels in the induced sputum, indicating higher HO activity [71] . Furthermore, patients with asthma show an increased Hb-CO level at the time of exacerbation, with values decreasing to control levels after oral glucocorticoid treatment [62] . In human asthmatics, E-CO and airway eosinophil counts decreased in response to a one-month treatment with inhaled corticosteroids [73] . In direct contrast to such studies promoting E-CO as a useful noninvasive tool for monitoring airway inflammation, other studies reported no difference in E-CO levels of asthma patients versus healthy controls, or between patients with stable and unstable asthma. In one such report, no further change in E-CO occurred in asthma patients after a one-month treatment of inhaled corticosteroids, despite observed decreases in airway eosinophil content and bronchial responsiveness to metacholine [76] . A recent study accentuates this finding in asthma excerbations, where no decrease in E-CO of children with asthma could be detected after oral prednisolone treatment [77] . In human allergic responses, results on elevation of E-CO are also inconclusive. A clear elevation of E-CO after allergen exposure occurred in patients with asthma during the late response, and during the early response immediately after the inhalation [78] . However, another report showed that no elevation of E-CO occurred in allergen-induced asthma within 48 hours after allergen challenge [79] . Finally, increases in E-CO were measured in allergic rhinitis, correlating with seasonal changes in exposure to allergen (pollen) [80] . Airway inflammation plays an important role in the development of COPD, characterized by the presence of macrophages, neutrophils, and inflammatory mediators such as proteinases, oxidants, and cytokines. Further-more, the inflammatory consequences of chronic microbiological infections may contribute to the progression of the disease. The current paradigm for the pathogenesis of COPD involves imbalances in protease/antiprotease activities and antioxidant/pro-oxidant status. Proteases with tissue-degrading capacity, (i.e. elastases and matrix metalloproteinases), when insufficiently inhibited by antiproteases, can induce tissue damage leading to emphysema. Oxidants that supersede cellular antioxidant defenses can furthermore inactivate antiproteases, cause direct injury to lung tissue, and interfere with the repair of the extracellular matrix. Smoking plays an important role in both hypotheses. Cigarette smoke will act primarily on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, which react to this oxidative stress by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and releasing growth factors. Nevertheless, smoking cannot be the only factor in the development of COPD, since only 15-20% of smokers develop the disease [81, 82] . Exposure to reactive oxygen species (from cigarette smoke or chronic infections) and an imbalance in oxidant/antioxidant status are the main risk factors for the development of COPD. To defend against oxidative stress, cells and tissues contain endogenous antioxidant defense systems, which include millimolar concentrations of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH). A close relation exists between GSH concentration and HO-1, whereby depletion of GSH augments the transcriptional regulation of HO-1 by oxidants, suggesting that the HO-1/CO system acts as a secondary defense against oxidative stress [83] [84] [85] [86] . Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that HO-1/ CO may also play an important part in COPD. Alveolar macrophages, which produce a strong HO-1 response to stimuli, may represent the main source of CO production in the airways [60, 64] . Patients with COPD have displayed higher E-CO than healthy nonsmoking controls [87] . Furthermore, much higher levels of HO-1 have been observed in the airways of smokers than in nonsmokers [64] . Among subjects who formerly smoked, patients with COPD have lower HO-1 expression in alveolar macrophages than healthy subjects [88] . A microsatellite polymorphism that is linked with the development of COPD may occur in the promoter region of HO-1, resulting in a lower production of HO-1 in people who have the polymorphism. Thus, a genetically dependent downregulation of HO-1 expression may arise in subpopulations, possibly linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress [89] [90] [91] . Future studies on both genetic predisposition and possible therapeutic modalities will reveal the involvement of the HO-1/CO system in COPD. Cystic fibrosis (CF) involves a deposition of hyperviscous mucus in the airways associated with pulmonary dysfunc-tion and pancreatic insufficiency, which may be accompanied by chronic microbiological infections. E-CO readings were higher in untreated versus oral-steroidtreated CF patients [92] . Furthermore, E-CO increased in patients during exacerbations of CF, correlating to deterioration of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), with normalization of the E-CO levels after treatment [93] . E-CO levels may correlate with exhaled ethane, a product of lipid peroxidation that serves as an indirect marker of oxidative stress. Both E-CO and exhaled ethane were higher in steroid-treated and untreated CF patients than in healthy controls [94] . E-CO was higher in children with CF than in control patients. In addition to the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to continuous infectious pressure in these patients, E-CO may possibly respond to hypoxia. E-CO increased further in CF children following an exercise test, and correlated with the degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, a finding suggestive of an increased HO-1 expression in CF patients during hypoxic states induced by exercise [95] . In patients with pneumonia, higher Hb-CO levels can be measured at the onset of illness, with values decreasing to control levels after antibiotic treatment [62] . E-CO levels were reported to be higher in lower-respiratory-tract infections and bronchiectasis, with normalization after antibiotic treatment [96, 97] . Furthermore, E-CO levels in upper-respiratory-tract infections were higher than in healthy controls [74, 80] . The relationship between higher measured E-CO in these infectious states and higher Hb-CO levels cannot be concluded from these studies. The role of HO-1 in the development of interstitial lung disease remains undetermined. Comparative immunohistochemical analysis has revealed that lung tissue of control subjects, patients with sarcoidosis, usual interstitial pneumonia, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia, all showed a high expression of HO-1 in the alveolar macrophages but a weak expression in the fibrotic areas [98] . The antiproliferative properties of HO-1 suggest a possible beneficial role in limiting fibrosis; however, this hypothesis is complicated by a newly discovered relation between IL-10 and HO-1. IL-10 produced by bronchial epithelial cells promotes the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts [99] . HO-1 expression and CO treatment have been shown to increase the production of IL-10 in macrophages following proinflammatory stimuli [32] . Conversely, IL-10 induces HO-1 production, which is apparently required for the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 [100] . A recent report clearly shows the suppression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by adenovirus-mediated HO-1 gene transfer and overexpression in C57BL/6 mice, involving the inhibition of apoptotic cell death [101] . Overall, more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of HO-1 in interstitial lung disease and its possible therapeutic implications. HO-1 action may be of great importance in solid tumors, an environment that fosters hypoxia, oxidative stress, and neovascularization. HO-1 may have both pro-and antagonistic effects on tumor growth and survival. HO-1 and CO cause growth arrest in cell-culture systems and thus may represent a potential therapeutic modality in modulating tumor growth [16] . The overexpression of HO-1 or administration of CO in mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma mouse models resulted in improved survival (>90%) as well as reduction in tumor size (>50%) [17] . Furthermore, HO-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas can be useful in identifying patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. High expression of HO-1 was detected in groups without lymph node metastasis in this report [102] . In contrast to growth arrest, HO-1 may protect solid tumors from oxidative stress and hypoxia, possibly by promoting neovascularization. In one study, zinc protoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of HO-1 enzyme activity, suppressed tumor growth [103] . CO may represent a critical mediator of the body's adaptive response to hypoxia, a common feature in pulmonary vascular disease [104] . Since CO can modulate vascular tone by inducing cGMP and large, calcium-dependent potassium channels, HO-1 and CO probably play important roles in pulmonary vascular diseases [54] . A NOmediated HO-1 induction occurred in the hepatopulmonary syndrome during cirrhosis, associated with enhancement of vascular relaxation [105] . In portopulmonary hypertension, elevated levels of cGMP and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in the vascular endothelium, and HO-1 expression in macrophages and bronchial epithelium have been described [106] . In transgenic mice models, ho-1 -/and ho-1 +/+ mice did not differ in their development of pulmonary hypertension following chronic hypoxia treatment, despite the development of right ventricular dilation and right myocardial infarction in ho-1 -/mice [107] . The preinduction of HO-1 protein with chemical inducers, however, prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension in the rat lung as a consequence of chronic hypoxia treatment [108] . Transgenic mice overexpressing HO-1 in the lung were resistant to hypoxia-induced inflammation and hypertension [109] . Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of HO-1 and CO in primary human lung vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension. Supplemental oxygen therapy is often used clinically in the treatment of respiratory failure. Exposure to high oxygen tension (hyperoxia) may cause acute and chronic lung injury, by inducing an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema [110, 111] . Hyperoxia-induced lung injury causes symptoms in rodents that resemble human acute respiratory distress syndrome [112] . Hyperoxia induced HO-1 expression in adult rats but apparently not in neonatal rats, in which the expression and activities of HO-1 and HO-2 are developmentally upregulated during the prenatal and early postnatal period [113] . Both HO-1 and HO-2 potentially influence pulmonary adaptation to high O 2 levels. In one example, the adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of HO-1 into rat lungs protected against the development of lung apoptosis and inflammation during hyperoxia [114] . In vitro studies showed that the overexpression of HO-1 in lung epithelial cells or rat fetal lung cells caused growth arrest and conferred resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell death [15, 16] . An oxygen-tolerant variant of hamster fibroblasts that moderately overexpressed HO-1 in comparison with the parent line resisted oxygen toxicity in vitro. The treatment of this oxygen-tolerant strain with HO-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the resistance to hyperoxia. In contrast, additional, vector-mediated, HO-1 expression did not further increase oxygen tolerance in this model [115] . In vivo studies with gene-deleted mouse strains have provided much information on the roles of HO-1 and HO-2 in oxygen tolerance. Dennery et al. demonstrated that heme oxygenase-2 knockout mice (ho-2 -/-) were more sensitive to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than wild-type mice [116] . In addition to the absence of HO-2 expression, however, the mice displayed a compensatory increase in HO-1 protein expression, and higher total lung HO activity. Thus, in this model, the combination of HO-2 deletion and HO-1 overexpression resulted in a hyperoxiasensitive phenotype. Recent studies of Dennery et al. have shown that HO-1-deleted (ho-1 -/-) mice were more resistant to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than the corresponding wild type [117] . The hyperoxia resistance observed in the ho-1 -/strain could be reversed by the reintroduction of HO-1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer [117] . In contrast, mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from ho-1 -/mice showed increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of hemin and H 2 O 2 and generated more intracellular reactive oxygen species in response to these agents [118] . Both ho-1 -/-and ho-2 -/strains were anemic, yet displayed abnormal accumulations of tissue iron. Specifically, ho-1 -/accumulated nonheme iron in the kidney and liver and had decreased total iron content in the lung, while ho-2 -/mice accumulated total lung iron in the absence of a compensatory increase in ferritin levels [116, 119] . The mechanism(s) by which HO-1 or HO-2 deletions result in accumulation of tissue iron remain unclear. These studies, taken together, have indicated that animals deficient in either HO-1 and HO-2 display altered sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. Aberrations in the distribution of intra-and extra-cellular iron, may underlie in part, the differential sensitivity observed [116, 117] . Otterbein et al. have shown that exogenous CO, through anti-inflammatory action, may protect the lung in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. The presence of CO (250 ppm) prolonged the survival of rats in a hyperoxic (>95% O 2 ) environment, and inhibited the appearance of markers of hyperoxia-induced lung injury (i.e. hemorrhage, fibrin deposition, edema, airway protein accumulation, and BALF neutrophil influx) [11] . Furthermore, in a mouse model, CO inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in mice induced by the hyperoxia treatment. Using genedeleted mice, Otterbein and colleagues also observed that the protection afforded by CO in this model, similar to a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of lung injury, depended on the p38 MAPK pathway (Otterbein et al., unpublished observation, as reviewed in [3] ). In direct contrast to these studies, the group of Piantadosi and colleagues reported no significant difference in the hyperoxia tolerance of rats at CO doses between 50 and 500 ppm [120] . In their model, CO did not alter the accumulation of fluid in the airway. Furthermore, CO, when applied in combination with hyperoxia, increased the activity of myeloperoxidase, a marker of airway neutrophil influx. This study also suggested that inhalation of CO (50-500 ppm) did not alter the expression of HO-1 or other antioxidant enzymes such as Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in vivo [120] . Furthermore, Piantadosi and colleagues were able to induce oxygen tolerance in rats and HO-1 expression with hemoglobin treatment, but this tolerance also occurred in the presence of HO inhibitors, thereby not supporting a role for HO activity in oxygen tolerance [121] . Although no consensus has been reached as to the protective role of CO inhalation and/or HO-1 induction in hyperoxic lung injury, human studies will be required to show if CO will supersede NO in providing a significant therapeutic benefit in the context of severe lung diseases [122] . While antioxidant therapies have been examined, until now no human studies exist on the role of HO-1 and CO in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [123] . Lung transplantation is the ultimate and often last therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. After lung transplantation, there remains an ongoing hazardous situation in which both acute and chronic graft failure, as well as complications of the toxic immunosuppressive regimen used (i.e. severe bacterial, fungal, and viral infections; renal failure; and Epstein-Barr-virus-related lymphomas), determine the outcome [124] . The development of chronic graft failure, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), determines the overall outcome after lung transplantation. OB, which may develop during the first months after transplantation, is the main cause of morbidity and death following the first half-year after transplantation, despite therapeutic intervention. Once OB has developed, retransplantation remains the only therapeutic option available [124, 125] . Little is known about the pathophysiological background of OB. The possible determinants of developing OB include ongoing immunological allograft response, HLADR mismatch, cytomegalovirus infection, acute rejection episodes, organ-ischemia time, and recipient age [125] . OB patients displayed elevated neutrophil counts in the BALF, and evidence of increased oxidant activity, such as increased methionine oxidation in BALF protein and decreases in the ratio of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in epithelial lining fluid. [126, 127] . So far, only very limited research data are available on the possible role for HO-1 in allograft rejection after lung transplantation. Higher HO-1 expression has been detected in alveolar macrophages from lung tissue in lung transplant recipients with either acute or chronic graft failure than in stable recipients [128] . The protective role of HO-1 against allograft rejection has been shown in other transplantation models, in which solid organ transplantation typically benefits from HO-1 modulation. A higher expression of protective genes such as HO-1 has been observed in episodes of acute renal allograft rejection [129] . Furthermore, the induction of HO-1 alleviates graft-versus-host disease [130] . Adenoviral-HO-1 gene therapy resulted in remarkable protection against rejection in rat liver transplants [131] . The upregulation of HO-1 protected pancreatic islet cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion, supporting an anti-apoptotic function of HO-1 [132, 133] . HO-1 may confer protection in the early phase after transplantation by inducing Th2-dependent cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, while suppressing interferon-γ and IL-2 production, as demonstrated in a rat liver allograft model [134] . Beneficial effects of HO-1 modulation have also been described in xenotransplantation models, in which HO-1 gene expression appears functionally associated with xenograft survival [135] . In a mouse-to-rat heart trans-plant model, the effects of HO-1 upregulation could be mimicked by CO administration, suggesting that HOderived CO suppressed the graft rejection [136] . The authors proposed that CO suppressed graft rejection by inhibition of platelet aggregation, a process that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction. HO-1 may also contribute to ischemic preconditioning, a process of acquired cellular protection against ischemia/ reperfusion injury, as observed in guinea pig transplanted lungs [137] . HO-1 overexpression provided potent protection against cold ischemia/reperfusion injury in a rat model through an anti-apoptotic pathway [138, 139] . The induction of HO-1 in rats undergoing liver transplantation with cobalt-protoporphyrin or adenoviral-HO-1 gene therapy resulted in protection against ischemia/ reperfusion injury and improved survival after transplantation, possibly by suppression of Th1-cytokine production and decreased apoptosis after reperfusion [140, 141] . Until now, no reports have addressed E-CO measurements in lung transplantation, where it is possible that differences in E-CO will be found in patients with acute and chronic allograft rejection. The evolution of CO in exhaled breath may serve as a general marker and diagnostic indicator of inflammatory disease states of the lung, though more research will be required to verify its reliability. Increases in exhaled CO presumably reflect changes in systemic and airway heme metabolic activity from the action of HO enzymes. Evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies indicates that HO-1 provides a protective function in many, if not all, diseases that involve inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the exploitation of HO-1 for therapeutic gain could be achieved through the modulation of HO-1 enzyme activity or its up-and downstream regulatory factors, either by gene transfer, pharmacological inducers, or direct application of CO by gas administration or chemical delivery [142] [143] [144] [145] . The CO-releasing molecules (transition metal carbonyls) developed by Motterlini et al. [144] show promise in the pharmacological delivery of CO for therapeutic applications in vascular and immune regulation. The CO-releasing molecules have been shown to limit hypertension in vivo and promote vasorelaxation in isolated heart and aortic rings [144] . Ultimately, the challenge remains in applying the therapeutic potentials of HO-1 to the treatment of human diseases. In vivo models of transplantation have shown that HO-1 gene therapy protects against allograft rejection [129, 134] . Given the toxic therapy that every transplant patient receives, especially after lung transplantation, the field of transplantation medicine may bring the first frontier for human applications of HO-1 gene therapy or exogenous CO administration. The potential use of inhalation CO as a clinical therapeutic in inflammatory lung diseases has also appeared on the horizon. In one promising study, an inhalation dose of 1500 ppm CO at the rate of 20 times per day for a week produced no cardiovascular side effects [146] . Cigarette smoking and CO inhalation at identical intervals produced comparable Hb-CO levels of approximately 5%. The question of whether or not CO can be used as an inhalation therapy will soon be replaced by questions of \"how much, how long, and how often?\" The fear of administering CO must be weighed against the severe toxicity of the immunosuppressive agents in current use, and the often negative outcome of solid organ transplantation.

         "Relevance of human metapneumovirus in exacerbations of COPD",
         "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma. Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum. It was not found in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. CONCLUSION: HMPV is only found in a very small number of patients with AE-COPD. However it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of AE-COPD because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely.",

         "Respiratory viruses play an important role in exacerbations of COPD and this has been increasingly recognised since the application of molecular detection methods [1, 2] . The most prevalent viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction so far were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza 3. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus first isolated from a dutch child with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [3] . World wide distribution is probable since it has been isolated in North HMPV has been recognized as a member of the Paramyxoviridae like RSV and it is not only associated with bronchiolitis in most cases, but also with pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma [14, 15] , diseases which share some features with COPD. Up to date reports about hMPV in adults are scarce. In a general Canadian population 14.8% of patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections were hMPV positive. Thirty-three percent of hMPV-infected patients were hospitalized and the hospitalization rates were significantly higher among patients below 5 years and those over 50 years of age [16] . In another prospective cohort of adults, hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses but also in 4.1% of asymptomatic subjects. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly [17] . HMPV infection can be severe since the virus was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . The role of hMPV in acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) has been studied recently in outpatients and only low frequencies have been observed [17, 19] . Up to now the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized with AE-COPD is unknown. Our aim was therefore to investigate the frequency of detection of hMPV in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to compare these results to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without COPD. Three different groups were studied. The first group consisted of hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD), the second group were subjects with stable COPD and the third group was composed of smokers without COPD. The groups were defined as previously published [20] . Briefly AE-COPD patients suffered from COPD as defined by GOLD [21] . Acute exacerbation was characterized by worsening in dyspnea, cough, and expectoration. A routine posterior-anterior chest radiograph was evaluated on admission by expert radiologists to exclude other other reasons for increased symptoms as pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchial carcinoma or congestive heart failure.Stable COPD patients did not have an exacerbation within the last 30 days prior to hospital admission and had no changes in therapy within the last 14 days (including inhaled and oral medication) and had been admitted for other medical reasons into departments of internal medicine other than pulmonary care. COPD subjects were recruited in a 2:1 ratio each month in order to prevent seasonal selection bias. Smokers have been smoking more than 10 pack-years, could have chronic symptoms like cough and phlegm but did not report dyspnea and did not have bronchial obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC>70%, FEV 1 >80% predicted). None of the smokers had a history of COPD or asthma, nor was using systemic or topic pulmonary medication. The smokers were recruited either from our smoking cessation initiative or by newspaper advertisement. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Ruhr-University of Bochum, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects before inclusion in the study. Clinical evaluation, spirometric tests, nasal lavage, induced sputum, specimen processing and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction were carried out as described by Rohde et al [2] . Elution volume was 100 µl. cDNA was generated with random-hexamer primers as previously published[2]. A hMPV-specific real-time RT-PCR designed and evaluated by Maertzdorf et al was used [22] . Primers and probe are localized within the nucleoprotein gene (NL-N) and the presence of a degenerate base within the probe allows detection of all four genetic lineages of hMPV. The assays were performed using the TaqMan ® PCR Core Kit. The final volume was 25 µl containing 500 nM of the forward primer (NL-N-forward (5'-CATATAAGCAT-GCTATATTAAAAGAGTCTC-3')), 250 nM of the reverse primer (NL-N-reverse (5'-CCTATTTCTGCAGCATATTTG-TAATCAG-3')) and 500 nM of the probe (NL-N-probe (5'-FAM-TGYAATGATGAGGGTGTCACTGCGGTTG-TAMRA-3', in which Y is either a C or a T residue). Nuclease-free water was used as negative control and a plasmid containing the N gene of hMPV (kindly provided by James Simon, VIRONOVATIVE, EUR Holding, Erasmus University Rotterdam) was used as a positive control in all PCR runs. Cycling parameters were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Amplification and detection of RNA from virus isolates or clinical specimens were performed using the GeneAmp ® 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The real-time PCR product was cloned with the QIAGEN ® PCR cloning kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and this standard plasmid DNA was used for absolute quantification of hMPV viral load. Calculations were performed as previously described for absolute quantification of RSV viral load [23] . The primary objective of this study was to compare the frequency of hMPV detection in respiratory specimens between COPD patients with or without an acute exacerbation and smokers without COPD. Continuous data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data were of non-parametrical distribution and results were expressed as median and range. Differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test. To further analyse significant differences between two individual groups a pair wise comparison by two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. All significance levels were set to 5%. Data were analysed and processed using SPSS Version 12.0 on a Windows XP operating system. A total of 229 subjects were investigated between October 1999 and June 2004: 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. The clinical characteristics and lung function measurements are summarized in table 1. FEV 1 , FEV 1 in % of predicted value and FEV 1 /FVC were normal in smokers, significantly decreased in stable COPD patients (all) and further significantly decreased in AE-COPD patients (all p < 0.05 compared to stable COPD and all p < 0.001 compared to smokers). HMPV could be detected in three subjects. All these subjects were AE-COPD patients. The prevalence of hMPV in AE-COPD patients was 2.3%. The virus was simultaneously detected in nasal lavage and induced sputum in one patient only. The viral load was about 100 times higher in nasal lavage than in induced sputum in this patient. Overall the viral load in nasal lavage was about 3.5 times higher compared to induced sputum (for details see table 2). The hMPV positive patients did not differ significantly from other AE-COPD patients when clinical parameters and lung function were analysed. hMPV was detected in the winter season only. The main finding of this controlled study investigating the incidence of hMPV in subjects with COPD and smokers without COPD is that this recently discovered respiratory virus was detectable only during exacerbation of COPD. The frequency of detection was very low but in positive cases the viral load was considerable. There was no detection in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. Recently Vicente et al [19] reported about the incidence of hMPV in 89 COPD patients. Five patients (5.5%) were hMPV positive. Two of these patients had to be transferred to hospital. Although this was not a controlled study and not all details of the study are available due to the fact that the data were published in form of a letter, these results support our findings. The incidence of hMPV in this and in our study is low compared to other respiratory viruses. In a similar previous study we found that Picornaviruses were detectable in 36% of AE-COPD patients, Influenza A in 25% and Respiratory syncytial virus in 22%[2]. There is another prospective cohort study of adults in which hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly from long term care facilities [17] . Unfortunately this report does not specify how many of the elderly patients suffered from COPD. In our asymptomatic smokers without COPD hMPV could not be detected. A recent study investigating nasal secretions from adults with and without respiratory illnesses found hMPV in 5 of 146 ill patient and in none of 158 control subjects, strongly supporting our data [24] . A further recent study found hMPV in two out of 111 adult patients (1.8%) who presented to the emergency department for AE-COPD during 2 winter/ spring seasons in Quebec, Canada, also in support of our findings [25] . In a US American study investigating clinical samples collected between 1991 and 1995, hMPV could not be detected at all in 196 patients indicating important geographical and seasonal differences in hMPV prevalence [26] . Taken together the results presented here are in keeping with other studies in adults and add important information on the prevalence of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. To our knowledge this is the first study analysing the viral load of hMPV in COPD patients. We found a mean of 6.5 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in induced sputum. These values indicate that hMPV may have been the infectious agent triggering exacerbation in these patients. Viral load cut-off values for infectivity in COPD exacerbations have not been studied in detail yet and need further investigation. However, viral loads between 1120 copies/ml in Cytomegalovirus infection in lung-transplant patients [27] and 5.8log 10 copies/ ml in SARS [28] have been considered to indicate infectious disease. Moreover hMPV was only found in acute exacerbation and not in stable disease or in smokers without COPD supporting a triggering role in AE-COPD. HMPV infection can be severe since it was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . Our hMPV positive patients did not differ in their clinical characteristics or lung function from the other AE-COPD patients which does not indicate a more severe course of AE-COPD in these patients. Taken together this is the first controlled study on the relevance of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. HMPV was detected in a very low frequency but with noticeable viral load in AE-COPD patients. Given that asymptomatic carriage of hMPV is very unlikely it should be considered as another possible trigger of AE-COPD. Since every AE-COPD has considerable impact on the course of the disease and regional outbreaks of hMPV are possible it should be included into future diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.  The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."

         "Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey",
         "BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.",

         "In Japan, cancer has been recognized as a major component of the overall pattern of disease for decades. Thus, the importance of cancer prevention by lifestyle modification should now be strongly acknowledged. Internationally, several studies have estimated the proportion of total cancer deaths attributable to various risk factors based on epidemiologic evidence [1, 2] , and various international guidelines and recommendations derived from these have appeared [3] [4] [5] [6] . Not surprisingly, domestic guidelines and recommendations for cancer prevention in Japan such as the 'Twelve recommendations for cancer prevention [7]' and 'Healthy People Japan 21 [8] ' have been significantly influenced by these reports. Public awareness of risk factors in relation to cancer prevention has been surveyed in only a few countries [9, 10] , and results have demonstrated poor awareness. Other studies focusing on specific cancers only have also appeared [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, none of these studies quantitatively evaluated public awareness of the attributable fraction of individual risk factors. In Japan, it appears that most people are aware of the major risk factors of cancer. Although we are unaware of any published evidence, however, public knowledge and information on cancer prevention now seems influenced largely by the mass media and other sources, rather than by information provided directly by health professionals, resulting in a distorted picture of causation. Cancer control policy therefore urgently requires a clarification of the discrepancies which now exist between ideal levels of public concern about risk factors and the current reality, particularly public health policy makers in their formulation of cancer control measures. To address this need, the present study was designed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. Since we are interested in quantitatively estimating the awareness of preventability, we placed special emphasis on gauging awareness by attributable fraction of cancer. The study was conducted as a part of an omnibus survey in December, 2003, by commission to a polling agency. The omnibus survey is a monthly multipurpose cross-sectional survey which includes public opinion research, social research, scientific research, market research, and others. Using a stratified two-stage sampling method, a total of 2,000 people aged 20 or older were randomly selected as study subjects, from 160 districts selected from area units representing 12 geographical blocks (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Keihin, Koshinetu, Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Hanshin, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu) and 3 types of city scale (14 metropolises, other cities, towns and villages) in proportion to the population distribution as at March 2002. After an initial visit to obtain oral informed consent and schedule a visit for the interview, the survey was conducted by face-to-face interview using trained interviewers in each district. The omnibus survey does not collect any personally identifiable information such as name, date of birth or address details at interview. For the present report, we obtained the electronic data file for the relevant interview component, with no personal identifiers. Ethical approval was not applicable to the present study under the Japanese ethical guidelines for epidemiologic studies, which comply with the declaration of Helsinki. Among the 2,000 people selected for survey (977 men, 1,023 women), interviews were successfully obtained The questionnaire of this survey comprised questions on the awareness of various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention by enquiring about the attributable fraction of cancer. Fractions were: 1) 12 risk factor candidates, namely alcoholic beverages, unbalanced diet, use of food additives and pesticide chemicals, charred fish and meat, tobacco smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, air pollution such as diesel emissions, occupational exposure, cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection, and stress; 2) genetic factors in general; and 3) the preventable fraction of cancer occurrence by lifestyle modification [see Additional file 1]. The first question asked about the preventable fraction of cancer which would result in Japan if each factor were completely and totally eliminated, using the fine categories of <5%, 5 to <10%, 10 to <15%, 15 to <20%, 20 to <25%, 25 to <30%, 30 to <40%, 40 to <50%, 50 to <60%, 60 to <70%, 70 to <80%, 80 to <90%, and 90 to 100%. These categories were exhibited together on a pie chart. These risk factor candidates were selected with reference to previous international and domestic recommendations and guidelines [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The second question asked about the fraction of cancer genetically predetermined using the same categories as the first, while the third asked about the preventable fraction of cancer by modification of lifestyle using estimation of an actual percent value. In addition to these questions, subjects were also asked about their smoking and drinking practices, and occupational and educational status. Mean values of the attributable fractions were calculated for each risk factor of cancer and compared by demographic and habitual smoking and drinking status. For analyses, the mid-values of each category were assigned for categorical variables. All analyses were performed using Stata statistical software, S/E Version 8 [15] . A total of 1,355 (67.8%) subjects responded to the survey, with a higher response rate in women (72.9%) than in men (62.3%). Response rate was lower in the 20s age strata than in the other age groups, but no trend to an increase in response rate with increasing age was observed. Overall, no significant difference in area and age distribution was seen between the sampled population and survey respondents. Response rate tended to be lower among subjects who reside in the Kanto region and in cities other than the 14 metropolises than among other subjects ( Table 1) . Characteristics of the 1,355 respondents (609 men, 746 women) are presented in Table 2 . The proportion of current smokers was 44% in men and 15% in women, and decreased with age in both genders. In female subjects aged in their 20s, 26% currently smoke and 49% drink alcohol beverages at least 4 times a week. Awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population is presented in Table 3 . Among the 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction was considered highest for cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection (51.3%), followed by tobacco smoking (43.0%), stress (39.0%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37.1%). In contrast, the attributable fraction of charred fish and meat (21.4%) and alcohol drinking (21.7%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. The attributable fraction of other risk factor candidates such as occupational exposure, air pollution, food additives and pesticides, unbalanced diet, obesity and physical activity ranked between the high and low fractions. The attributable fraction responses tended to be higher in women than in men, and were increased among inhabitants of larger cities and in homemakers and decreased in those engaged in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, risk factor candidate rankings were similar by gender, age group, city scale, and educational and occupational status. In men, those who neither smoke nor drink tended to consider the preventive fraction of the risk factors higher than those who both smoke and drink, whereas in women, the former subjects considered the values lower than the latter. The speculated fraction of cancer which is genetically determined was 31.5% as an average (Table 3 ). This fraction was higher in current heavy smokers and former drinkers, and lower in homemakers and students. On the other hand, an average 35.5% of cancer were considered preventable by lifestyle improvement, with this ratio being higher in homemakers, former smokers, and never and former drinkers. The present survey, targeted at the Japanese general population, showed that the attributable fraction of cancer among Japanese tended to be higher for cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives than major lifestyle factors such as dietary factors. In addition, the attributable fraction of cancer estimated by the Japanese general population was higher than that derived from epidemiologic evidence in the West, which is frequently quoted as 30% for tobacco smoking and 30% for food as a whole [1, 2] . Some of the major cancers in Japan, including gastric and liver cancers, are known to be related to cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection, and a higher level of concern about such infection among Japanese than in Western populations would therefore be understandable [9] . Notwithstanding the validity of such concern, however, the high level of concern for infection, as well as for endocrine-disrupting chemicals, identified in the present survey was most likely due to the severe acute respiratory Likewise, a high level of concern for tobacco smoking was also observed, in spite of a relatively dull reduction in the rate of male current smokers in past decades compared with the U.S. This was probably due to recent enactment of the Health Promotion Law, which curbs passive smoking in public spaces. Respondent estimates for attributable fractions were generally high. This may be in part due to anchoring and adjustment effects of the response categories used and the tendency of people to respond near the middle of the scale. Given that responses tended to be generally high, concern over the present results should probably be focused on rankings rather than absolute values per se. Although tobacco smoking ranked among the top factors, risk factor candidates whose actual contribution is considered to be low, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, occupational exposure, air pollution such as diesel emissions and the use of food additives and pesticide chemicals ranked higher than previous estimates of the attributable fraction of cancer causes [1, 2] . In contrast, this should be compared with the results for unbalanced diet, which ranked at only 8th among the 12 risk factor candidates despite an actual ranking which is estimated to be as high as that for tobacco smoking. Particularly in light of findings on long-term exposure to common lifestyle factors such as diet as a cause of cancer, these results suggest that public awareness of cancer prevention is still insufficient. We are unaware of any previous studies aimed at determining public awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer as a whole or at gauging the level the awareness of cancer prevention by attributable fraction. Accordingly, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to discover the level of awareness for each risk factor candidate, and the questionnaire used has hence not been fully validated. In addition, as indicated above, responses to this type of cross sectional survey are subject to social conditions such as information from the mass media and other sources on disease epidemics and other putative risk factors. Thus, the results might not necessarily reflect actual public awareness. However, the study subjects were recruited from among a nationally representative random sample, and the response rate was similar to that of recent omnibus surveys in other countries [16] [17] [18] [19] . Nevertheless, the exclusion of non-respondents may have distorted the results. In conclusion, awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population tended to be dominated by infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than dietary factors. The results of the present survey provide valuable clues and perspectives toward the formulation of relevant cancer prevention strategies in Japan."

         "Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung",
         "To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.",

         "A. miRNA definition, biology and function Discovery of microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 was the first short non-coding RNA discovered in 1993 as a regulator of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans [1] . The first non-coding RNA identified in humans was let-7, which has been found involved in the control of developmental timing in humans and animals [2, 3] . Soon it became evident that these short non-coding RNAs are a part of much larger class of non-coding RNAs and the term microRNA (miRNA) was introduced [4] . To date, more than 900 miRNAs in Homo sapiens have been identified (940 in miRBase v15). MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs~22 nucleotides (nt) long involved in the negative post-transcriptional gene regulation via RNA interference mechanism [5, 6] . The sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among plants-microorganisms-animals, suggesting that miRNAs represent a relatively old and important regulatory pathway [7] . MiRNAs belong to the most abundant class of human gene regulators [8] : up to a third of the human genes are regulated by miRNAs [9] . MiRNAs are, therefore, key regulators of numerous genes in biological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis [e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ]. It has been speculated that miRNAs may be associated with the regulation of almost every aspect of cell physiology [8] . MiRNA genes are localized in the non-coding regions or in the introns of protein-coding genes in the genomic DNA. The miRNA genes are much longer than biologically active, mature miRNAs which originate through a multistep process [15] (Figure 1 ). Briefly, transcription by the RNA polymerase II leads to hundred or thousand nucleotides long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) [16] . A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/ Pasha to 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) [17] in a process known as \"cropping\" [18, 19] . Pre-miRNAs are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [20, 21] . In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes [17, 20] . One strand of the short-lived miRNA duplex is degraded (\"passenger\" strand, miR*), whereas the other (\"guide\", miR) strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA [8] . Selection of the \"guide\" strand is based on the base pairing stability of both dsRNA ends [22, 23] . Depending on the complementarity between miRNA and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA there are two known mechanisms of miRNAs action on mRNAs: 1) target mRNA degradation and 2) translational inhibition with little or no influence on mRNA levels [24] (Figure 2) . Firstly, the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of the target mRNA occurs when miRNA is near-perfectly complementary with target mRNA [25, 26] . A recent study proved that mRNA degradation represents the major mechanism of miRNA regulation [27] . The authors showed that about 84% of all protein-coding mRNA targets undergo degradation while recognized by their cognate miRNA [27] . Secondly, the translational inhibition MiRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from the genomic DNA as long (hundred or thousand nucleotides) primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/Pasha to produce a 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs in form of hairpins are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes, consisting of the \"guide\" (miR) strand and the \"passenger\" (miR*) strand. The \"passenger\" strand is degraded, the \"guide\" strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA, acting by two different mechanisms according to the complementarity with the target mRNA. Adopted from Kim [15] . occurs when miRNA is only partially complementary to its target mRNA [28] [29] [30] . In light of the recent study by Guo et al [27] , this mechanism does not represent a predominant reason for reduced protein output. Besides the complementarity between miRNA and mRNA, several other factors may influence the miRNA action such as impaired processing, methylation, gene polymorphisms, gene amplification, deletion of Dicer, translocations and others [31] . It is evident that single miRNAs may regulate translation of numerous downstream mRNAs and each mRNA is likely to be regulated by several miRNAs simultaneously [30, 32] . Thus, identification of miRNA target genes has been a great challenge [33] . Numerous computational algorithms [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] were established which combined 5' seed matches, thermodynamic stability and conservation analysis in order to maximize specificity when predicting mRNA targets [44] (Table 1) . Nevertheless, various algorithms differ in the selection of mRNA targets and simultaneous application of several algorithms is, therefore, highly recommended. Nowadays, many web-based applications [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] have been developed by combining existing prediction programs with functional annotations associated to many miRNA, gene, protein or biological pathway resources such as miR-Base, Ensembl, Swiss-Prot, UCSC genome browser, KEGG pathway and other databases [44] (Table 2) . However, because of high similarities in miRNA sequences, computational algorithms may predict a large number of putative miRNA binding sites on mRNA targets [33] . Thus, experimental validation in biological system is fundamental to complete the target prediction [44] ; the currently available methods [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] are listed in Table 3 . Of these, antagomir studies or immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs have been specifically developed for miRNA-mRNA studies. Antagomirs represent a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides used to silence endogenous microRNAs [64, 65] . Immunoprecipitation is then based on the observation that each member of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family (catalytic components of the RNA-induced silencing complex) can bind to miRNAs and to partially complementary sequences in the 3'-UTR of specific target mRNAs. Thus, using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against members of the Ago protein family, Ago-bound mRNAs can be co-immunoprecipitated [66, 67] . The lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile, highly conserved across mammalian species [68, 69] . However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung compartment is still limited and it is based mainly on the studies in animal models. MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in 1) the lung development and homeostasis, 2) in inflammation and viral infections and 3) miRNA deregulation may contribute to several pulmonary diseases ( Figure 3 ). Hereby, we summarize the knowledge of the involvement of miRNAs in the lung and current information on their posttranscriptional regulation ongoing in the lung compartment. Besides pathology we pay attention also to physiological lung because understanding miRNA function in normal condition is prerequisite to description of its involvement in disease. Several miRNAs such as miR-155, miR-26a, let-7, miR-29, miR-15/miR-16, miR-223, miR-146a/b and the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to be involved in homeostasis and in the lung development ( Table 4 ). The pulmonary role of miR-155 was studied in murine lung, where it has been shown that miR-155 is crucially involved in the differentiation of naive T-cells into Th1 and Th2 cells [70, 71] . Mice deficient in bic/miR-155 became immunodeficient and displayed increased lung remodelling, higher bronchoalveolar leukocytes and impaired T-and B-cell responses to inflammatory stimuli [70] . Another member of miRNA family, miR-26a, has been shown to be selectively expressed in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in murine lung [72] . Target mRNA of miR-26a is the transcription factor SMAD1, which is involved in the regulation of bone morphogenic protein signalling during lung development and pulmonary vascular remodelling [73, 74] . Thus, miR-26a might be important in controlling essential developmental and physiological events in the lung [75] . Also the miR-17-92 cluster is believed to regulate the lung development because its expression is high in embryonic development and steadily declines through development into adulthood [76] . Mice deficient in the miR-17-92 cluster died shortly after birth and lung hypoplasia/ventricular septal defects were demonstrated; moreover the absence of the miR-17-92 cluster let to upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and inhibition of B-cell development [77] . On the other side, the overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster in murine models resulted in an abnormal phenotype manifested by absence of terminal air sacs, which were replaced by highly proliferative, undifferentiated pulmonary epithelium [76] . Other miRNAs found to be involved in the pulmonary homeostasis are members of let-7 family [78] , miR-29 [79] , miR-15 and miR-16 [80, 81] , which Northern blot analysis [54] Quantitative real-time PCR [55] Ribonuclease protection assay [56] in situ hybridization [57] , [58] miRNA mimics [59] Western blot [60] Immunocytochemistry [61] Bead-based flow cytometry method [62] Suppression of miRNA expression in cells by antisense locked-nucleic acid oligonucleotides [63] Antagomir assays [64] , [65] Immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs [66] , [67] function as tumor suppressors in lung cells. In addition, another miRNA, miR-223, has been shown to be crucial for normal granulocyte development and function in the lung [82] . MiR-223 mutant mice spontaneously developed neutrophilic lung inflammation with tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge [82] . Two miRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b, have been shown to play central role in the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation; the mechanism is down-regulation of two proteins IRAK1 and TRAF6 involved in Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) signalling [83, 84] . Also other miRNAs have been shown to regulate the inflammation in mouse lung exposed to aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS): miR-21, -25, -27b, -100, -140, -142-3p, -181c, -187, -194, -214, -223 and -224 [72] . Increase in these miRNAs correlated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as TNFα [72] . The deregulation of miR-155, the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-223, miRNAs involved in lung development and homeostasis, resulted in the uncontrolled lung inflammation in murine models [70, 77, 82] . Based on the studies in murine models, there is evidence that miRNA expression may influence also the course of pulmonary viral infections [85, 86] . MiR-200a and miR-223 were detected in lethal influenza virus infection presumably contributing to the extreme miR-155 important for normal lung airway remodelling (A) [70] alteration of T-cell differentiation (A) [71] miR-26a highly expressed within bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, important for lung development (H) [75] let-7 highly expressed in normal lung tissue, functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [78] miR-29 functions as tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [79] miR-15, miR-16 function as tumor suppressor genes (H) [80] , [81] miR-223 control of granulocyte development and function (A) [82] miR-146a/b central to the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation (H) [83] , [84] miR-200a, miR-223 contribution to the extreme virulence of the r1918 influenza virus (A) [85] miR-17 family, miR-574-5p, miR-214 upregulated at the onset of SARS infection (A, H) [86] virulence of the r1918 influenza virus [85] . MiR-17 family, miR-574-5p and miR-214 were upregulated at the onset of SARS infection: these miRNAs may help the virus to evade the host immune system and are responsible for effective transmission at the initial stage of viral infection [86] . There is evidence that upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs is critical for the lung development/homeostasis and thus may contribute to development of pathological pulmonary conditions, namely to smokingrelated diseases including lung cancerogenesis, fibrosis, and other immune-mediated disorders including allergy (Table 5) . Recent studies have implicated the miRNAs in the pathogenesis of immune system mediated pulmonary diseases. Tan and colleagues [87] described that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-G, a known asthma-susceptibility gene, disrupts the binding sites of three miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-148b, miR-152) targeting this gene. Thus, it is likely that the association of the HLA-G gene to asthma-susceptibility may be due to the allele-specific regulation of this gene by miRNAs [87] . MiR-21 is a further miRNA crucially involved in allergic lung inflammation. Its molecular target is IL-12p35, a cytokine contributing to polarization of Th cells toward Th2 cells [88] . MiR-126 is another miRNA found to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airways disease [89] . The blockade of miR-126 suppressed the asthmatic phenotype leading to diminished Th2 responses, suppression of inflammation, reduced airways hyperresponsiveness, inhibition of eosinophil recruitment, and lower mucus hypersecretion [89] . In bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα, let-7, miR-29a and miR-155 have been involved in the regulation of allergic inflammation [90] . Multiple members of let-7 family were also found upregulated in experimental asthma model and the pro-inflammatory role of let-7 miRNAs on the allergic cytokine expression was confirmed [91] . Another study showed that expression of RhoA in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs), a new target for asthma therapy, is negatively regulated by miR-133a [92] . The same group later revealed that IL-13 is capable of reducing the miR-133a expression in BSMCs and that the miR-133a downregulation causes an Table 5 MiRNAs involved in pathological processes in the lung miRNA Function (A animal studies, H human studies) References miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster deregulation results in uncontrolled inflammation (A) [70] , [71] , [77] miR-21, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-181c, miR-223, miR-224 increased following exposure to LPS (A) [72] miR-155 overexpressed in solid tumors, inhibition of tumor suppressor genes (A, H) [81] miR-223 impaired granulocyte function, regulator of granulocyte production and inflammatory response (A) [82] miR-148a/b, miR-152 allele-specific regulation of asthma susceptibility HLA-G gene (H) [87] miR-21 key role in asthma (A) [88] overexpressed in solid malignancies (A, H) [103] up-regulated in bleomycin-induced fibrosis and IPF (A, H) [110] miR-126 suppression of the asthmatic phenotype by blockade of miR-126 (A) [89] downregulated in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (H) [111] let-7, miR-29a, miR-155 regulation of allergic inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells (A, H) [90] let-7 pro-inflammatory effect in experimental asthma (A) [91] role in lung cancer progression (H) [99] miR-133a regulator of expression of RhoA, target for asthma therapy (A, H) [92] , [93] miR-146a reduced expression in COPD fibroblasts (H) [95] miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294 deregulated due to smoking (A, H) [96, 97] miR-218 tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (H) [98] miR-17-92 cluster overexpressed in lung cancers (H) [102] miR-34 regulation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells (H) [105] [106] [107] miR-210 overexpressed in lung cancer (H) [108] let-7d pro-fibrotic effect in pulmonary fibrosis (A, H) [109] upregulation of RhoA, presumably resulting in an augmentation of the contraction [93] . Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure [94] . Although extensive studies of the involvement of miRNAs in lung cancer have been performed, there are only few reports focused on the role of miRNAs in COPD. Recent study on fibroblasts from COPD subjects stimulated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines released less miR-146a than smokers without COPD [95] . The reduced miR-146a expression resulted in prolonged mRNA half-life of cyclooxygenase-2, thus increasing prostaglandin E2 in fibroblasts from COPD subjects [95] . There is evidence that smoking has influence also on other miRNAs. Expression profiling study in the rats exposed to environmental cigarette smoke revealed 24 downregulated miRNAs (especially let-7 family, miR-10, [96] . MiR-294, a known inhibitor of transcriptional repressor genes, was the only miRNA upregulated in smoke-exposed rats [96] . In another study, bronchial airway epithelial cells from current and never smokers differed in the expression of 28 miRNAs (especially miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294) in comparison to smokers, whereas the majority of deregulated miRNAs were downregulated in smokers [97] . Similar observation was observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where downregulation of miR-218 was associated with a history of cigarette smoking [98] . However, the majority of miRNA studies in smokingrelated diseases are focused on the role of miRNAs in lung cancer. Altered expression of miR-155 and let-7 has been reported in lung adenocarcinoma and expression of let-7 related to patient survival [99] . Moreover, it has been shown that let-7 may also play a role in lung cancer progression [99] [100] [101] . Further, increased expression of the miR-17-92 cluster has also been detected in lung cancer [102] . Another miRNAs involved in lung cancerogenesis are miR-21 and miR-34 families. MiR-21 was shown to regulate multiple tumor/metastasis suppressor genes in lung solid tumors [103] . MiR-34a/b/c have been identified to be a component of the p53 tumor suppressor network: p53 upregulates in response to DNA damage the members of miR-34 family [104] , thus regulating genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis [105] [106] [107] . Furthermore, miR-210 has been overexpressed in late stages of lung cancer, thus mediated mitochondrial alterations associated with modulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity [108] . Next, miR-218 was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer [98] . Recently, it was reported that miRNAs may play pivotal regulatory role also in the fibrotic processes ongoing in the lung: the downregulation of let-7 d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in the pro-fibrotic effects [109] . Also, upregulation of miR-21 was reported in the lungs of IPF patients and in the murine lungs with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas miR-21 expression was enhanced by pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 [110] . Another disease associated with miRNA change was cystic fibrosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was detected in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and its expression correlated with upregulation of TOM1 mRNA both in vitro and in vivo [111] . TOM1, a miR-126 target, was reported to be involved in the regulation of innate immune responses through its involvement in the TLR2/4 and IL-1β and TNF-α-induced signalling pathways [111] . Small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal role in the posttranscriptional regulation of numerous human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. There is evidence that the lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile undergoing changes during the lung development. Studies namely in animal models have provided evidence that miRNAs participate in lung homeostasis and play pivotal role also in the control of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections. Recent studies showed evidence that upregulated or downregulated expression of various miRNAs play an active role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Specific miRNA expression profiles were characterized for smoking related-diseases including COPD and lung cancer, immune-mediated pulmonary diseases and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, several miRNAs crucial for lung development and homeostasis such as let-7, miR-155 or miR-19-72 cluster have been identified to be deregulated in pulmonary allergy, asthma or lung cancer. The knowledge of altered miRNA expression profiles in diseased lung may thus offer new insights in the biology of pulmonary diseases. Moreover, miRNAs may represent attractive novel diagnostic biomarkers mainly due to their higher stability when compared to mRNAs [112] and could potentially provide possibilities for therapeutic intervention [31, 113, 114] ."

         "Genetic material in plants is distributed into nucleus, plastids and mitochondria. Plastid has a central role of carrying out photosynthesis in plant cells. Plastid transformation is becoming more popular and an alternative to nuclear gene transformation because of various advantages like high protein levels, the feasibility of expressing multiple proteins from polycistronic mRNAs, and gene containment through the lack of pollen transmission. Recently, much progress in plastid engineering has been made. In addition to model plant tobacco, many transplastomic crop plants have been generated which possess higher resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and molecular pharming. In this mini review, we will discuss the features of the plastid DNA and advantages of plastid transformation. We will also present some examples of transplastomic plants developed so far through plastid engineering, and the various applications of plastid transformation.",

         "Genetic material in plants is distributed into nucleus and the chloroplast and mitochondria in the cytoplasm. Each of these three compartments carries its own genome and expresses heritable traits [1, 2] . The chloroplast is one of organelles known as plastids in plant cells and eukaryotic algae [3] . According to Verhounig et al. [4] , plastids and mitochondria are derived from formerly free-living bacteria and have largely prokaryotic gene expression machinery. The plastid (biosynthetic centre of the plant cell) carries out photosynthesis, in plant cells and eukaryotic algae, which provides the primary source of the world's food [3] . There are other important activities that occur in plastids. These include sequestration of carbon, production of starch, evolution of oxygen, synthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, and pigments, and key aspects of sulfur and nitrogen metabolism [5] . In spite of the prokaryotic past of the plastids, their gene expression has very different regulatory mechanisms from those operating in bacteria [6] . There are up to 300 plastids [7] in one plant cell. The plastid genome (plastome or plastid DNA, ptDNA), 1,000-10,000 copies per cell [8] , contrasts strikingly with the nuclear DNA. In most species, plastids are usually strictly maternally inherited [9] in most (80%) angiosperm plant species [10, 11] . It is also not influenced by polyploidy, gene duplication and recombination that are widespread features of the nuclear genomes of plants [12, 13] . Therefore, ptDNA varies little among angiosperms in terms of size, structure and gene content [14] . Currently 170 DNA. The authors, therefore, developed a simple and inexpensive method to obtain plastid DNA from grass species by modifying and extending protocols optimized for the use in eudicots. Plastid engineering involves the targeting of foreign genes to the plastid's double-stranded circular DNA genome instead of chromosomal DNA [31] , and as a consequence the production of the foreign protein of interest (Fig.  1) . The advancement in the particle gun mediated transformation has enabled targeting the plastid genome for developing transgenic plants against many biotic (e.g. insects and pathogens) and abiotic stresses (e.g. drought and salinity), which reduce the plant productivity. Improving the quality of fruits has been another main target in plastid transformation [32] . Plastid transformation was first achieved in a unicellular alga, Chlamydomonas reindhartii [33] . In 1990, Sváb et al. [34] reported the first successful chloroplast transformation of a higher plant (tobacco). This was followed by transformation of the plastid genome in tobacco by many researchers [35, 36] . Recently, tobacco plastid has been engineered to express the E7 HPV type 16 protein, which is an attractive candidate for anticancer vaccine development [37] . Similarly, a protocol for plastid transformation of an elite rapeseed cultivar (Brassica napus L.) has been developed [38] . Brassica napus - [132] Citrus sinensis 155,189 [133] Coffea arabica - [134] Cucumis sativus 155,293 [135] Daucus carota 155,911 [136] Ficus sp. - [137] Glycine max 152,218 [138] Gossypium barbadense 160,317 [139] Gossypium hirsutum 160,301 [140] Helianthus annuus 151,104 [141] Hordeum vulgare, Sorghum bicolor - [142] Lycopersicon esculentum 155,460 [21] Manihot esculenta - [143] Morus indica 156,599 [144] Musa acuminata - [145] Nicotiana tabacum 155,943 [146] Oryza sativa 134,551 [15] Oryza nivara 134,494 [16] Phaseolus vulgaris 150,285 [147] Saccharum officinarum 141,182 [18] Solanum tuberosu 155,298 [148] Spinacia oleracea 150,725 [149] Triticum aestivum 134,545 [19, 20] Vitis vinifera 160,928 [150] Zea mays 22,784 [17] Jatropha curcas 163,856 [151] Vigna radiata 151,271 [22] More recently, a method for plastid transformation in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) has been reported with pPRV111A plastid expression vector carrying the aadA gene encoding aminoglycoside 300-adenylyltransferase [26] . The authors believe that this may open up exciting possibilities to introduce and express novel genes in the engineered plants via plastid transformation for agronomic or pharmaceutical traits. Up to date, plastid transformation has been extended to many other higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana [39] , potato [40, 41] , tomato [1, 42] , Lesquerella fendleri, a kind of oilseed Brassicaceae [43] , oilseed rape, [38, 44] , petunia [45] , lettuce [46] , soybean [47] , cotton [48] , carrot [49] , rice [50] , poplar [51] , tobacco, [28, 52, 53] , mulberry , [54] and eggplant [26] (see review written by Wang et al. [3] ). Two interesting applications of plastid transformation were carried out by (i) [55] for the construction of a tobacco master line to improve Rubisco engineering in plastids, and (ii), [4] who explored the possibility of engineering riboswitches (natural RNA sensors that regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding) to function as translational regulators of gene and transgene expression in plastids. The dominant trait that attracted the most attention for plastid transformation has been herbicide tolerance [28, 35, 56, 57] . Roudsari et al. [28] revealed the production of high level glyphosate tolerant plants (N. tabacum) through biolistic transformation of plastids by introduction of a mutated herbicide-tolerant gene coding for EPSP synthase. Plastid transformation is routine, however, only in tobacco and the efficiency of transformation is much higher in tobacco than in other plants [58] . Lee et al. [50] discussed the major obstacles to the extension of plastid transformation technology to other crop plants which includes regeneration via somatic embryogenesis. Production of transgenic plants, at laboratory level or commercially, has traditionally been mainly through expression of transgenes in the nucleus [24, 25] . Among the ecological concerns raised about genetically engineered organisms is that transgenes could move (\"transgene flow\", the process of transgene movement by recurrent hybridisation) via pollen from the crop and into relatives growing in natural or semi-natural communities [59] . Such concerns have led to a new field of transgene containment [60, 61] . Since plastids are inherited maternally in the majority of angiosperm species, they would therefore not be found in pollen grains of corps. Insertion of transgenes, therefore, into the plastid genome has the potential of preventing gene flow via pollen. Hence, genes expressed in the plastome will not be transferred through pollination to weedy or wild relatives of the transgenic crop. Bansal and Sharma, [62] believes that there is little risk of any transgene flow via pollen from transplastomic plants to the neighboring weedy or wild relatives since plastids are almost always maternally transferred to the next progeny. The authors suggested that plastid transformation could be a method of choice for generating improved transgenics in crops that grow along with their weedy or wild relatives in the same geographical region, such as rice, sorghum, cucurbits, solanaceous crops, Vigna and Cajanus species, and various Brassica crops. Therefore, the focus of many researchers has shifted to plastid engineering [26] , rather than nuclear transformation. Singh et al. 2010 [26] reported that engineering of the plastid genome is gaining momentum as an attractive alternative to nuclear transformation. Ruf et al. [60] believe that plastid transformation is considered as a superb tool for ensuring transgene containment and improving the biosafety of transgenic plants. However, they pointed out that plastid transformation would only be effective as a biocontainment measure when applied on a landscape scale if it were combined additional mechanisms such as mitigating genes genetic use restriction technology, and/or male sterility [63] . In a recent study, it has been demonstrated that the use of plastid transformation would provide an imperfect biocontainment for GM oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) in the United Kingdom [64] . In another study, Allainguillaume et al. [65] revealed that chloroplast transformation may slow transgene recruitment in two settings, but actually accelerate transgene spread in a third. Plastid transformation has become an attractive alternative to nuclear gene transformation due to several other advantages [3] . The high ploidy number of the plastid genome allows high levels (up to 1-40% of total protein) of protein expression or expression of the transgene [28] . Daniell et al. [66] and Hou et al. [44] reported that while nuclear transgenes typically result in 0.5 -3% of total proteins, concentration of proteins expressed by plastid transgenes is much higher; up to 18%. The greater production of the expressed protein is possible because plastid transgenes are present as multiple copies per plant cell, and they are little affected by phenomena like pre-or post-transcriptional silencing. Other advantages of plastid engineering are the capacity to express multiple genes from polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) [31] , and the absence of epigenetic effects and gene silencing [40] . Wang et al. [3] believe that transgene stacking in operons and a lack of epigenetic interference allowing stable transgene expression. Added to that, plastid transformation is more environmental friendly than transformation of the nuclear DNA for plant engineering because it eliminates the possibility of toxic transgenic pollen to nontarget insects [67] . Adverse effects of toxic proteins might be minimized by plastid compartmentalization but in case of nuclear transformation, toxic proteins accumulating within the cytosol might result in serious pleiotropic effects. Further, the expression of the transgene in case of plastid transformation is more uniform compared to that of trangenes inserted into the nuclear genome. Although there is a major drawback in the engineering of plastid gene expression, which is the lack of tissue-specific developmentally regulated control mechanisms [3] , the many advantages of plastid engineering stated above attracted researchers to engineer the plastid genome to confer several useful agronomic traits, and hence the number of species whose plastome can be transformed continues to expand [68] . Gene delivery into the plastome was initially done by Agrobacterium mediated method [Block et al.1985 ] [69] . The discovery of biolistic DNA delivery led to plastid trans-formation via particle gun [Sanford 1990 ] [70] . In this method, the Escherichia coli plasmids contain a marker gene and the gene of interest is introduced into plastids. The foreign genes are inserted into plasmid DNA by homologous recombination via the flanking sequences at the insertion site [66] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated transformation of plastids was also utilized [71, 72] . PEG-mediated transformation of plastids requires enzymatically removing the cell wall to obtain protoplasts, then exposing the protoplasts to purified DNA in the presence of PEG. The protoplasts first shrink in the presence of PEG, then lyse due to disintegration of the cell membrane. Removing PEG before the membrane is irreversibly damaged reverses the process. Biolistic delivery is the routine system for most laboratories, as manipulation of leaves, cotyledons, or cultured cells in tissue culture is a simple practice than the alternative PEG treatment of protoplasts [58] . Recently, particle gun mediated plastid transformation has been demonstrated in rapeseed using cotyledons as explants [38] . The major difficulty in engineering plastid genome for production of transplastomic plants is in generating homoplasmic plants in which all the plastids are uniformly transformed, for that takes a long process of selection, thus hampering the production of genetically stable transplastomic plants (e.g. rice). This is due to the presence of about 10-100 plastids, each of which has up to 100 copies of the plastid genome, in one cell, that does not allow achieving homoplastomic state [73] . It was also stated that getting high level of protein expression, even though the gene copy number is high, is another problem. In 2005, however, Nguyen et al. [41] described the generation of homoplasmic plastid transformants of a commercial cultivar of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) using two tobacco specific plastid transformation vectors, pZS197 (Prrn/aadA/psbA3 ) and pMSK18 (trc/gfp/Prrn/aadA/psbA3 ). Similarly, Liu et al. [74] were able to develop homoplasmic fertile plants of Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata L. (cabbage). Among other higher plants of which fertile homoplasmic plants with genetically modified plastid genomes have be been produced are Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (texmex tobacco), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), Glycine max (soybean), Lesquerella fendleri (bladderpod), Gossypium hirsutum (cotton), Petunia hybrida (petunia), and Lactuca sativa (lettuce) [68] . The amino glycoside 3adenylyltransferase (aadA) gene, which confers dual resistance to spectinomycin-streptomycin antibiotics, is still the selectable marker that is routinely used efficiently for plastid transformation [58, 75, 76] . Since the antibiotic resistant genes used in transformation are not desirable in the final products, different strategies have been developed to eliminate the necessity of using such selectable markers [56, 77] . Apel & Bock, [42] demonstrated the potential of plastids genome engineering for the nutritional enhancement of food crops when they enhanced carotenoid biosynthesis in transplastomic tomatoes by induced lycopene-to-provitamin A conversion. The transplastomic technology could also be useful for engineering agronomic traits including phytoremediation [78] reversible male sterility [79] , and toler-ance/resistance of stresses such as diseases, drought, insect pests, salinity and freezing that can severely limit plant growth and development [3] . Since plastids are transferred mostly through the \"maternal inheritance\" as identical copies, and hence a female plant transfers identical copies to all the seeds it produces without changes from one generation to the next, an important promise for applying plastid transformation for industry is the stable passing on to the next generation of the foreign DNA [80] . Therefore, the plastid genome has also been utilized for metabolic pathway engineering and in the field of molecular farming (the production of drugs and chemicals through engineered crops) [27, 68] for the expression and production of biomaterials and biopharmaceuticals in plants, human therapeutic proteins, and vaccines for use in humans or animals (reviewed in [26, 27, 50] . Singh et al. [26] believe that for such applications, plastid transformation technology offers solutions to the ecological and technical problems associated with conventional transgenic technologies such as outcrossing and transgene silencing. Transformation of the nuclear genome of plants with genes (e.g. Bt genes) to confer insect resistance gives very low levels of expression unless extensive modifications are carried. Whereas, introduction of the same genes into the plastid genome results in high levels of toxin accumulation as the plastid genome is bacterial in origin [81] . Therefore, the insect resistance genes were investigated for high-level expression from the plastid genome [3] . Hence, when insect resistance genes are expressed into the plastid genome, leaves of these transplastomic plants proved highly toxic to herbivorous insect larvae. One of the major advantages of introducing the Bt toxin into the plastid genome is the high levels of toxin accumulation (3% -5% of total leaf protein as compared to > 0.2% of total soluble protein through nuclear genome transformation) [82] . Achievement of stable transformation of the plastid genome and transforming plastids in species other than tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) are some of the hurdles for widespread adaptation of this technique [81] . Despite of overwhelming odds, many attempts have been made to produce transplastomic plants expressing Bt toxin for increased resistance against insect pests. [83] generated soybean plastid transformants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab protoxin. Similarly, Chakrabarti et al. [84] reported the control of potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) by incorporating a truncated Bacillus thuringiensis cry9Aa2 gene in the plastid genome. The authors observed high-level expression (about 10% of total soluble protein) of the cry gene from the plastid genome which resulted in severe growth retardation. Over-expression of the cry2Aa2 operon in plastids was proved effective in allowing a broad-spectrum of protection against a range of pests [81] . In cabbage, the cry1Ab gene was also successfully transferred into the plastid genome [85] . Expression of cry1Ab protein was detected in the range of 4.8-11.1% of total soluble protein in transgenic mature leaves of the two species. Insecticidal effects on Plutella xylostella were also demonstrated in cry1Ab transformed cabbage. In an attempt to increase insect resistance in trans-genic rice plants, a synthetic truncated cry1Ac gene was linked to the rice rbcS promoter and its transit peptide sequence (tp) for plastid-targeted expression [86] . Use of the rbcS-tp sequence increased the cry1Ac transcript and protein levels by 25-and 100-fold, respectively, with the accumulated protein in plastids comprising up to 2% of the total soluble proteins. The high level of cry1Ac expression resulted in high levels of plant resistance to three common rice pests, rice leaf folder, rice green caterpillar, and rice skipper, as evidenced by insect feeding assays. It was concluded that targeting of cry1Ac protein to the plastid using the rbcS:tp system confers a high level of plant protection to insects. Several other cry proteins have also been expressed in plastids of tobacco [83, 84, 87, 88] and rice [50] (see Table 2 ). Plastid engineering offers a new and effective option in development of plant varieties which are resistant to various bacterial and fungal diseases. In tobacco, introduction of MSI-99 gene, an antimicrobial peptide, into plastids resulted in transplastomic plants resistant to fungal pathogen Colletotrichum destructive [89] . The plastids expressed MSI-99 at high levels and showed 88% (T1) and 96% (T2) inhibition of growth against Pseudomonas syringe, which is a major plant pathogen. In another study, Agrobacterium mediated transformation was used to develop tobacco plants carrying argK gene, which encodes ROCT [90] . Since OCT in plant cells is produced in the plastid, argK was fused to the plastid transit sequence of the pea rubisco small subunit (rbcS) gene for localized expression of the enzyme. The ROCT enzyme produced by the transgenic tobacco showed greater resistance (83-100%) to phaseolotoxin compared to the wild-type OCT (0-22%). When phaseolotoxin was applied exogenously to the leaves of plants, chlorosis was observed in 100% of wildtype tobacco, but not seen in the leaves of the transgenic tobacco plants carrying the argK gene from P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively expressed both entC and pmsB in the plastid have also been reported [91] where transformation was accomplished through biolistic methods. The transgenic tobacco plants expressing these bacterial genes showed accumulation of salicylic acid that were up to 1000 times higher than that observed in wild-type tobacco. When challenged with the fungus Oidium lycopersicon, the transgenic tobacco plants showed increased levels of resistance compared to the wildtype plants. It was revealed that the transgenic plants generated did not show any adverse effects due to the high level expression of salicylic acid. Thus gene transfer in plastids can provide a significant protection from various bacterial and fungal diseases. Transgenes that confer tolerance to abiotic stress may permanently transfer from transgenic crops to the nuclear genome of their weedy relatives which may result in drought tolerant superweeds [92] when the gene is inserted into the nuclear genome and the transgenic plant outcross with relative weeds. There is a great potential, therefore, for the genetic manipulation of key enzymes involved in stress metabolism in plants within plastids. Because plastid genomes of major crops including cotton and soybean have been Nicotiana tabacum nptII [153] Nicotiana tabacum uidA [154] Nicotiana tabacum Human somatotropin (hST) [155] Nicotiana tabacum cry [88] Nicotiana tabacum cry9Aa2 [84] Nicotiana tabacum Bar & aadA [156] Nicotiana tabacum Cor 15a-FAD7 [157] Nicotiana tabacum rbcL [55] Nicotiana tabacum DXR [158] Nicotiana tabacum aadA & gfp [60] Nicotiana tabacum Delta(9) desaturase [159] Nicotiana tabacum AsA2 [160] Nicotiana tabacum PhaG & PhaC [161] Nicotiana tabacum gfp [4] Nicotiana tabacum A1AT [162] Arabidopsis thaliana aadA [39] Solanum tuberosum aadA & gfp [40] Oryza sativa aadA & gfp [50] Solanum lycopersicon aadA [1] Solanum lycopersicon Lyc [42] Brassica napus aadA & cry1Aa10 [44] Brassica napus aadA [38] Lesquerella fendleri aadA & gfp [43] Daucus carota dehydrogenase (badh) [48] Gossypium hirsutum aphA-6 [49] Glycine max aadA [47] Petunia hybrida aadA & gusA [45] Lactuca sativa gfp [46] Brassica oleracea gus & aadA [163] Lettuce gfp [164] Populus alba gfp [51] Brassica oleracea aadA & uidA [74] Beta vulgaris aadA & uidA [165] Crocus sativus CstLcyB1& CstLcyB2a [166] Solanum melongena aadA [26] Arabidopsis thaliana pre-Tic40-His [167] Zea mays ManA [168] successfully transformed, this offers an exciting new approach to create transgenic plants with abiotic stress tolerance [93] . Therefore, the authors believe that there appears to be tremendous potential for increasing tolerance in plants to a number of stresses by expression of appropriate genes within plastids due to the maternal inheritance of transgenes that confer tolerance to abiotic stress. Plastid engineering had been successfully applied for the development of plants with tolerance to salt, drought [94] and low temperature [reviewed in 3]. Djilianov et al. [95] demonstrated that enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses has been achieved when the gene was directed to plastid genome. Among many strategies used for development of abiotic stress tolerance in plants, the over-expression of compatible osmolytes like glycinebetaine was found to be successful [24] . Initial attempts for producing transplastomic plants through the introduction of CMO (Choline monooxygenase) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) pathway were made in tobacco. Tobacco plants were transformed with cDNA for BADH from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) under the control of CaMV 35 S promoter. The BADH was produced in plastids of tobacco. Betaine aldehyde was converted to betaine by BADH, thus conferring resistance to betaine aldehyde. In another attempt, cDNA for choline monooxygenase from Spinacia oleracea was introduced into tobacco and the enzyme thus synthesized was transported to its functional place i.e., plastids. But the leaves of tobacco accumulated betaine at a very low concentration i.e., 10-100 folds lower [96] . The reason for insufficient synthesis of betaine most probably was the absence of engineered BADH activity in plastids. Therefore, both CMO and BADH need to be present in the plastids for efficient synthesis of betaine in transgenic plants which do not accumulate glycinebetaine. In carrot (Daucus carota), homoplasmic transgenic plants exhibiting high levels of salt tolerance were regenerated from bombarded cell cultures via somatic embryogenesis [48] . BADH enzyme activity was enhanced 8-fold in transgenic carrot cell cultures, grew 7-fold more, and accumulated 50-to 54-fold more betaine than untransformed cells grown in liquid medium containing 100 mM NaCl. Transgenic carrot plants expressing BADH grew in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl (up to 400 mM), the highest level of salt tolerance reported so far among genetically modified crop plants. Further, a gene for CMO, cloned from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) was introduced into rice through Agrobacterium mediated transformation. The level of glycinebetaine in rice was low to the expectations. The author has given several reasons for the low productivity of rice and low glycinebetaine accumulation. Firstly, the position of spinach CMO and endogenous BADH might be different and secondly the catalytic activity of spinach CMO in rice plants might be lower than it was in spinach [97] . Transplastomic plants constitutively expressing BvCMO under the control of the ribosomal RNA operon promoter and a synthetic T7 gene G10 leader were able to accumulate glycinebetaine in leaves, roots and seeds, and exhibited improved tolerance to toxic level of choline and to salt/drought stress when compared to wild type plants. Transplastomic plants showed higher net photosynthetic rate and apparent quantum yield of photosynthesis in the presence of 150 mM NaCl [98] . Thus, it can be concluded that glycinebetaine has a role as compatible solute and its engineering into non-accumulations will be a success only if both CMO and BADH pathways are introduced and if the localization of both CMO and BADH is in plastids. Very recently, George et al. [99] demonstrated how a chloroplastlocalized and auxin-induced glutathione S-transferase from phreatophyte Prosopis juliflora conferred drought tolerance on tobacco. For more examples of conferring tolerance to abiotic stress to plants via plastid engineering, see review by [3] . Mulesky et al. [100] pointed out two reasons that make using crops to produce drugs interesting for industry. These are (i) crops can be employed more efficiently in this process than animals or bacteria, with a larger output achieved with fewer resources, and (ii) the oral delivery of the drugs produced to people and animals is easier. A third reason is the high-level production of antigens for use as vaccines and their tests for immunological efficacy in animal studies [3] . The hyper-expression of vaccine antigens or therapeutic proteins in transgenic chloroplasts (leaves) or chromoplasts (fruits/roots) and antibiotic-free selection systems available in plastid transformation systems made possible the oral delivery of vaccine antigens against cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague, and canine parvovirus, [101] [102] [103] [104] and reviews of [102, 105, 3 and 106] explained why plastid engineering can be regarded as an attractive strategy and environmentally friendly approach for the production of vaccines, therapeutic proteins, and biomaterials, and provided some examples. Kumar & Daniell [107] described various techniques for creating plastid transgenic plants and their biochemical and molecular characterization. They also provided suitable examples for application of chloroplast genetic engineering in human medicine. Wang et al. [3] also discussed applying plastid transformation for metabolic pathway engineering in plants, the production of biopharmaceuticals, and marker gene excision system and how plastid transformation can be applied to study RNA editing. Similarly, Hefferon [67] , considers plastid engineering as a valuable tool that gives enormous promise for the production of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines, because higher level of the protein expressed by the transgene inserted into the plastid genome can be achieved. Many vaccine antigens, which played a key role for the prevention of infectious diseases, and biopharmaceutical proteins, have been expressed at high levels via the chloroplast genome [108] and they proved to be functional using in vitro assays in cell cultures. [109] stated that production of therapeutic proteins in plastids eliminates the expensive fermentation technology, and that the oral delivery of plastid-derived therapeutic proteins eliminates cold storage, cold transportation, expensive purification steps, and delivery via sterile needles, and hence decrease their cost. The main goal for applications of plastid transformation by the biotech industry is molecular pharming, and food production is considered as only a secondary target [80] . To create an edible vaccine, selected desired genes should be introduced into plants and then inducing these altered plants to manufacture the encoded proteins. Like conventional subunit vaccines, edible vaccines are composed of antigenic proteins and are devoid of pathogenic genes. Plastids of green plants as bioreactors for the production of vaccines and biopharmaceuticals are of great potential as indicated from a number of published studies [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] . The significance of using plants as production platforms for pharmaceuticals is due to the low production and delivery costs, easy scale-up and high safety standards regarding less risk of product contamination with human pathogen [27] . Keeping in view the high efficiency of plastids to express foreign genes, it is meaningful to explore this property of plastids for the production of proteinaceous pharmaceuticals, such as antigens, antibodies and antimicrobials. The candidate subunit vaccine against Clostridium tetani, causing tetanus was the first plastid-produced antigen that proved to be immunologically active in experimental animals [111] . In this initial attempt, fragment C of the tetanus toxin (TetC), a non-toxic protein fragment, was expressed from the tobacco plastid genome which resulted in high levels of antigen protein expression (30% of the plant's total soluble protein (TSP)). Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Significant development has been achieved towards the production of plastid-based vaccine for this infectious disease. Expression (14% of the plants TSP) of the pagA gene encoding the protective antigen (PA) from the tobacco plastid genome gave rise to stable antigen protein [112, 113] . The plastid-derived PA was equally effective in cytotoxicity assays as the bacterial protein produced in B. anthracis. The potential of plastid transformation as an alternative tool to produce high levels of HIV-1 Nef and p24 antigens in plant cells have been also demonstrated [115] . Different constructs were designed to express the p27 Nef protein either alone or as p24-Nef or Nef-p24 fusion proteins. All constructs were utilized to transform tobacco (cv. Petite Havana) plastids and the transplastomic lines. Analysis of p24-Nef and Nefp24 fusion proteins showed that both can be expressed to relatively high levels in plastids. As the best results in terms of protein expression levels were obtained with the p24-Nef fusion protein, the correspondent gene was cloned in a new expression vector. This construct was introduced into the tobacco and tomato plastid genomes. Transplastomic tobacco and tomato plants were analyzed and protein accumulation was found to be close to 40% of the leaf's total protein. Transcript and protein accumulation were analyzed in different ripening stage of tomato fruit and green tomatoes accumulated the fusion protein to 2.5% of the TSP [115] . Recently, a strategy for plastid production of antibiotics against pneumonia Streptococcus pneumonia has been outlined [116] . The authors describe it as a new technique for high level expression (to up to 30% of the plant's TSP) of antmicrobial proteins that are toxic to E. coli. It was also shown that the plastid-produced antibiotics efficiently kill pathogenic strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the causative agent of pneumonia, thus providing a promising strategy for the production of next-generation antibiotics in plants. In 2007, Chebolu and Daniell [117] achieved a stable expression of Gal/GalNAc lectin of Entamoeba histolytica in transgenic chloroplasts and immunogenicity in mice towards vaccine development for amoebiasis. Shao et al. [118] reported the expression of the structural protein E2 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which has been shown to carry critical epitopes CFSV E2 gene in tobacco chloroplasts. In another study on tobacco, plastid transformation of the high-biomass tobacco variety `Maryland Mammoth` has been assessed by McCabe et al. [119] as a production platform for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen. Similarly, Meyers et al. 2008 [120] revealed the usefulness of plastid signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. Transgenic plastids were also proved efficient for high-yield production of the vaccinia virus envelope protein A27L in plant cellsdagger by Rigano et al. [121] , who revealed that chloroplasts are an attractive production vehicle for the expression of OPV subunit vaccines. Very recently, Youm et al. [122] were able to produce the human beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) via transformation of tobacco plastids. The authors argued that the successful production of plastid-based BACE protein has the potential for developing a plant-based vaccine against Alzheimer disease. Because recombinant extra domain A from fibronectin (EDA) could be used as an adjuvant for vaccine development, [104] aimed to express EDA from the tobacco plastome as a promising strategy in molecular farming. Tobacco plastids transformation was also evaluated by Lentz et al. [123] for the production of a highly immunogenic epitope containing amino acid residues 135-160 of the structural protein VP1 of the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The authors concluded that this technology allows the production of large quantities of immunogenic proteins. In spite of this huge success in applying plastid engineering for molecular pharming, Ho & Cummins [73] referred to several risks of plastid engineering in producing GM pharmaceuticals that are associated with its advantages. For more details on the use of plastid engineering for biotechnology applications, see review by Verma & Daniell [5] . Other valuable reviews are available on (a) generation of plants with transgenic plastids, summary of our current understanding of the transformation process and highlights on selected applications of transplastomic technologies in basic and applied research [124] , (b) Progress in expressing proteins that are biomedically relevant, in engineering metabolic pathways, and in manipulating photosynthesis and agronomic traits and the problems of implementing the technology in crops [125] , (c) plastid transformation in higher plants [56] , (d) the characteristics, applications of chloroplast genetic engineering and its promising prospects, [126] , (e) Engineering the chloroplast genome [127] (f) exciting developments in this field and offers directions for further research and development, [128] (g) the expression of resistance traits, the production of biopharmaceuticals and metabolic pathway engineering in plants [27] , (h) chloroplasts as bioreactors, and whether we can replace plants with plants [129] , (i) how plastid transformation played an important role in understanding the RNA editing [3] and (j) comparison of opportunities and challenges between nuclear and plastid genetic engineering of plants [130] . Up to date, many transgenes have been successfully introduced into the plastid genome of model plant tobacco and many other important crop plants for various agronomic traits. Initially, this technology was limited to model plant species, but now it has been extended to some other important crops. Still there are many agronomically important cereals crops in which plastid engineering has not yet been standardized. Plastid transformation has been proved to result in high levels of transgene expression. It has also provided a baseline for production of proteinaceous pharmaceuticals, such as antigens, antibodies and antimicrobials in a cost effective manner. Bock [27] believes that a great progress has been achieved over years in investigating the mechanisms that govern transgene expression from the plastid genome and in using this technology for biotechnological applications. We agree with the author that \"the routine use of plastid engineering in biotechnology is still a long way off, but would surely benefit the humanity in the near future\". There is no doubt that plastid engineering holds a great potential in plant biotechnology; but like every new technology, there are some challenges which need to be addressed before its widespread adoption. Among other important factors to be solved are the protein purification and expression level control."

      "{'cord_uid': '8qnrcgnk', 'title': 'Heme oxygenase-1 and carbon monoxide in pulmonary medicine', 'abstract': 'Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible stress protein, confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function. Chronic, low-level, exogenous exposure to CO from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of CO in pulmonary medicine. The implications of the HO-1/CO system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review, with an emphasis on inflammatory states.', 'publish_time': '2003-08-07', 'source_x': 'PMC', 'authors': 'Slebos, Dirk-Jan; Ryter, Stefan W; Choi, Augustine MK', 'pdf_json_files': 'document_parses/pdf_json/faaf1022ccfe93b032c5608097a53543ba24aedb.json', 'pmc_json_files': 'document_parses/pmc_json/PMC193681.xml.json', 'full_text': 'The heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (HO-1/CO) system has recently seen an explosion of research interest due to its newly discovered physiological effects. This metabolic pathway, first characterized by Tenhunen et al. [1, 2] , has only recently revealed its surprising cytoprotective properties [3, 4] . Research in HO-1/CO now embraces the entire field of medicine where reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, inflammation, growth control, and apoptosis represent important pathophysiological mechanisms [3] [4] [5] [6] . Indeed, the number of publications in recent years concerning HO-1 has increased exponentially, while the list of diseases and physiological responses associated with changes in HO-1 continues to expand [5] . Until now, relatively few studies have addressed the role of HO-1/CO in pulmonary medicine. Several investigators have focused on the diagnostic application of the HO-1/CO system, by measuring exhaled CO (E-CO) in various pathological pulmonary conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7] . In another experimental approach, investigators have examined the expression of HO-1 in lung tissue from healthy or diseased subjects [8, 9] . This review will highlight the actions of HO-1/CO in the context of heme degradation have antioxidant properties [18, 19] . The liberated heme iron undergoes detoxification either by extracellular efflux or by sequestration into ferritin, an intracellular iron-storage molecule with potential cytoprotective function [20] [21] [22] [23] . Of the three known isoforms of HO (HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3), only HO-1 responds to xenobiotic induction [24] [25] [26] [27] . Constitutively expressed in many tissues, HO-2 occurs at high levels in nervous and vascular tissues, and may respond to regulation by glucocorticoids [25, 28, 29] . HO-1 and HO-2 differ in genetic origin, in primary structure, in molecular weight, and in their substrate and kinetic parameters [25, 26] . HO-3 displays a high sequence homology with HO-2 but has little enzymatic activity [27] . This review will focus on the inducible, HO-1, form. In addition to the physiological substrate heme, HO-1 responds to induction by a wide variety of stimuli associated with oxidative stress. Such inducing agents include hypoxia, hyperoxia, cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), heavy metals, ultraviolet-A (320-380 nm) radiation, heat shock, shear stress, hydrogen peroxide, and thiol (-SH)-reactive substances [3] . The multiplicity of toxic inducers suggest that HO-1 may function as a critical cytoprotective molecule [3, 4] . Many studies have suggested that HO-1 acts as an inducible defense against oxidative stress, in models of inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, hypoxia, and hyperoxia-mediated injury (reviewed in [3] ). The mechanisms by which HO-1 can mediate cytoprotection are still poorly understood. All three products of the HO reaction potentially participate in cellular defense, of which the gaseous molecule CO has recently received the most attention [30, 31] . The administration of CO at low concentrations can compensate for the protective effects of HO-1 in the presence of competitive inhibitors of HO-1 activity [32] [33] [34] . While HO-1 gene transfer confers protection against oxidative stress in a number of systems, clearly not all studies support a beneficial role for HO-1 expression. Cell-culture studies have suggested that the protective effects of HO-1 overexpression fall within a critical range, such that the excess production of HO-1 or HO-2 may be counterprotective due to a transient excess of reactive iron generated during active heme metabolism [35, 36] . Thus, an important caveat of comparative studies on the therapeutic effects of CO administration versus HO-1 gene delivery arises from the fact that the latter approach, in addition to producing CO, may have profound effects on intracellular iron metabolism. HO-1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. Genetic analyses have revealed two enhancer sequences (E1, E2) in the murine HO-1 gene located at -4 kb (E1) and -10 kbp (E2) of the transcriptional start site [37, 38] . These enhancers mediate the induction of HO-1 by many agents, including heavy metals, phorbol esters, endotoxin, oxidants, and heme. E1 and E2 contain repeated stress-responsive elements, which consist of overlapping binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein-1 (AP-1), v-Maf oncoprotein, and the cap\\'n\\'collar/basic-leucine zipper family of proteins (CNC-bZIP), of which Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor) may play a critical role in HO-1 transcription [39] . The promoter region of HO-1 also contains potential binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), though the functional significance of these are not clear [40] . Both NF-κB and AP-1 have been identified as regulatory elements responsive to oxidative cellular stress [40, 41] . In response to hyperoxic stress, AP-1 factors mediated the induction of HO-1 in cooperation with signal-transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins [41] . Furthermore, a distinct hypoxia-response element (HRE), which mediates the HO-1 response to hypoxia, represents a binding site for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [42] . The toxic properties of CO are well known in the field of pulmonary medicine. This invisible, odorless gas still claims many victims each year by accidental exposure. CO evolves from the combustion of organic materials and is present in smoke and automobile exhaust. The toxic actions of CO relate to its high affinity for hemoglobin (240-fold greater than that of O 2 ). CO replaces O 2 rapidly from hemoglobin, causing tissue hypoxia [43] [44] [45] . At high concentrations, other mechanisms of CO-induced toxicity may include apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of drug metabolism and respiratory enzyme functions [44] . Only recently has it become known that, at very low concentrations, CO participates in many physiological reactions. Where a CO exposure of 10,000 parts per million (ppm) (1% by volume CO in air) is toxic, 100-250 ppm (one hundredth to one fortieth as much) will stimulate the physiological effects without apparent toxicity [4] . The majority of endogenous CO production originates from active heme metabolism (>86%), though a portion may be produced in lipid peroxidation and drug metabolism reactions [46] . Cigarette smoking, still practiced by many lung patients, represents a major source of chronic lowlevel exposure to CO. Inhaled CO initially targets alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells. The exact mechanisms by which CO acts at the molecular level remain incompletely understood. CO potentially exerts its physiological effects by influencing at least three known pathways (Fig. 2 ). By complexation with the heme moiety of the enzyme, CO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), stimulating the production of cyclic 3\\':5\\'guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) [47] . The sGC/cGMP pathway mediates the effects of CO on vascular relaxation, smooth muscle cell relaxation, bronchodilation, neurotransmission, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation, coagulation, and smooth muscle proliferation [48] [49] [50] [51] . Furthermore, CO may cause vascular relaxation by directly activating calcium-dependent potassium channels [52] [53] [54] . CO potentially influences other intracellular signal transduction pathways. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which transduce oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling (i.e. response to lipopolysaccharide), may represent an important target Possible mechanism(s) of carbon monoxide action Figure 2 Possible mechanism(s) of carbon monoxide action. Endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) arises principally as a product of heme metabolism, from the action of heme oxygenase enzymes, although a portion may arise from environmental sources such as pharmacological administration or accidental exposure, or other endogenous processes such as drug and lipid metabolism. The vasoregulatory properties of CO, including its effects on cellular proliferation, platelet aggregation, and vasodilation, have been largely ascribed to the stimulation of guanylate cyclase by direct heme binding, leading to the generation of cyclic GMP. The anti-inflammatory properties of CO are associated with the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, dependent on the selective modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as the 38 kilodalton protein (p38MAPK). In addition to these two mechanisms, CO may potentially interact with any hemoprotein target, though the functional consequences of these interactions with respect to cellular signaling remain poorly understood. Anti-Platelet Aggregation Anti-Proliferation  ? Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production Modulation of hemoprotein function of CO action [32, 34, 55, 56 ]. An anti-apoptotic effect of CO and its relation to MAPK has recently been described. The overexpression of HO-1 or the exogenous administration of CO prevented tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)induced apoptosis in murine fibroblasts [57] . In endothelial cells, the anti-apoptotic effect of CO depended on the modulation of the p38 (38 kilodalton protein) MAPK pathway [34] . The role of the remaining heme metabolites, (i.e. Fe and biliverdin IXα) in the modulation of apoptosis is currently being investigated and is beyond the scope of this review. Recent studies have reported a potent anti-inflammatory effect of CO, involving the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production after endotoxin stimulation, dependent on the modulation of p38 MAPK [32] . The clinical relevance of p38 MAPK lies in the possibility of modulating this pathway in various clinical conditions to downregulate the inflammatory response [58] . Oxidative stress arising from an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants plays a central role in the pathogenesis of airway disease [59] . In lung tissue, HO-1 expression may occur in respiratory epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and to a large extent in alveolar macrophages [41, 60, 61] . HO-1 induction in these tissues, in vitro and in vivo, responds to common causes of oxidative stress to the airways, including hyperoxia, hypoxia, endotoxemia, heavy metal exposure, bleomycin, diesel exhaust particles, and allergen exposure [4, 41, 61] . Induction of HO-1 or administration of CO can protect cells from these stressful stimuli [10, 41] . In one of the experiments that best illustrate the protective role of CO in vivo, rats were exposed to hyperoxia (>98% O 2 ) in the absence or presence of CO at low concentration (250 ppm). The CO-treated rats showed increased survival and a diminished inflammatory response to the hyperoxia [11] . As demonstrated in a model of endotoxin-induced inflammation, the protection afforded by CO most likely resulted from the downregulated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IL-1β) and the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) [32] . Furthermore, increases in exhaled CO (E-CO) have been reported in a number of pathological pulmonary conditions, such as unstable asthma, COPD, and infectious lung disease; these increases may reflect increased endogenous HO-1 activity [7] . Elevated carboxyhemoglobin (Hb-CO) levels have also been reported in these same diseases in nonsmoking subjects, where both the E-CO and Hb-CO levels decrease to normal levels in response to therapy [62] . E-CO in humans originates primarily from both systemic heme metabolism, which produces CO in various tissues, and localized (lung) heme metabolism, as a result of the combined action of inducible HO-1 and constitutive HO-2 enzymatic activity. Endogenously produced or inspired CO is eliminated exclusively by respiration [63] . Elevation of E-CO may also reflect an increase in exogenous sources such as smoking or air pollution. In addition to changes in environmental factors, elevations of E-CO in lung diseases may reflect an increase in blood Hb-CO levels in response to systemic inflammation, as well as an increase in pulmonary HO-1 expression in response to local inflammation [9, 62, 64] . The diagnostic value of measuring E-CO remains controversial due to many conflicting reports (i.e. some reports indicate differences in E-CO measurements between disease activity and controls, and some reports do not). The possible explanations for these discrepancies include large differences in patient populations and in the methods used for measuring E-CO, and undefined corrections for background levels of CO. Furthermore, remarkable differences arise between studies in the magnitude of the E-CO levels in the control groups as well as in treated or untreated asthma patients. When active or passive smoking occurs, or in the presence of high background levels of CO, the measurement of E-CO is not particularly useful for monitoring airway inflammation. In patients who smoke, E-CO can be used only to confirm the smoking habit [65, 66] . Comparable to the beginning era of measurements of exhaled NO, a standardization in techniques and agreement on background correction should be reached for E-CO measurements, to allow proper conclusions to be drawn in this area of investigation. Asthma, a form of allergic lung disease, features an accumulation of inflammatory cells and mucus in the airways, associated with bronchoconstriction and a generalized airflow limitation. Inflammation, a key component of asthma, involves multiple cells and mediators where an imbalance in oxidants/antioxidants contributes to cell damage. Several pathways associated with oxidative stress may participate in asthma. For example, the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 control the expression of proinflammatory mediators [59, [67] [68] [69] . In light of the potential protective effects of HO-1/CO on inflammatory processes, the study of HO-1 in asthma has gained popularity. In a mouse model of asthma, HO-1 expression increased in lung tissue in response to ovalbumin aerosol challenge, indicating a role for HO-1 in asthma [70] . In a similar model of aeroallergen-induced asthma in ovalbumin-sensitized mice, exposure to a CO atmosphere resulted in a marked attenuation of eosinophil content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-5 [10] . This experiment showed that exogenous CO can inhibit asthmatic responses to allergens in mice. Recent human studies have revealed higher HO-1 expression in the alveolar macrophages and higher E-CO in untreated asthmatic patients than in healthy nonsmoking controls [71, 72] . Patients with exacerbations of asthma and patients who were withdrawn from inhaled steroids showed higher E-CO levels than steroid-treated asthmatics or healthy controls [73] . Higher levels of E-CO may also occur in children with persistent asthma than in healthy controls [74] . E-CO levels may correlate with functional parameters such as peak expiratory flow rate. A low rate in asthma exacerbations correlated with high E-CO, whereas normalization of the rate with oral glucocorticoid treatment resulted in a reduction of E-CO [75] . Furthermore, increased E-CO was associated with greater expression of HO-1 in airway alveolar macrophages obtained by induced sputum in untreated asthmatic patients than in controls. These asthma patients also showed higher bilirubin levels in the induced sputum, indicating higher HO activity [71] . Furthermore, patients with asthma show an increased Hb-CO level at the time of exacerbation, with values decreasing to control levels after oral glucocorticoid treatment [62] . In human asthmatics, E-CO and airway eosinophil counts decreased in response to a one-month treatment with inhaled corticosteroids [73] . In direct contrast to such studies promoting E-CO as a useful noninvasive tool for monitoring airway inflammation, other studies reported no difference in E-CO levels of asthma patients versus healthy controls, or between patients with stable and unstable asthma. In one such report, no further change in E-CO occurred in asthma patients after a one-month treatment of inhaled corticosteroids, despite observed decreases in airway eosinophil content and bronchial responsiveness to metacholine [76] . A recent study accentuates this finding in asthma excerbations, where no decrease in E-CO of children with asthma could be detected after oral prednisolone treatment [77] . In human allergic responses, results on elevation of E-CO are also inconclusive. A clear elevation of E-CO after allergen exposure occurred in patients with asthma during the late response, and during the early response immediately after the inhalation [78] . However, another report showed that no elevation of E-CO occurred in allergen-induced asthma within 48 hours after allergen challenge [79] . Finally, increases in E-CO were measured in allergic rhinitis, correlating with seasonal changes in exposure to allergen (pollen) [80] . Airway inflammation plays an important role in the development of COPD, characterized by the presence of macrophages, neutrophils, and inflammatory mediators such as proteinases, oxidants, and cytokines. Further-more, the inflammatory consequences of chronic microbiological infections may contribute to the progression of the disease. The current paradigm for the pathogenesis of COPD involves imbalances in protease/antiprotease activities and antioxidant/pro-oxidant status. Proteases with tissue-degrading capacity, (i.e. elastases and matrix metalloproteinases), when insufficiently inhibited by antiproteases, can induce tissue damage leading to emphysema. Oxidants that supersede cellular antioxidant defenses can furthermore inactivate antiproteases, cause direct injury to lung tissue, and interfere with the repair of the extracellular matrix. Smoking plays an important role in both hypotheses. Cigarette smoke will act primarily on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, which react to this oxidative stress by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and releasing growth factors. Nevertheless, smoking cannot be the only factor in the development of COPD, since only 15-20% of smokers develop the disease [81, 82] . Exposure to reactive oxygen species (from cigarette smoke or chronic infections) and an imbalance in oxidant/antioxidant status are the main risk factors for the development of COPD. To defend against oxidative stress, cells and tissues contain endogenous antioxidant defense systems, which include millimolar concentrations of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH). A close relation exists between GSH concentration and HO-1, whereby depletion of GSH augments the transcriptional regulation of HO-1 by oxidants, suggesting that the HO-1/CO system acts as a secondary defense against oxidative stress [83] [84] [85] [86] . Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that HO-1/ CO may also play an important part in COPD. Alveolar macrophages, which produce a strong HO-1 response to stimuli, may represent the main source of CO production in the airways [60, 64] . Patients with COPD have displayed higher E-CO than healthy nonsmoking controls [87] . Furthermore, much higher levels of HO-1 have been observed in the airways of smokers than in nonsmokers [64] . Among subjects who formerly smoked, patients with COPD have lower HO-1 expression in alveolar macrophages than healthy subjects [88] . A microsatellite polymorphism that is linked with the development of COPD may occur in the promoter region of HO-1, resulting in a lower production of HO-1 in people who have the polymorphism. Thus, a genetically dependent downregulation of HO-1 expression may arise in subpopulations, possibly linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress [89] [90] [91] . Future studies on both genetic predisposition and possible therapeutic modalities will reveal the involvement of the HO-1/CO system in COPD. Cystic fibrosis (CF) involves a deposition of hyperviscous mucus in the airways associated with pulmonary dysfunc-tion and pancreatic insufficiency, which may be accompanied by chronic microbiological infections. E-CO readings were higher in untreated versus oral-steroidtreated CF patients [92] . Furthermore, E-CO increased in patients during exacerbations of CF, correlating to deterioration of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), with normalization of the E-CO levels after treatment [93] . E-CO levels may correlate with exhaled ethane, a product of lipid peroxidation that serves as an indirect marker of oxidative stress. Both E-CO and exhaled ethane were higher in steroid-treated and untreated CF patients than in healthy controls [94] . E-CO was higher in children with CF than in control patients. In addition to the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to continuous infectious pressure in these patients, E-CO may possibly respond to hypoxia. E-CO increased further in CF children following an exercise test, and correlated with the degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, a finding suggestive of an increased HO-1 expression in CF patients during hypoxic states induced by exercise [95] . In patients with pneumonia, higher Hb-CO levels can be measured at the onset of illness, with values decreasing to control levels after antibiotic treatment [62] . E-CO levels were reported to be higher in lower-respiratory-tract infections and bronchiectasis, with normalization after antibiotic treatment [96, 97] . Furthermore, E-CO levels in upper-respiratory-tract infections were higher than in healthy controls [74, 80] . The relationship between higher measured E-CO in these infectious states and higher Hb-CO levels cannot be concluded from these studies. The role of HO-1 in the development of interstitial lung disease remains undetermined. Comparative immunohistochemical analysis has revealed that lung tissue of control subjects, patients with sarcoidosis, usual interstitial pneumonia, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia, all showed a high expression of HO-1 in the alveolar macrophages but a weak expression in the fibrotic areas [98] . The antiproliferative properties of HO-1 suggest a possible beneficial role in limiting fibrosis; however, this hypothesis is complicated by a newly discovered relation between IL-10 and HO-1. IL-10 produced by bronchial epithelial cells promotes the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts [99] . HO-1 expression and CO treatment have been shown to increase the production of IL-10 in macrophages following proinflammatory stimuli [32] . Conversely, IL-10 induces HO-1 production, which is apparently required for the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 [100] . A recent report clearly shows the suppression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by adenovirus-mediated HO-1 gene transfer and overexpression in C57BL/6 mice, involving the inhibition of apoptotic cell death [101] . Overall, more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of HO-1 in interstitial lung disease and its possible therapeutic implications. HO-1 action may be of great importance in solid tumors, an environment that fosters hypoxia, oxidative stress, and neovascularization. HO-1 may have both pro-and antagonistic effects on tumor growth and survival. HO-1 and CO cause growth arrest in cell-culture systems and thus may represent a potential therapeutic modality in modulating tumor growth [16] . The overexpression of HO-1 or administration of CO in mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma mouse models resulted in improved survival (>90%) as well as reduction in tumor size (>50%) [17] . Furthermore, HO-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas can be useful in identifying patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. High expression of HO-1 was detected in groups without lymph node metastasis in this report [102] . In contrast to growth arrest, HO-1 may protect solid tumors from oxidative stress and hypoxia, possibly by promoting neovascularization. In one study, zinc protoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of HO-1 enzyme activity, suppressed tumor growth [103] . CO may represent a critical mediator of the body\\'s adaptive response to hypoxia, a common feature in pulmonary vascular disease [104] . Since CO can modulate vascular tone by inducing cGMP and large, calcium-dependent potassium channels, HO-1 and CO probably play important roles in pulmonary vascular diseases [54] . A NOmediated HO-1 induction occurred in the hepatopulmonary syndrome during cirrhosis, associated with enhancement of vascular relaxation [105] . In portopulmonary hypertension, elevated levels of cGMP and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in the vascular endothelium, and HO-1 expression in macrophages and bronchial epithelium have been described [106] . In transgenic mice models, ho-1 -/and ho-1 +/+ mice did not differ in their development of pulmonary hypertension following chronic hypoxia treatment, despite the development of right ventricular dilation and right myocardial infarction in ho-1 -/mice [107] . The preinduction of HO-1 protein with chemical inducers, however, prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension in the rat lung as a consequence of chronic hypoxia treatment [108] . Transgenic mice overexpressing HO-1 in the lung were resistant to hypoxia-induced inflammation and hypertension [109] . Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of HO-1 and CO in primary human lung vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension. Supplemental oxygen therapy is often used clinically in the treatment of respiratory failure. Exposure to high oxygen tension (hyperoxia) may cause acute and chronic lung injury, by inducing an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema [110, 111] . Hyperoxia-induced lung injury causes symptoms in rodents that resemble human acute respiratory distress syndrome [112] . Hyperoxia induced HO-1 expression in adult rats but apparently not in neonatal rats, in which the expression and activities of HO-1 and HO-2 are developmentally upregulated during the prenatal and early postnatal period [113] . Both HO-1 and HO-2 potentially influence pulmonary adaptation to high O 2 levels. In one example, the adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of HO-1 into rat lungs protected against the development of lung apoptosis and inflammation during hyperoxia [114] . In vitro studies showed that the overexpression of HO-1 in lung epithelial cells or rat fetal lung cells caused growth arrest and conferred resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell death [15, 16] . An oxygen-tolerant variant of hamster fibroblasts that moderately overexpressed HO-1 in comparison with the parent line resisted oxygen toxicity in vitro. The treatment of this oxygen-tolerant strain with HO-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the resistance to hyperoxia. In contrast, additional, vector-mediated, HO-1 expression did not further increase oxygen tolerance in this model [115] . In vivo studies with gene-deleted mouse strains have provided much information on the roles of HO-1 and HO-2 in oxygen tolerance. Dennery et al. demonstrated that heme oxygenase-2 knockout mice (ho-2 -/-) were more sensitive to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than wild-type mice [116] . In addition to the absence of HO-2 expression, however, the mice displayed a compensatory increase in HO-1 protein expression, and higher total lung HO activity. Thus, in this model, the combination of HO-2 deletion and HO-1 overexpression resulted in a hyperoxiasensitive phenotype. Recent studies of Dennery et al. have shown that HO-1-deleted (ho-1 -/-) mice were more resistant to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than the corresponding wild type [117] . The hyperoxia resistance observed in the ho-1 -/strain could be reversed by the reintroduction of HO-1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer [117] . In contrast, mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from ho-1 -/mice showed increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of hemin and H 2 O 2 and generated more intracellular reactive oxygen species in response to these agents [118] . Both ho-1 -/-and ho-2 -/strains were anemic, yet displayed abnormal accumulations of tissue iron. Specifically, ho-1 -/accumulated nonheme iron in the kidney and liver and had decreased total iron content in the lung, while ho-2 -/mice accumulated total lung iron in the absence of a compensatory increase in ferritin levels [116, 119] . The mechanism(s) by which HO-1 or HO-2 deletions result in accumulation of tissue iron remain unclear. These studies, taken together, have indicated that animals deficient in either HO-1 and HO-2 display altered sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. Aberrations in the distribution of intra-and extra-cellular iron, may underlie in part, the differential sensitivity observed [116, 117] . Otterbein et al. have shown that exogenous CO, through anti-inflammatory action, may protect the lung in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. The presence of CO (250 ppm) prolonged the survival of rats in a hyperoxic (>95% O 2 ) environment, and inhibited the appearance of markers of hyperoxia-induced lung injury (i.e. hemorrhage, fibrin deposition, edema, airway protein accumulation, and BALF neutrophil influx) [11] . Furthermore, in a mouse model, CO inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in mice induced by the hyperoxia treatment. Using genedeleted mice, Otterbein and colleagues also observed that the protection afforded by CO in this model, similar to a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of lung injury, depended on the p38 MAPK pathway (Otterbein et al., unpublished observation, as reviewed in [3] ). In direct contrast to these studies, the group of Piantadosi and colleagues reported no significant difference in the hyperoxia tolerance of rats at CO doses between 50 and 500 ppm [120] . In their model, CO did not alter the accumulation of fluid in the airway. Furthermore, CO, when applied in combination with hyperoxia, increased the activity of myeloperoxidase, a marker of airway neutrophil influx. This study also suggested that inhalation of CO (50-500 ppm) did not alter the expression of HO-1 or other antioxidant enzymes such as Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in vivo [120] . Furthermore, Piantadosi and colleagues were able to induce oxygen tolerance in rats and HO-1 expression with hemoglobin treatment, but this tolerance also occurred in the presence of HO inhibitors, thereby not supporting a role for HO activity in oxygen tolerance [121] . Although no consensus has been reached as to the protective role of CO inhalation and/or HO-1 induction in hyperoxic lung injury, human studies will be required to show if CO will supersede NO in providing a significant therapeutic benefit in the context of severe lung diseases [122] . While antioxidant therapies have been examined, until now no human studies exist on the role of HO-1 and CO in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [123] . Lung transplantation is the ultimate and often last therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. After lung transplantation, there remains an ongoing hazardous situation in which both acute and chronic graft failure, as well as complications of the toxic immunosuppressive regimen used (i.e. severe bacterial, fungal, and viral infections; renal failure; and Epstein-Barr-virus-related lymphomas), determine the outcome [124] . The development of chronic graft failure, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), determines the overall outcome after lung transplantation. OB, which may develop during the first months after transplantation, is the main cause of morbidity and death following the first half-year after transplantation, despite therapeutic intervention. Once OB has developed, retransplantation remains the only therapeutic option available [124, 125] . Little is known about the pathophysiological background of OB. The possible determinants of developing OB include ongoing immunological allograft response, HLADR mismatch, cytomegalovirus infection, acute rejection episodes, organ-ischemia time, and recipient age [125] . OB patients displayed elevated neutrophil counts in the BALF, and evidence of increased oxidant activity, such as increased methionine oxidation in BALF protein and decreases in the ratio of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in epithelial lining fluid. [126, 127] . So far, only very limited research data are available on the possible role for HO-1 in allograft rejection after lung transplantation. Higher HO-1 expression has been detected in alveolar macrophages from lung tissue in lung transplant recipients with either acute or chronic graft failure than in stable recipients [128] . The protective role of HO-1 against allograft rejection has been shown in other transplantation models, in which solid organ transplantation typically benefits from HO-1 modulation. A higher expression of protective genes such as HO-1 has been observed in episodes of acute renal allograft rejection [129] . Furthermore, the induction of HO-1 alleviates graft-versus-host disease [130] . Adenoviral-HO-1 gene therapy resulted in remarkable protection against rejection in rat liver transplants [131] . The upregulation of HO-1 protected pancreatic islet cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion, supporting an anti-apoptotic function of HO-1 [132, 133] . HO-1 may confer protection in the early phase after transplantation by inducing Th2-dependent cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, while suppressing interferon-γ and IL-2 production, as demonstrated in a rat liver allograft model [134] . Beneficial effects of HO-1 modulation have also been described in xenotransplantation models, in which HO-1 gene expression appears functionally associated with xenograft survival [135] . In a mouse-to-rat heart trans-plant model, the effects of HO-1 upregulation could be mimicked by CO administration, suggesting that HOderived CO suppressed the graft rejection [136] . The authors proposed that CO suppressed graft rejection by inhibition of platelet aggregation, a process that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction. HO-1 may also contribute to ischemic preconditioning, a process of acquired cellular protection against ischemia/ reperfusion injury, as observed in guinea pig transplanted lungs [137] . HO-1 overexpression provided potent protection against cold ischemia/reperfusion injury in a rat model through an anti-apoptotic pathway [138, 139] . The induction of HO-1 in rats undergoing liver transplantation with cobalt-protoporphyrin or adenoviral-HO-1 gene therapy resulted in protection against ischemia/ reperfusion injury and improved survival after transplantation, possibly by suppression of Th1-cytokine production and decreased apoptosis after reperfusion [140, 141] . Until now, no reports have addressed E-CO measurements in lung transplantation, where it is possible that differences in E-CO will be found in patients with acute and chronic allograft rejection. The evolution of CO in exhaled breath may serve as a general marker and diagnostic indicator of inflammatory disease states of the lung, though more research will be required to verify its reliability. Increases in exhaled CO presumably reflect changes in systemic and airway heme metabolic activity from the action of HO enzymes. Evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies indicates that HO-1 provides a protective function in many, if not all, diseases that involve inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the exploitation of HO-1 for therapeutic gain could be achieved through the modulation of HO-1 enzyme activity or its up-and downstream regulatory factors, either by gene transfer, pharmacological inducers, or direct application of CO by gas administration or chemical delivery [142] [143] [144] [145] . The CO-releasing molecules (transition metal carbonyls) developed by Motterlini et al. [144] show promise in the pharmacological delivery of CO for therapeutic applications in vascular and immune regulation. The CO-releasing molecules have been shown to limit hypertension in vivo and promote vasorelaxation in isolated heart and aortic rings [144] . Ultimately, the challenge remains in applying the therapeutic potentials of HO-1 to the treatment of human diseases. In vivo models of transplantation have shown that HO-1 gene therapy protects against allograft rejection [129, 134] . Given the toxic therapy that every transplant patient receives, especially after lung transplantation, the field of transplantation medicine may bring the first frontier for human applications of HO-1 gene therapy or exogenous CO administration. The potential use of inhalation CO as a clinical therapeutic in inflammatory lung diseases has also appeared on the horizon. In one promising study, an inhalation dose of 1500 ppm CO at the rate of 20 times per day for a week produced no cardiovascular side effects [146] . Cigarette smoking and CO inhalation at identical intervals produced comparable Hb-CO levels of approximately 5%. The question of whether or not CO can be used as an inhalation therapy will soon be replaced by questions of \"how much, how long, and how often?\" The fear of administering CO must be weighed against the severe toxicity of the immunosuppressive agents in current use, and the often negative outcome of solid organ transplantation.

         "Relevance of human metapneumovirus in exacerbations of COPD",
         "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma. Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum. It was not found in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. CONCLUSION: HMPV is only found in a very small number of patients with AE-COPD. However it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of AE-COPD because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely.",

         "Respiratory viruses play an important role in exacerbations of COPD and this has been increasingly recognised since the application of molecular detection methods [1, 2] . The most prevalent viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction so far were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza 3. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus first isolated from a dutch child with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [3] . World wide distribution is probable since it has been isolated in North HMPV has been recognized as a member of the Paramyxoviridae like RSV and it is not only associated with bronchiolitis in most cases, but also with pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma [14, 15] , diseases which share some features with COPD. Up to date reports about hMPV in adults are scarce. In a general Canadian population 14.8% of patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections were hMPV positive. Thirty-three percent of hMPV-infected patients were hospitalized and the hospitalization rates were significantly higher among patients below 5 years and those over 50 years of age [16] . In another prospective cohort of adults, hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses but also in 4.1% of asymptomatic subjects. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly [17] . HMPV infection can be severe since the virus was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . The role of hMPV in acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) has been studied recently in outpatients and only low frequencies have been observed [17, 19] . Up to now the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized with AE-COPD is unknown. Our aim was therefore to investigate the frequency of detection of hMPV in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to compare these results to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without COPD. Three different groups were studied. The first group consisted of hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD), the second group were subjects with stable COPD and the third group was composed of smokers without COPD. The groups were defined as previously published [20] . Briefly AE-COPD patients suffered from COPD as defined by GOLD [21] . Acute exacerbation was characterized by worsening in dyspnea, cough, and expectoration. A routine posterior-anterior chest radiograph was evaluated on admission by expert radiologists to exclude other other reasons for increased symptoms as pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchial carcinoma or congestive heart failure.Stable COPD patients did not have an exacerbation within the last 30 days prior to hospital admission and had no changes in therapy within the last 14 days (including inhaled and oral medication) and had been admitted for other medical reasons into departments of internal medicine other than pulmonary care. COPD subjects were recruited in a 2:1 ratio each month in order to prevent seasonal selection bias. Smokers have been smoking more than 10 pack-years, could have chronic symptoms like cough and phlegm but did not report dyspnea and did not have bronchial obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC>70%, FEV 1 >80% predicted). None of the smokers had a history of COPD or asthma, nor was using systemic or topic pulmonary medication. The smokers were recruited either from our smoking cessation initiative or by newspaper advertisement. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Ruhr-University of Bochum, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects before inclusion in the study. Clinical evaluation, spirometric tests, nasal lavage, induced sputum, specimen processing and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction were carried out as described by Rohde et al [2] . Elution volume was 100 µl. cDNA was generated with random-hexamer primers as previously published[2]. A hMPV-specific real-time RT-PCR designed and evaluated by Maertzdorf et al was used [22] . Primers and probe are localized within the nucleoprotein gene (NL-N) and the presence of a degenerate base within the probe allows detection of all four genetic lineages of hMPV. The assays were performed using the TaqMan ® PCR Core Kit. The final volume was 25 µl containing 500 nM of the forward primer (NL-N-forward (5'-CATATAAGCAT-GCTATATTAAAAGAGTCTC-3')), 250 nM of the reverse primer (NL-N-reverse (5'-CCTATTTCTGCAGCATATTTG-TAATCAG-3')) and 500 nM of the probe (NL-N-probe (5'-FAM-TGYAATGATGAGGGTGTCACTGCGGTTG-TAMRA-3', in which Y is either a C or a T residue). Nuclease-free water was used as negative control and a plasmid containing the N gene of hMPV (kindly provided by James Simon, VIRONOVATIVE, EUR Holding, Erasmus University Rotterdam) was used as a positive control in all PCR runs. Cycling parameters were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Amplification and detection of RNA from virus isolates or clinical specimens were performed using the GeneAmp ® 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The real-time PCR product was cloned with the QIAGEN ® PCR cloning kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and this standard plasmid DNA was used for absolute quantification of hMPV viral load. Calculations were performed as previously described for absolute quantification of RSV viral load [23] . The primary objective of this study was to compare the frequency of hMPV detection in respiratory specimens between COPD patients with or without an acute exacerbation and smokers without COPD. Continuous data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data were of non-parametrical distribution and results were expressed as median and range. Differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test. To further analyse significant differences between two individual groups a pair wise comparison by two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. All significance levels were set to 5%. Data were analysed and processed using SPSS Version 12.0 on a Windows XP operating system. A total of 229 subjects were investigated between October 1999 and June 2004: 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. The clinical characteristics and lung function measurements are summarized in table 1. FEV 1 , FEV 1 in % of predicted value and FEV 1 /FVC were normal in smokers, significantly decreased in stable COPD patients (all) and further significantly decreased in AE-COPD patients (all p < 0.05 compared to stable COPD and all p < 0.001 compared to smokers). HMPV could be detected in three subjects. All these subjects were AE-COPD patients. The prevalence of hMPV in AE-COPD patients was 2.3%. The virus was simultaneously detected in nasal lavage and induced sputum in one patient only. The viral load was about 100 times higher in nasal lavage than in induced sputum in this patient. Overall the viral load in nasal lavage was about 3.5 times higher compared to induced sputum (for details see table 2). The hMPV positive patients did not differ significantly from other AE-COPD patients when clinical parameters and lung function were analysed. hMPV was detected in the winter season only. The main finding of this controlled study investigating the incidence of hMPV in subjects with COPD and smokers without COPD is that this recently discovered respiratory virus was detectable only during exacerbation of COPD. The frequency of detection was very low but in positive cases the viral load was considerable. There was no detection in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. Recently Vicente et al [19] reported about the incidence of hMPV in 89 COPD patients. Five patients (5.5%) were hMPV positive. Two of these patients had to be transferred to hospital. Although this was not a controlled study and not all details of the study are available due to the fact that the data were published in form of a letter, these results support our findings. The incidence of hMPV in this and in our study is low compared to other respiratory viruses. In a similar previous study we found that Picornaviruses were detectable in 36% of AE-COPD patients, Influenza A in 25% and Respiratory syncytial virus in 22%[2]. There is another prospective cohort study of adults in which hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly from long term care facilities [17] . Unfortunately this report does not specify how many of the elderly patients suffered from COPD. In our asymptomatic smokers without COPD hMPV could not be detected. A recent study investigating nasal secretions from adults with and without respiratory illnesses found hMPV in 5 of 146 ill patient and in none of 158 control subjects, strongly supporting our data [24] . A further recent study found hMPV in two out of 111 adult patients (1.8%) who presented to the emergency department for AE-COPD during 2 winter/ spring seasons in Quebec, Canada, also in support of our findings [25] . In a US American study investigating clinical samples collected between 1991 and 1995, hMPV could not be detected at all in 196 patients indicating important geographical and seasonal differences in hMPV prevalence [26] . Taken together the results presented here are in keeping with other studies in adults and add important information on the prevalence of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. To our knowledge this is the first study analysing the viral load of hMPV in COPD patients. We found a mean of 6.5 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in induced sputum. These values indicate that hMPV may have been the infectious agent triggering exacerbation in these patients. Viral load cut-off values for infectivity in COPD exacerbations have not been studied in detail yet and need further investigation. However, viral loads between 1120 copies/ml in Cytomegalovirus infection in lung-transplant patients [27] and 5.8log 10 copies/ ml in SARS [28] have been considered to indicate infectious disease. Moreover hMPV was only found in acute exacerbation and not in stable disease or in smokers without COPD supporting a triggering role in AE-COPD. HMPV infection can be severe since it was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . Our hMPV positive patients did not differ in their clinical characteristics or lung function from the other AE-COPD patients which does not indicate a more severe course of AE-COPD in these patients. Taken together this is the first controlled study on the relevance of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. HMPV was detected in a very low frequency but with noticeable viral load in AE-COPD patients. Given that asymptomatic carriage of hMPV is very unlikely it should be considered as another possible trigger of AE-COPD. Since every AE-COPD has considerable impact on the course of the disease and regional outbreaks of hMPV are possible it should be included into future diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.  The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.",

         "Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey",
         "BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.",

         "In Japan, cancer has been recognized as a major component of the overall pattern of disease for decades. Thus, the importance of cancer prevention by lifestyle modification should now be strongly acknowledged. Internationally, several studies have estimated the proportion of total cancer deaths attributable to various risk factors based on epidemiologic evidence [1, 2] , and various international guidelines and recommendations derived from these have appeared [3] [4] [5] [6] . Not surprisingly, domestic guidelines and recommendations for cancer prevention in Japan such as the 'Twelve recommendations for cancer prevention [7]' and 'Healthy People Japan 21 [8] ' have been significantly influenced by these reports. Public awareness of risk factors in relation to cancer prevention has been surveyed in only a few countries [9, 10] , and results have demonstrated poor awareness. Other studies focusing on specific cancers only have also appeared [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, none of these studies quantitatively evaluated public awareness of the attributable fraction of individual risk factors. In Japan, it appears that most people are aware of the major risk factors of cancer. Although we are unaware of any published evidence, however, public knowledge and information on cancer prevention now seems influenced largely by the mass media and other sources, rather than by information provided directly by health professionals, resulting in a distorted picture of causation. Cancer control policy therefore urgently requires a clarification of the discrepancies which now exist between ideal levels of public concern about risk factors and the current reality, particularly public health policy makers in their formulation of cancer control measures. To address this need, the present study was designed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. Since we are interested in quantitatively estimating the awareness of preventability, we placed special emphasis on gauging awareness by attributable fraction of cancer. The study was conducted as a part of an omnibus survey in December, 2003, by commission to a polling agency. The omnibus survey is a monthly multipurpose cross-sectional survey which includes public opinion research, social research, scientific research, market research, and others. Using a stratified two-stage sampling method, a total of 2,000 people aged 20 or older were randomly selected as study subjects, from 160 districts selected from area units representing 12 geographical blocks (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Keihin, Koshinetu, Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Hanshin, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu) and 3 types of city scale (14 metropolises, other cities, towns and villages) in proportion to the population distribution as at March 2002. After an initial visit to obtain oral informed consent and schedule a visit for the interview, the survey was conducted by face-to-face interview using trained interviewers in each district. The omnibus survey does not collect any personally identifiable information such as name, date of birth or address details at interview. For the present report, we obtained the electronic data file for the relevant interview component, with no personal identifiers. Ethical approval was not applicable to the present study under the Japanese ethical guidelines for epidemiologic studies, which comply with the declaration of Helsinki. Among the 2,000 people selected for survey (977 men, 1,023 women), interviews were successfully obtained The questionnaire of this survey comprised questions on the awareness of various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention by enquiring about the attributable fraction of cancer. Fractions were: 1) 12 risk factor candidates, namely alcoholic beverages, unbalanced diet, use of food additives and pesticide chemicals, charred fish and meat, tobacco smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, air pollution such as diesel emissions, occupational exposure, cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection, and stress; 2) genetic factors in general; and 3) the preventable fraction of cancer occurrence by lifestyle modification [see Additional file 1]. The first question asked about the preventable fraction of cancer which would result in Japan if each factor were completely and totally eliminated, using the fine categories of <5%, 5 to <10%, 10 to <15%, 15 to <20%, 20 to <25%, 25 to <30%, 30 to <40%, 40 to <50%, 50 to <60%, 60 to <70%, 70 to <80%, 80 to <90%, and 90 to 100%. These categories were exhibited together on a pie chart. These risk factor candidates were selected with reference to previous international and domestic recommendations and guidelines [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The second question asked about the fraction of cancer genetically predetermined using the same categories as the first, while the third asked about the preventable fraction of cancer by modification of lifestyle using estimation of an actual percent value. In addition to these questions, subjects were also asked about their smoking and drinking practices, and occupational and educational status. Mean values of the attributable fractions were calculated for each risk factor of cancer and compared by demographic and habitual smoking and drinking status. For analyses, the mid-values of each category were assigned for categorical variables. All analyses were performed using Stata statistical software, S/E Version 8 [15] . A total of 1,355 (67.8%) subjects responded to the survey, with a higher response rate in women (72.9%) than in men (62.3%). Response rate was lower in the 20s age strata than in the other age groups, but no trend to an increase in response rate with increasing age was observed. Overall, no significant difference in area and age distribution was seen between the sampled population and survey respondents. Response rate tended to be lower among subjects who reside in the Kanto region and in cities other than the 14 metropolises than among other subjects ( Table 1) . Characteristics of the 1,355 respondents (609 men, 746 women) are presented in Table 2 . The proportion of current smokers was 44% in men and 15% in women, and decreased with age in both genders. In female subjects aged in their 20s, 26% currently smoke and 49% drink alcohol beverages at least 4 times a week. Awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population is presented in Table 3 . Among the 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction was considered highest for cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection (51.3%), followed by tobacco smoking (43.0%), stress (39.0%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37.1%). In contrast, the attributable fraction of charred fish and meat (21.4%) and alcohol drinking (21.7%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. The attributable fraction of other risk factor candidates such as occupational exposure, air pollution, food additives and pesticides, unbalanced diet, obesity and physical activity ranked between the high and low fractions. The attributable fraction responses tended to be higher in women than in men, and were increased among inhabitants of larger cities and in homemakers and decreased in those engaged in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, risk factor candidate rankings were similar by gender, age group, city scale, and educational and occupational status. In men, those who neither smoke nor drink tended to consider the preventive fraction of the risk factors higher than those who both smoke and drink, whereas in women, the former subjects considered the values lower than the latter. The speculated fraction of cancer which is genetically determined was 31.5% as an average (Table 3 ). This fraction was higher in current heavy smokers and former drinkers, and lower in homemakers and students. On the other hand, an average 35.5% of cancer were considered preventable by lifestyle improvement, with this ratio being higher in homemakers, former smokers, and never and former drinkers. The present survey, targeted at the Japanese general population, showed that the attributable fraction of cancer among Japanese tended to be higher for cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives than major lifestyle factors such as dietary factors. In addition, the attributable fraction of cancer estimated by the Japanese general population was higher than that derived from epidemiologic evidence in the West, which is frequently quoted as 30% for tobacco smoking and 30% for food as a whole [1, 2] . Some of the major cancers in Japan, including gastric and liver cancers, are known to be related to cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection, and a higher level of concern about such infection among Japanese than in Western populations would therefore be understandable [9] . Notwithstanding the validity of such concern, however, the high level of concern for infection, as well as for endocrine-disrupting chemicals, identified in the present survey was most likely due to the severe acute respiratory Likewise, a high level of concern for tobacco smoking was also observed, in spite of a relatively dull reduction in the rate of male current smokers in past decades compared with the U.S. This was probably due to recent enactment of the Health Promotion Law, which curbs passive smoking in public spaces. Respondent estimates for attributable fractions were generally high. This may be in part due to anchoring and adjustment effects of the response categories used and the tendency of people to respond near the middle of the scale. Given that responses tended to be generally high, concern over the present results should probably be focused on rankings rather than absolute values per se. Although tobacco smoking ranked among the top factors, risk factor candidates whose actual contribution is considered to be low, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, occupational exposure, air pollution such as diesel emissions and the use of food additives and pesticide chemicals ranked higher than previous estimates of the attributable fraction of cancer causes [1, 2] . In contrast, this should be compared with the results for unbalanced diet, which ranked at only 8th among the 12 risk factor candidates despite an actual ranking which is estimated to be as high as that for tobacco smoking. Particularly in light of findings on long-term exposure to common lifestyle factors such as diet as a cause of cancer, these results suggest that public awareness of cancer prevention is still insufficient. We are unaware of any previous studies aimed at determining public awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer as a whole or at gauging the level the awareness of cancer prevention by attributable fraction. Accordingly, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to discover the level of awareness for each risk factor candidate, and the questionnaire used has hence not been fully validated. In addition, as indicated above, responses to this type of cross sectional survey are subject to social conditions such as information from the mass media and other sources on disease epidemics and other putative risk factors. Thus, the results might not necessarily reflect actual public awareness. However, the study subjects were recruited from among a nationally representative random sample, and the response rate was similar to that of recent omnibus surveys in other countries [16] [17] [18] [19] . Nevertheless, the exclusion of non-respondents may have distorted the results. In conclusion, awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population tended to be dominated by infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than dietary factors. The results of the present survey provide valuable clues and perspectives toward the formulation of relevant cancer prevention strategies in Japan.",
         "Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey. BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.. In Japan, cancer has been recognized as a major component of the overall pattern of disease for decades. Thus, the importance of cancer prevention by lifestyle modification should now be strongly acknowledged. Internationally, several studies have estimated the proportion of total cancer deaths attributable to various risk factors based on epidemiologic evidence [1, 2] , and various international guidelines and recommendations derived from these have appeared [3] [4] [5] [6] . Not surprisingly, domestic guidelines and recommendations for cancer prevention in Japan such as the 'Twelve recommendations for cancer prevention [7]' and 'Healthy People Japan 21 [8] ' have been significantly influenced by these reports. Public awareness of risk factors in relation to cancer prevention has been surveyed in only a few countries [9, 10] , and results have demonstrated poor awareness. Other studies focusing on specific cancers only have also appeared [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, none of these studies quantitatively evaluated public awareness of the attributable fraction of individual risk factors. In Japan, it appears that most people are aware of the major risk factors of cancer. Although we are unaware of any published evidence, however, public knowledge and information on cancer prevention now seems influenced largely by the mass media and other sources, rather than by information provided directly by health professionals, resulting in a distorted picture of causation.

         "Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung",
         "To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.",

         "A. miRNA definition, biology and function Discovery of microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 was the first short non-coding RNA discovered in 1993 as a regulator of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans [1] . The first non-coding RNA identified in humans was let-7, which has been found involved in the control of developmental timing in humans and animals [2, 3] . Soon it became evident that these short non-coding RNAs are a part of much larger class of non-coding RNAs and the term microRNA (miRNA) was introduced [4] . To date, more than 900 miRNAs in Homo sapiens have been identified (940 in miRBase v15). MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs~22 nucleotides (nt) long involved in the negative post-transcriptional gene regulation via RNA interference mechanism [5, 6] . The sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among plants-microorganisms-animals, suggesting that miRNAs represent a relatively old and important regulatory pathway [7] . MiRNAs belong to the most abundant class of human gene regulators [8] : up to a third of the human genes are regulated by miRNAs [9] . MiRNAs are, therefore, key regulators of numerous genes in biological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis [e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ]. It has been speculated that miRNAs may be associated with the regulation of almost every aspect of cell physiology [8] . MiRNA genes are localized in the non-coding regions or in the introns of protein-coding genes in the genomic DNA. The miRNA genes are much longer than biologically active, mature miRNAs which originate through a multistep process [15] (Figure 1 ). Briefly, transcription by the RNA polymerase II leads to hundred or thousand nucleotides long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) [16] . A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/ Pasha to 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) [17] in a process known as \"cropping\" [18, 19] . Pre-miRNAs are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [20, 21] . In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes [17, 20] . One strand of the short-lived miRNA duplex is degraded (\"passenger\" strand, miR*), whereas the other (\"guide\", miR) strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA [8] . Selection of the \"guide\" strand is based on the base pairing stability of both dsRNA ends [22, 23] . Depending on the complementarity between miRNA and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA there are two known mechanisms of miRNAs action on mRNAs: 1) target mRNA degradation and 2) translational inhibition with little or no influence on mRNA levels [24] (Figure 2) . Firstly, the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of the target mRNA occurs when miRNA is near-perfectly complementary with target mRNA [25, 26] . A recent study proved that mRNA degradation represents the major mechanism of miRNA regulation [27] . The authors showed that about 84% of all protein-coding mRNA targets undergo degradation while recognized by their cognate miRNA [27] . Secondly, the translational inhibition MiRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from the genomic DNA as long (hundred or thousand nucleotides) primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/Pasha to produce a 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs in form of hairpins are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes, consisting of the \"guide\" (miR) strand and the \"passenger\" (miR*) strand. The \"passenger\" strand is degraded, the \"guide\" strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA, acting by two different mechanisms according to the complementarity with the target mRNA. Adopted from Kim [15] . occurs when miRNA is only partially complementary to its target mRNA [28] [29] [30] . In light of the recent study by Guo et al [27] , this mechanism does not represent a predominant reason for reduced protein output. Besides the complementarity between miRNA and mRNA, several other factors may influence the miRNA action such as impaired processing, methylation, gene polymorphisms, gene amplification, deletion of Dicer, translocations and others [31] . It is evident that single miRNAs may regulate translation of numerous downstream mRNAs and each mRNA is likely to be regulated by several miRNAs simultaneously [30, 32] . Thus, identification of miRNA target genes has been a great challenge [33] . Numerous computational algorithms [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] were established which combined 5' seed matches, thermodynamic stability and conservation analysis in order to maximize specificity when predicting mRNA targets [44] (Table 1) . Nevertheless, various algorithms differ in the selection of mRNA targets and simultaneous application of several algorithms is, therefore, highly recommended. Nowadays, many web-based applications [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] have been developed by combining existing prediction programs with functional annotations associated to many miRNA, gene, protein or biological pathway resources such as miR-Base, Ensembl, Swiss-Prot, UCSC genome browser, KEGG pathway and other databases [44] (Table 2) . However, because of high similarities in miRNA sequences, computational algorithms may predict a large number of putative miRNA binding sites on mRNA targets [33] . Thus, experimental validation in biological system is fundamental to complete the target prediction [44] ; the currently available methods [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] are listed in Table 3 . Of these, antagomir studies or immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs have been specifically developed for miRNA-mRNA studies. Antagomirs represent a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides used to silence endogenous microRNAs [64, 65] . Immunoprecipitation is then based on the observation that each member of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family (catalytic components of the RNA-induced silencing complex) can bind to miRNAs and to partially complementary sequences in the 3'-UTR of specific target mRNAs. Thus, using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against members of the Ago protein family, Ago-bound mRNAs can be co-immunoprecipitated [66, 67] . The lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile, highly conserved across mammalian species [68, 69] . However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung compartment is still limited and it is based mainly on the studies in animal models. MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in 1) the lung development and homeostasis, 2) in inflammation and viral infections and 3) miRNA deregulation may contribute to several pulmonary diseases ( Figure 3 ). Hereby, we summarize the knowledge of the involvement of miRNAs in the lung and current information on their posttranscriptional regulation ongoing in the lung compartment. Besides pathology we pay attention also to physiological lung because understanding miRNA function in normal condition is prerequisite to description of its involvement in disease. Several miRNAs such as miR-155, miR-26a, let-7, miR-29, miR-15/miR-16, miR-223, miR-146a/b and the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to be involved in homeostasis and in the lung development ( Table 4 ). The pulmonary role of miR-155 was studied in murine lung, where it has been shown that miR-155 is crucially involved in the differentiation of naive T-cells into Th1 and Th2 cells [70, 71] . Mice deficient in bic/miR-155 became immunodeficient and displayed increased lung remodelling, higher bronchoalveolar leukocytes and impaired T-and B-cell responses to inflammatory stimuli [70] . Another member of miRNA family, miR-26a, has been shown to be selectively expressed in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in murine lung [72] . Target mRNA of miR-26a is the transcription factor SMAD1, which is involved in the regulation of bone morphogenic protein signalling during lung development and pulmonary vascular remodelling [73, 74] . Thus, miR-26a might be important in controlling essential developmental and physiological events in the lung [75] . Also the miR-17-92 cluster is believed to regulate the lung development because its expression is high in embryonic development and steadily declines through development into adulthood [76] . Mice deficient in the miR-17-92 cluster died shortly after birth and lung hypoplasia/ventricular septal defects were demonstrated; moreover the absence of the miR-17-92 cluster let to upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and inhibition of B-cell development [77] . On the other side, the overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster in murine models resulted in an abnormal phenotype manifested by absence of terminal air sacs, which were replaced by highly proliferative, undifferentiated pulmonary epithelium [76] . Other miRNAs found to be involved in the pulmonary homeostasis are members of let-7 family [78] , miR-29 [79] , miR-15 and miR-16 [80, 81] , which Northern blot analysis [54] Quantitative real-time PCR [55] Ribonuclease protection assay [56] in situ hybridization [57] , [58] miRNA mimics [59] Western blot [60] Immunocytochemistry [61] Bead-based flow cytometry method [62] Suppression of miRNA expression in cells by antisense locked-nucleic acid oligonucleotides [63] Antagomir assays [64] , [65] Immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs [66] , [67] function as tumor suppressors in lung cells. In addition, another miRNA, miR-223, has been shown to be crucial for normal granulocyte development and function in the lung [82] . MiR-223 mutant mice spontaneously developed neutrophilic lung inflammation with tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge [82] . Two miRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b, have been shown to play central role in the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation; the mechanism is down-regulation of two proteins IRAK1 and TRAF6 involved in Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) signalling [83, 84] . Also other miRNAs have been shown to regulate the inflammation in mouse lung exposed to aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS): miR-21, -25, -27b, -100, -140, -142-3p, -181c, -187, -194, -214, -223 and -224 [72] . Increase in these miRNAs correlated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as TNFα [72] . The deregulation of miR-155, the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-223, miRNAs involved in lung development and homeostasis, resulted in the uncontrolled lung inflammation in murine models [70, 77, 82] . Based on the studies in murine models, there is evidence that miRNA expression may influence also the course of pulmonary viral infections [85, 86] . MiR-200a and miR-223 were detected in lethal influenza virus infection presumably contributing to the extreme miR-155 important for normal lung airway remodelling (A) [70] alteration of T-cell differentiation (A) [71] miR-26a highly expressed within bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, important for lung development (H) [75] let-7 highly expressed in normal lung tissue, functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [78] miR-29 functions as tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [79] miR-15, miR-16 function as tumor suppressor genes (H) [80] , [81] miR-223 control of granulocyte development and function (A) [82] miR-146a/b central to the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation (H) [83] , [84] miR-200a, miR-223 contribution to the extreme virulence of the r1918 influenza virus (A) [85] miR-17 family, miR-574-5p, miR-214 upregulated at the onset of SARS infection (A, H) [86] virulence of the r1918 influenza virus [85] . MiR-17 family, miR-574-5p and miR-214 were upregulated at the onset of SARS infection: these miRNAs may help the virus to evade the host immune system and are responsible for effective transmission at the initial stage of viral infection [86] . There is evidence that upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs is critical for the lung development/homeostasis and thus may contribute to development of pathological pulmonary conditions, namely to smokingrelated diseases including lung cancerogenesis, fibrosis, and other immune-mediated disorders including allergy (Table 5) . Recent studies have implicated the miRNAs in the pathogenesis of immune system mediated pulmonary diseases. Tan and colleagues [87] described that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-G, a known asthma-susceptibility gene, disrupts the binding sites of three miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-148b, miR-152) targeting this gene. Thus, it is likely that the association of the HLA-G gene to asthma-susceptibility may be due to the allele-specific regulation of this gene by miRNAs [87] . MiR-21 is a further miRNA crucially involved in allergic lung inflammation. Its molecular target is IL-12p35, a cytokine contributing to polarization of Th cells toward Th2 cells [88] . MiR-126 is another miRNA found to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airways disease [89] . The blockade of miR-126 suppressed the asthmatic phenotype leading to diminished Th2 responses, suppression of inflammation, reduced airways hyperresponsiveness, inhibition of eosinophil recruitment, and lower mucus hypersecretion [89] . In bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα, let-7, miR-29a and miR-155 have been involved in the regulation of allergic inflammation [90] . Multiple members of let-7 family were also found upregulated in experimental asthma model and the pro-inflammatory role of let-7 miRNAs on the allergic cytokine expression was confirmed [91] . Another study showed that expression of RhoA in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs), a new target for asthma therapy, is negatively regulated by miR-133a [92] . The same group later revealed that IL-13 is capable of reducing the miR-133a expression in BSMCs and that the miR-133a downregulation causes an Table 5 MiRNAs involved in pathological processes in the lung miRNA Function (A animal studies, H human studies) References miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster deregulation results in uncontrolled inflammation (A) [70] , [71] , [77] miR-21, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-181c, miR-223, miR-224 increased following exposure to LPS (A) [72] miR-155 overexpressed in solid tumors, inhibition of tumor suppressor genes (A, H) [81] miR-223 impaired granulocyte function, regulator of granulocyte production and inflammatory response (A) [82] miR-148a/b, miR-152 allele-specific regulation of asthma susceptibility HLA-G gene (H) [87] miR-21 key role in asthma (A) [88] overexpressed in solid malignancies (A, H) [103] up-regulated in bleomycin-induced fibrosis and IPF (A, H) [110] miR-126 suppression of the asthmatic phenotype by blockade of miR-126 (A) [89] downregulated in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (H) [111] let-7, miR-29a, miR-155 regulation of allergic inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells (A, H) [90] let-7 pro-inflammatory effect in experimental asthma (A) [91] role in lung cancer progression (H) [99] miR-133a regulator of expression of RhoA, target for asthma therapy (A, H) [92] , [93] miR-146a reduced expression in COPD fibroblasts (H) [95] miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294 deregulated due to smoking (A, H) [96, 97] miR-218 tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (H) [98] miR-17-92 cluster overexpressed in lung cancers (H) [102] miR-34 regulation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells (H) [105] [106] [107] miR-210 overexpressed in lung cancer (H) [108] let-7d pro-fibrotic effect in pulmonary fibrosis (A, H) [109] upregulation of RhoA, presumably resulting in an augmentation of the contraction [93] . Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure [94] . Although extensive studies of the involvement of miRNAs in lung cancer have been performed, there are only few reports focused on the role of miRNAs in COPD. Recent study on fibroblasts from COPD subjects stimulated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines released less miR-146a than smokers without COPD [95] . The reduced miR-146a expression resulted in prolonged mRNA half-life of cyclooxygenase-2, thus increasing prostaglandin E2 in fibroblasts from COPD subjects [95] . There is evidence that smoking has influence also on other miRNAs. Expression profiling study in the rats exposed to environmental cigarette smoke revealed 24 downregulated miRNAs (especially let-7 family, miR-10, [96] . MiR-294, a known inhibitor of transcriptional repressor genes, was the only miRNA upregulated in smoke-exposed rats [96] . In another study, bronchial airway epithelial cells from current and never smokers differed in the expression of 28 miRNAs (especially miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294) in comparison to smokers, whereas the majority of deregulated miRNAs were downregulated in smokers [97] . Similar observation was observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where downregulation of miR-218 was associated with a history of cigarette smoking [98] . However, the majority of miRNA studies in smokingrelated diseases are focused on the role of miRNAs in lung cancer. Altered expression of miR-155 and let-7 has been reported in lung adenocarcinoma and expression of let-7 related to patient survival [99] . Moreover, it has been shown that let-7 may also play a role in lung cancer progression [99] [100] [101] . Further, increased expression of the miR-17-92 cluster has also been detected in lung cancer [102] . Another miRNAs involved in lung cancerogenesis are miR-21 and miR-34 families. MiR-21 was shown to regulate multiple tumor/metastasis suppressor genes in lung solid tumors [103] . MiR-34a/b/c have been identified to be a component of the p53 tumor suppressor network: p53 upregulates in response to DNA damage the members of miR-34 family [104] , thus regulating genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis [105] [106] [107] . Furthermore, miR-210 has been overexpressed in late stages of lung cancer, thus mediated mitochondrial alterations associated with modulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity [108] . Next, miR-218 was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer [98] . Recently, it was reported that miRNAs may play pivotal regulatory role also in the fibrotic processes ongoing in the lung: the downregulation of let-7 d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in the pro-fibrotic effects [109] . Also, upregulation of miR-21 was reported in the lungs of IPF patients and in the murine lungs with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas miR-21 expression was enhanced by pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 [110] . Another disease associated with miRNA change was cystic fibrosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was detected in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and its expression correlated with upregulation of TOM1 mRNA both in vitro and in vivo [111] . TOM1, a miR-126 target, was reported to be involved in the regulation of innate immune responses through its involvement in the TLR2/4 and IL-1β and TNF-α-induced signalling pathways [111] . Small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal role in the posttranscriptional regulation of numerous human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. There is evidence that the lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile undergoing changes during the lung development. Studies namely in animal models have provided evidence that miRNAs participate in lung homeostasis and play pivotal role also in the control of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections. Recent studies showed evidence that upregulated or downregulated expression of various miRNAs play an active role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Specific miRNA expression profiles were characterized for smoking related-diseases including COPD and lung cancer, immune-mediated pulmonary diseases and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, several miRNAs crucial for lung development and homeostasis such as let-7, miR-155 or miR-19-72 cluster have been identified to be deregulated in pulmonary allergy, asthma or lung cancer. The knowledge of altered miRNA expression profiles in diseased lung may thus offer new insights in the biology of pulmonary diseases. Moreover, miRNAs may represent attractive novel diagnostic biomarkers mainly due to their higher stability when compared to mRNAs [112] and could potentially provide possibilities for therapeutic intervention [31, 113, 114] .",
         "Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung. To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.. A. miRNA definition, biology and function Discovery of microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 was the first short non-coding RNA discovered in 1993 as a regulator of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans [1] . The first non-coding RNA identified in humans was let-7, which has been found involved in the control of developmental timing in humans and animals [2, 3] . Soon it became evident that these short non-coding RNAs are a part of much larger class of non-coding RNAs and the term microRNA (miRNA) was introduced [4] . To date, more than 900 miRNAs in Homo sapiens have been identified (940 in miRBase v15). MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs~22 nucleotides (nt) long involved in the negative post-transcriptional gene regulation via RNA interference mechanism [5, 6] . The sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among plants-microorganisms-animals, suggesting that miRNAs represent a relatively old and important regulatory pathway [7] . MiRNAs belong to the most abundant class of human gene regulators [8] : up to a third of the human genes are regulated by miRNAs [9] . MiRNAs are, therefore, key regulators of numerous genes in biological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis [e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ]. It has been speculated that miRNAs may be associated with the regulation of almost every aspect of cell physiology [8] . MiRNA genes are localized in the non-coding regions or in the introns of protein-coding genes in the genomic DNA. The miRNA genes are much longer than biologically active, mature miRNAs which originate through a multistep process [15] (Figure 1 ). Briefly, transcription by the RNA polymerase II leads to hundred or thousand nucleotides long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) [16] . A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/ Pasha to 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) [17] in a process known as \"cropping\" [18, 19] . Pre-miRNAs are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [20, 21] . In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes [17, 20] . One strand of the short-lived miRNA duplex is degraded (\"passenger\" strand, miR*), whereas the other (\"guide\", miR) strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA [8] . Selection of the \"guide\" strand is based on the base pairing stability of both dsRNA ends [22, 23] . Depending on the complementarity between miRNA and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA there are two known mechanisms of miRNAs action on mRNAs: 1) target mRNA degradation and 2) translational inhibition with little or no influence on mRNA levels [24] (Figure 2) . Firstly, the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of the target mRNA occurs when miRNA is near-perfectly complementary with target mRNA [25, 26] . A recent study proved that mRNA degradation represents the major mechanism of miRNA regulation [27] . The authors showed that about 84% of all protein-coding mRNA targets undergo degradation while recognized by their cognate miRNA [27] . Secondly, the translational inhibition MiRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from the genomic DNA as long (hundred or thousand nucleotides) primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/Pasha to produce a 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs in form of hairpins are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes, consisting of the \"guide\" (miR) strand and the \"passenger\" (miR*) strand. The \"passenger\" strand is degraded, the \"guide\" strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA, acting by two different mechanisms according to the complementarity with the target mRNA. Adopted from Kim [15] . occurs when miRNA is only partially complementary to its target mRNA [28] [29] [30] . In light of the recent study by Guo et al [27] , this mechanism does not represent a predominant reason for reduced protein output. Besides the complementarity between miRNA and mRNA, several other factors may influence the miRNA action such as impaired processing, methylation, gene polymorphisms, gene amplification, deletion of Dicer, translocations and others [31] . It is evident that single miRNAs may regulate translation of numerous downstream mRNAs and each mRNA is likely to be regulated by several miRNAs simultaneously [30, 32] . Thus, identification of miRNA target genes has been a great challenge [33] . Numerous computational algorithms [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] were established which combined 5' seed matches, thermodynamic stability and conservation analysis in order to maximize specificity when predicting mRNA targets [44] (Table 1) . Nevertheless, various algorithms differ in the selection of mRNA targets and simultaneous application of several algorithms is, therefore, highly recommended. Nowadays, many web-based applications [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] have been developed by combining existing prediction programs with functional annotations associated to many miRNA, gene, protein or biological pathway resources such as miR-Base, Ensembl, Swiss-Prot, UCSC genome browser, KEGG pathway and other databases [44] (Table 2) . However, because of high similarities in miRNA sequences, computational algorithms may predict a large number of putative miRNA binding sites on mRNA targets [33] . Thus, experimental validation in biological system is fundamental to complete the target prediction [44] ; the currently available methods [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] are listed in Table 3 . Of these, antagomir studies or immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs have been specifically developed for miRNA-mRNA studies. Antagomirs represent a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides used to silence endogenous microRNAs [64, 65] . Immunoprecipitation is then based on the observation that each member of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family (catalytic components of the RNA-induced silencing complex) can bind to miRNAs and to partially complementary sequences in the 3'-UTR of specific target mRNAs. Thus, using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against members of the Ago protein family, Ago-bound mRNAs can be co-immunoprecipitated [66, 67] . The lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile, highly conserved across mammalian species [68, 69] . However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung compartment is still limited and it is based mainly on the studies in animal models. MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in 1) the lung development and homeostasis, 2) in inflammation and viral infections and 3) miRNA deregulation may contribute to several pulmonary diseases ( Figure 3 ). Hereby, we summarize the knowledge of the involvement of miRNAs in the lung and current information on their posttranscriptional regulation ongoing in the lung compartment. Besides pathology we pay attention also to physiological lung because understanding miRNA function in normal condition is prerequisite to description of its involvement in disease. Several miRNAs such as miR-155, miR-26a, let-7, miR-29, miR-15/miR-16, miR-223, miR-146a/b and the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to be involved in homeostasis and in the lung development ( Table 4 ). The pulmonary role of miR-155 was studied in murine lung, where it has been shown that miR-155 is crucially involved in the differentiation of naive T-cells into Th1 and Th2 cells [70, 71] . Mice deficient in bic/miR-155 became immunodeficient and displayed increased lung remodelling, higher bronchoalveolar leukocytes and impaired T-and B-cell responses to inflammatory stimuli [70] . Another member of miRNA family, miR-26a, has been shown to be selectively expressed in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in murine lung [72] . Target mRNA of miR-26a is the transcription factor SMAD1, which is involved in the regulation of bone morphogenic protein signalling during lung development and pulmonary vascular remodelling [73, 74] . Thus, miR-26a might be important in controlling essential developmental and physiological events in the lung [75] . Also the miR-17-92 cluster is believed to regulate the lung development because its expression is high in embryonic development and steadily declines through development into adulthood [76] . Mice deficient in the miR-17-92 cluster died shortly after birth and lung hypoplasia/ventricular septal defects were demonstrated; moreover the absence of the miR-17-92 cluster let to upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and inhibition of B-cell development [77] . On the other side, the overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster in murine models resulted in an abnormal phenotype manifested by absence of terminal air sacs, which were replaced by highly proliferative, undifferentiated pulmonary epithelium [76] . Other miRNAs found to be involved in the pulmonary homeostasis are members of let-7 family [78] , miR-29 [79] , miR-15 and miR-16 [80, 81] , which Northern blot analysis [54] Quantitative real-time PCR [55] Ribonuclease protection assay [56] in situ hybridization [57] , [58] miRNA mimics [59] Western blot [60] Immunocytochemistry [61] Bead-based flow cytometry method [62] Suppression of miRNA expression in cells by antisense locked-nucleic acid oligonucleotides [63] Antagomir assays [64] , [65] Immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs [66] , [67] function as tumor suppressors in lung cells. In addition, another miRNA, miR-223, has been shown to be crucial for normal granulocyte development and function in the lung [82] . MiR-223 mutant mice spontaneously developed neutrophilic lung inflammation with tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge [82] . Two miRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b, have been shown to play central role in the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation; the mechanism is down-regulation of two proteins IRAK1 and TRAF6 involved in Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) signalling [83, 84] . Also other miRNAs have been shown to regulate the inflammation in mouse lung exposed to aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS): miR-21, -25, -27b, -100, -140, -142-3p, -181c, -187, -194, -214, -223 and -224 [72] . Increase in these miRNAs correlated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as TNFα [72] . The deregulation of miR-155, the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-223, miRNAs involved in lung development and homeostasis, resulted in the uncontrolled lung inflammation in murine models [70, 77, 82] . Based on the studies in murine models, there is evidence that miRNA expression may influence also the course of pulmonary viral infections [85, 86] . MiR-200a and miR-223 were detected in lethal influenza virus infection presumably contributing to the extreme miR-155 important for normal lung airway remodelling (A) [70] alteration of T-cell differentiation (A) [71] miR-26a highly expressed within bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, important for lung development (H) [75] let-7 highly expressed in normal lung tissue, functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [78] miR-29 functions as tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [79] miR-15, miR-16 function as tumor suppressor genes (H) [80] , [81] miR-223 control of granulocyte development and function (A) [82] miR-146a/b central to the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation (H) [83] , [84] miR-200a, miR-223 contribution to the extreme virulence of the r1918 influenza virus (A) [85] miR-17 family, miR-574-5p, miR-214 upregulated at the onset of SARS infection (A, H) [86] virulence of the r1918 influenza virus [85] . MiR-17 family, miR-574-5p and miR-214 were upregulated at the onset of SARS infection: these miRNAs may help the virus to evade the host immune system and are responsible for effective transmission at the initial stage of viral infection [86] . There is evidence that upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs is critical for the lung development/homeostasis and thus may contribute to development of pathological pulmonary conditions, namely to smokingrelated diseases including lung cancerogenesis, fibrosis, and other immune-mediated disorders including allergy (Table 5) . Recent studies have implicated the miRNAs in the pathogenesis of immune system mediated pulmonary diseases. Tan and colleagues [87] described that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-G, a known asthma-susceptibility gene, disrupts the binding sites of three miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-148b, miR-152) targeting this gene. Thus, it is likely that the association of the HLA-G gene to asthma-susceptibility may be due to the allele-specific regulation of this gene by miRNAs [87] . MiR-21 is a further miRNA crucially involved in allergic lung inflammation. Its molecular target is IL-12p35, a cytokine contributing to polarization of Th cells toward Th2 cells [88] . MiR-126 is another miRNA found to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airways disease [89] . The blockade of miR-126 suppressed the asthmatic phenotype leading to diminished Th2 responses, suppression of inflammation, reduced airways hyperresponsiveness, inhibition of eosinophil recruitment, and lower mucus hypersecretion [89] . In bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα, let-7, miR-29a and miR-155 have been involved in the regulation of allergic inflammation [90] . Multiple members of let-7 family were also found upregulated in experimental asthma model and the pro-inflammatory role of let-7 miRNAs on the allergic cytokine expression was confirmed [91] . Another study showed that expression of RhoA in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs), a new target for asthma therapy, is negatively regulated by miR-133a [92] . The same group later revealed that IL-13 is capable of reducing the miR-133a expression in BSMCs and that the miR-133a downregulation causes an Table 5 MiRNAs involved in pathological processes in the lung miRNA Function (A animal studies, H human studies) References miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster deregulation results in uncontrolled inflammation (A) [70] , [71] , [77] miR-21, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-181c, miR-223, miR-224 increased following exposure to LPS (A) [72] miR-155 overexpressed in solid tumors, inhibition of tumor suppressor genes (A, H) [81] miR-223 impaired granulocyte function, regulator of granulocyte production and inflammatory response (A) [82] miR-148a/b, miR-152 allele-specific regulation of asthma susceptibility HLA-G gene (H) [87] miR-21 key role in asthma (A) [88] overexpressed in solid malignancies (A, H) [103] up-regulated in bleomycin-induced fibrosis and IPF (A, H) [110] miR-126 suppression of the asthmatic phenotype by blockade of miR-126 (A) [89] downregulated in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (H) [111] let-7, miR-29a, miR-155 regulation of allergic inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells (A, H) [90] let-7 pro-inflammatory effect in experimental asthma (A) [91] role in lung cancer progression (H) [99] miR-133a regulator of expression of RhoA, target for asthma therapy (A, H) [92] , [93] miR-146a reduced expression in COPD fibroblasts (H) [95] miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294 deregulated due to smoking (A, H) [96, 97] miR-218 tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (H) [98] miR-17-92 cluster overexpressed in lung cancers (H) [102] miR-34 regulation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells (H) [105] [106] [107] miR-210 overexpressed in lung cancer (H) [108] let-7d pro-fibrotic effect in pulmonary fibrosis (A, H) [109] upregulation of RhoA, presumably resulting in an augmentation of the contraction [93] . Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure [94] . Although extensive studies of the involvement of miRNAs in lung cancer have been performed, there are only few reports focused on the role of miRNAs in COPD. Recent study on fibroblasts from COPD subjects stimulated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines released less miR-146a than smokers without COPD [95] .

Altered expression of miR-155 and let-7 has been reported in lung adenocarcinoma and expression of let-7 related to patient survival [99] . Moreover, it has been shown that let-7 may also play a role in lung cancer progression [99] [100] [101] . Further, increased expression of the miR-17-92 cluster has also been detected in lung cancer [102] . Another miRNAs involved in lung cancerogenesis are miR-21 and miR-34 families. MiR-21 was shown to regulate multiple tumor/metastasis suppressor genes in lung solid tumors [103] . MiR-34a/b/c have been identified to be a component of the p53 tumor suppressor network: p53 upregulates in response to DNA damage the members of miR-34 family [104] , thus regulating genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis [105] [106] [107] . Furthermore, miR-210 has been overexpressed in late stages of lung cancer, thus mediated mitochondrial alterations associated with modulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity [108] . Next, miR-218 was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer [98] . Recently, it was reported that miRNAs may play pivotal regulatory role also in the fibrotic processes ongoing in the lung: the downregulation of let-7 d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in the pro-fibrotic effects [109] . Also, upregulation of miR-21 was reported in the lungs of IPF patients and in the murine lungs with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas miR-21 expression was enhanced by pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 [110] . Another disease associated with miRNA change was cystic fibrosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was detected in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and its expression correlated with upregulation of TOM1 mRNA both in vitro and in vivo [111] . TOM1, a miR-126 target, was reported to be involved in the regulation of innate immune responses through its involvement in the TLR2/4 and IL-1β and TNF-α-induced signalling pathways [111] . Small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal role in the posttranscriptional regulation of numerous human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. There is evidence that the lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile undergoing changes during the lung development. Studies namely in animal models have provided evidence that miRNAs participate in lung homeostasis and play pivotal role also in the control of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections. Recent studies showed evidence that upregulated or downregulated expression of various miRNAs play an active role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Specific miRNA expression profiles were characterized for smoking related-diseases including COPD and lung cancer, immune-mediated pulmonary diseases and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, several miRNAs crucial for lung development and homeostasis such as let-7, miR-155 or miR-19-72 cluster have been identified to be deregulated in pulmonary allergy, asthma or lung cancer. The knowledge of altered miRNA expression profiles in diseased lung may thus offer new insights in the biology of pulmonary diseases. Moreover, miRNAs may represent attractive novel diagnostic biomarkers mainly due to their higher stability when compared to mRNAs [112] and could potentially provide possibilities for therapeutic intervention [31, 113, 114] .",

         "A series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1–24 were prepared and first evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aR-configuration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus.",

         "Plant viruses cause numerous diseases in a wide range of crop plant species and lead to an estimated $600 billion in annual losses worldwide [1] . Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of Tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world and has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. Most TMVs have infected a number of economically important crops and have induced general mosaic symptoms to cause significant economic losses worldwide [2] . It is found that in certain fields 90-100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. Therefore, this plant virus has the name ''plant cancer'' and is difficult to control. To control viral plant diseases, many approaches have been used, including chemicals, breeding, cross-protection and transgenic plants. However, there are no control measures that can totally inhibit plant viruses after they have infected plants. Ningnanmycin (Figure 1) , perhaps the most successful registered antiplant viral agent, displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 mg/mL. Ribavirin (Figure 1 ) is another widely used plantviral inhibitor, its inhibitory effects are also less than 50% at 500 mg/mL. Because of the unsatisfactory cure rate (30-60%) of common antiviral agents (Ningnanmycin, Ribavirin, Virus A, et al.) and economic loss of tobacco, many efforts have been done to develop novel, potent and structure concise antiviral agents. Some chemicals, such as triazolyl compounds [3] , pyrazole derivatives [4, 5] , cyanoacrylate derivatives [5, 6] , a-aminophosphonate derivatives [5, 7] , N-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-N9-phenylureas [8] , and some natural products [9] [10] [11] , have been found to possess antiviral activity. However, there are only a few reports on economically viable antiviral chemicals available for application in agriculture [12] , so there still lies a great deal of scope for further research in this field. Natural product-based agrochemicals offer advantages in that they can sometimes be specific to a target species and often have unique modes of action with little mammalian toxicity. Another benefit is their ability to decompose rapidly, thereby reducing their risk to the environment [13, 14] . An additional advantage is the natural products can be a candidate that possesses the desirable biological activities. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids are a small group of alkaloids existing in the Lauraceae, Vitaceae and Urticaceae family of plants. Only five of these alkaloids ((R)-cryptopleurine (2), (R)-boehmeriasin A (5), boehmeriasin B (18) , cryptopleuridine and (14aR,15R)-15-hydroxycryptopleurine (19) , Figure 1 ) have been isolated by now [15] [16] [17] [18] . It has been reported that these alkaloids possess unique and interesting biological properties including vesicant [15] , antimicrobial [19] , antiviral [20, 21] and anti-tumor [22] [23] [24] activities. To date, most of the studies have been focused on antitumor activity in medicinal formulation. However, there have been no reports about the anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids in pesticide formulation. In our previous work, the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid (2)antofine ( Figure 1 ) was isolated from the aerial parts of Cynanchum komarovii and was first found to have good antiviral activity against TMV in vitro [25] . Further antiviral mechanism studies revealed that antofine has favorable interaction with origin of TMV RNA (oriRNA), likely exerting its virus inhibition by binding to oriRNA and interfering with virus assembly initiation [26] . Although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . Did the phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids possess anti-TMV activity? Based on the above findings, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were prepared and systematically evaluated for their antiviral activity against TMV. The alkaloids 1-9 [27] , 18 [28] , 19-24 [27] and acids 25a-f [24] were prepared according to the corresponding reported procedures. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10-17 were synthesized by using a practical synthetic approach involving coupling of the phenanthrene ring with 2-bromopyridine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction and subsequent reduction of the resulting pyridyl ketone as key steps. As shown in Figure 2 , 2-bromopyridine was treated with n-BuLi at -78uC to afford 2-lithiopyridine, which reacted smoothly with 25a-f to give pyridyl ketones 26a-f, respectively. By using PtO 2 as the catalyst, the hydrogenation of 26a-e proceeded smoothly in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 50 atm to give 27a-e, respectively. It should be noted that pyridyl ketone 26f could not been reduced under above reduction condition. The reduction of 27a-e in Et 3 SiH/TFA at reflux afforded 28a-e, which were then converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 10-14, respectively, by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation. The hydrogenation of 26f was carried out at several different conditions. The best result is that treatment of compound 26f with PtO 2 in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 4:1) at 50 atm gave the carbonyl group reduced intermediate 29 in 53% yield. Reduction of 29 using the similar procedure for the preparation of 27a-e gave the key intermediate 30 in 92% yield, which was converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 15 by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation ( Figure 3) . In order to further evaluate the effect of 6-hydroxy group on antiviral activity, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 16 and 17 were designed and synthesized. Phenanthrene-9-carboxylic acid 34 was synthesized by employing 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetic acid and 4hydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting materials ( Figure 4) . Ester 33 was obtained by the conventional four steps previously reported in the literature [29] . Then hydrolysis of ester 33 gave acid 34, which was treated with 2-lithiopyridine to afford the desired ketone 35. The catalytic hydrogenation of 35 to give 38 was carried out under two different procedures. Treatment of compound 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst in reluxing methanol at 1 atm gave the alcohol 36 in 83% yield. Reduction of 36 using the Et 3 SiH/TFA system afforded the desired product 37, which was further reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 10 atm gave 38 in 82% yield. For another method, treatment of ketone 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org in reluxing acetic acid at 1 atm gave the key intermediate 38 in 59% yield. Then amino and phenol protection and Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation proceeded sequentially to give 40, which deprotection afforded phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 16 in 69% yield ( Figure 4) . Treatment of pyridine 37 with cyclopropylmethyl bromide obtained 41, which was reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in ethanol and conc. HCl (v/v 20:1) at 50 atm to afford the key intermediate 42. The Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation of 42 gave phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 17 in 80% yield ( Figure 5 ). The phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were first tested for their phytotoxic activity against the test plant, and the results indicated that these natural product-based compounds showed no phytotoxic activity at 500 mg/mL. The commercial plant virucide Ningnanmycin, perhaps the most successful registered anti-plant viral agent, Ribavirin and (R)antofine were used as the controls. In order to investigate the subsituent effects of phenanthrene moiety, a series of racemic phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1, 4, 7, and 10-18 were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activity (Table 1) . To our delight, all the racemic phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids displayed higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, of which cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin, thus emerged as novel potent lead compounds for anti-TMV agents. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. Cryptopleurine (1) exhibited significantly higher activity than alkaloid 7, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 7- Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org position of the phenanthrene moiety is beneficial for mataining excellent antiviral activity. Alkaloids 4 and 7 displayed about similar activity, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 2position of the phenanthrene moiety is tolerant. The 6-position of the phenanthrene moiety, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , really is a sensitive site: removal of 6-O methyl increased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 16.1; 18.2), which indicated that the 6-position may be a hydrogen donor site; replacement of 6-O methyl with 6-O cyclopropyl methyl significantly decreased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 1.17), which indicated that the steric effect is also a very important factor. Instead of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with methylenedioxyl is tolerant (antiviral activity: 7 < 10 < 11 < 12). However, replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with ethylenedioxyl significantly increased the anti-TMV activity, especially for 6,7-dimethoxyl (antiviral activity: 15.13.14.7). Further to investigated the effect of C 14a chirality on anti-TMV activity, a series of chiral phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 2 ). The (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids exhibited significantly higher activity than their enantiomers (antiviral activity: 2.3; 5.6; 8.9). The structure difference between (R)-cryptopleurine (2) and (R)-antofine lies in the ''E'' ring. (R)-Antofine with a 5-member ''E'' ring displayed inhibition activity of 42.7% inactivation effect, 46.0% curative effect and 45.5% protection effect at 500 mg/mL. However, (R)-cryptopleurine (2) with a 6-member ''E'' ring exhibited significantly higher in vivo antiviral activity than (R)-antofine even at 100 mg/mL. The results further indicated that although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . For (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 2.8); removal of 2-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 5.6). However, the (S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids displayed about similar moderate antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 3 < 6 < 9). In order to investigated the effect of 15-hydroxyl on antiviral activity, a series of 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 19-24 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 3 ). The bioassay results showed that the 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids also displayed good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which alkaloids 19, 20, 22 and 24 exhibited signigicantly higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, and alkaloids 19 and 22 displayed higher in vivo activity than Ningnanmycin at 100 mg/mL. The introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position significantly increased antiviral activity for (S)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 2.19; 5.21; 8.23), but decreased antiviral activity for (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 20.3; 22.6; 24.9). The (S,S)-enantiomers 22 and 24 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity than their corresponding enantiomers 21 and 23. However, the (S,S)-enantiomer 20 showed a lower activity than its enantiomer 19. For (14aS,15S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 20,24); removal of 2-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 22.24). For (14aR,15R)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids, removal of 7-methoxyl or 2methoxyl all increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 19.21.23).

HCl solution (5 mL), ethanol (100 mL) and PtO 2 ?H 2 O (0.1 g) was stirred for 36 h at a pressure of 50 atm under hydrogen. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was treated with aqueous NaOH and extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (36100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 OH (12:1) as eluant to give 42 (0.3 g, 83%) as a white powder. Synthesis of 6-Cyclopropylmethoxy-2,3dimethoxyphenanthro[9,10-b]quinolizidine (17) Compound 17 was synthesized from 42 (3 mmol) by using a similar procedure for the synthesis of alkaloids 10-14, white powder (0.87 g, 80%). The anti-TMV activity of the synthesized pure compounds was tested using our previously reported method [30] . Antiviral activity of compounds against TMV in vitro. Fresh leaf of the 5-6 growth stage of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) inoculated by the juice-leaf rubbing method (concentration of TMV is 5.88 6 10 -2 mg/mL) was cut into halves along the main vein. The halves were immersed into the solution of 500 mg/mL of the compounds and double distilled water for 20 min, respectively, and then cultured at 25uC for 72 h. Each compound was replicated at least three times. Protective effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The compound solution was smeared on the left side and the solvent serving as control on the right side of growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) leaves of the same ages. The leaves were then inoculated with the virus after 12 h. A brush was dipped in TMV of 6 6 10 23 mg/mL to inoculate the leaves, which were previously scattered with silicon carbide. The leaves were then washed with water and rubbed softly along the nervature once or twice. The local lesion numbers appearing 3-4 days after inoculation were counted. There are three replicates for each compound. Inactivation effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The virus was inhibited by mixing with the compound solution at the same volume for 30 min. The mixture was then inoculated on the left side of the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc), whereas the right side of the leaves was inoculated with the mixture of solvent and the virus for control. The local lesion numbers were recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. Curative effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. Growing leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) of the same ages were selected. TMV (concentration of 6.0 6 10 23 mg/mL) was dipped and inoculated on the whole leaves. Then the leaves were washed with water and dried. The compound solution was smeared on the left side, and the solvent was smeared on the right side for control. The local lesion numbers were then counted and recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. The in vitro and in vivo inhibition rates of the compound were then calculated according to the following formula (''av'' means average, and controls were not treated with compound). Inhibition rate (%) = [(av local lesion no. of control 2 av local lesion no. of drug-treated)/av local lesion no. of control] 6 100%. In summary, based on the literature report and our previous work, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were designed, prepared and evaluated for their anti-TMV activity for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo antiviral bioassays showed that most of these alkaloids exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aRconfiguration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased antiviral activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Further studies on mode of action are currently underway in our laboratories.

         "First Discovery and Stucture-Activity Relationship Study of Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Antiviral Agents against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). A series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1–24 were prepared and first evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aR-configuration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus.. Plant viruses cause numerous diseases in a wide range of crop plant species and lead to an estimated $600 billion in annual losses worldwide [1] . Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of Tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world and has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. Most TMVs have infected a number of economically important crops and have induced general mosaic symptoms to cause significant economic losses worldwide [2] . It is found that in certain fields 90-100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. Therefore, this plant virus has the name ''plant cancer'' and is difficult to control. To control viral plant diseases, many approaches have been used, including chemicals, breeding, cross-protection and transgenic plants. However, there are no control measures that can totally inhibit plant viruses after they have infected plants. Ningnanmycin (Figure 1) , perhaps the most successful registered antiplant viral agent, displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 mg/mL. Ribavirin (Figure 1 ) is another widely used plantviral inhibitor, its inhibitory effects are also less than 50% at 500 mg/mL. Because of the unsatisfactory cure rate (30-60%) of common antiviral agents (Ningnanmycin, Ribavirin, Virus A, et al.) and economic loss of tobacco, many efforts have been done to develop novel, potent and structure concise antiviral agents. Some chemicals, such as triazolyl compounds [3] , pyrazole derivatives [4, 5] , cyanoacrylate derivatives [5, 6] , a-aminophosphonate derivatives [5, 7] , N-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-N9-phenylureas [8] , and some natural products [9] [10] [11] , have been found to possess antiviral activity. However, there are only a few reports on economically viable antiviral chemicals available for application in agriculture [12] , so there still lies a great deal of scope for further research in this field. Natural product-based agrochemicals offer advantages in that they can sometimes be specific to a target species and often have unique modes of action with little mammalian toxicity. Another benefit is their ability to decompose rapidly, thereby reducing their risk to the environment [13, 14] . An additional advantage is the natural products can be a candidate that possesses the desirable biological activities. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids are a small group of alkaloids existing in the Lauraceae, Vitaceae and Urticaceae family of plants. Only five of these alkaloids ((R)-cryptopleurine (2), (R)-boehmeriasin A (5), boehmeriasin B (18) , cryptopleuridine and (14aR,15R)-15-hydroxycryptopleurine (19) , Figure 1 ) have been isolated by now [15] [16] [17] [18] . It has been reported that these alkaloids possess unique and interesting biological properties including vesicant [15] , antimicrobial [19] , antiviral [20, 21] and anti-tumor [22] [23] [24] activities. To date, most of the studies have been focused on antitumor activity in medicinal formulation. However, there have been no reports about the anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids in pesticide formulation. In our previous work, the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid (2)antofine ( Figure 1 ) was isolated from the aerial parts of Cynanchum komarovii and was first found to have good antiviral activity against TMV in vitro [25] . Further antiviral mechanism studies revealed that antofine has favorable interaction with origin of TMV RNA (oriRNA), likely exerting its virus inhibition by binding to oriRNA and interfering with virus assembly initiation [26] . Although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . Did the phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids possess anti-TMV activity? Based on the above findings, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were prepared and systematically evaluated for their antiviral activity against TMV. The alkaloids 1-9 [27] , 18 [28] , 19-24 [27] and acids 25a-f [24] were prepared according to the corresponding reported procedures. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10-17 were synthesized by using a practical synthetic approach involving coupling of the phenanthrene ring with 2-bromopyridine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction and subsequent reduction of the resulting pyridyl ketone as key steps. As shown in Figure 2 , 2-bromopyridine was treated with n-BuLi at -78uC to afford 2-lithiopyridine, which reacted smoothly with 25a-f to give pyridyl ketones 26a-f, respectively. By using PtO 2 as the catalyst, the hydrogenation of 26a-e proceeded smoothly in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 50 atm to give 27a-e, respectively. It should be noted that pyridyl ketone 26f could not been reduced under above reduction condition. The reduction of 27a-e in Et 3 SiH/TFA at reflux afforded 28a-e, which were then converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 10-14, respectively, by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation. The hydrogenation of 26f was carried out at several different conditions. The best result is that treatment of compound 26f with PtO 2 in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 4:1) at 50 atm gave the carbonyl group reduced intermediate 29 in 53% yield. Reduction of 29 using the similar procedure for the preparation of 27a-e gave the key intermediate 30 in 92% yield, which was converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 15 by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation ( Figure 3) . In order to further evaluate the effect of 6-hydroxy group on antiviral activity, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 16 and 17 were designed and synthesized. Phenanthrene-9-carboxylic acid 34 was synthesized by employing 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetic acid and 4hydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting materials ( Figure 4) . Ester 33 was obtained by the conventional four steps previously reported in the literature [29] . Then hydrolysis of ester 33 gave acid 34, which was treated with 2-lithiopyridine to afford the desired ketone 35. The catalytic hydrogenation of 35 to give 38 was carried out under two different procedures. Treatment of compound 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst in reluxing methanol at 1 atm gave the alcohol 36 in 83% yield. Reduction of 36 using the Et 3 SiH/TFA system afforded the desired product 37, which was further reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 10 atm gave 38 in 82% yield. For another method, treatment of ketone 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org in reluxing acetic acid at 1 atm gave the key intermediate 38 in 59% yield. Then amino and phenol protection and Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation proceeded sequentially to give 40, which deprotection afforded phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 16 in 69% yield ( Figure 4) . Treatment of pyridine 37 with cyclopropylmethyl bromide obtained 41, which was reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in ethanol and conc. HCl (v/v 20:1) at 50 atm to afford the key intermediate 42. The Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation of 42 gave phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 17 in 80% yield ( Figure 5 ). The phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were first tested for their phytotoxic activity against the test plant, and the results indicated that these natural product-based compounds showed no phytotoxic activity at 500 mg/mL. The commercial plant virucide Ningnanmycin, perhaps the most successful registered anti-plant viral agent, Ribavirin and (R)antofine were used as the controls. In order to investigate the subsituent effects of phenanthrene moiety, a series of racemic phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1, 4, 7, and 10-18 were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activity (Table 1) . To our delight, all the racemic phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids displayed higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, of which cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin, thus emerged as novel potent lead compounds for anti-TMV agents. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. Cryptopleurine (1) exhibited significantly higher activity than alkaloid 7, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 7- Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org position of the phenanthrene moiety is beneficial for mataining excellent antiviral activity. Alkaloids 4 and 7 displayed about similar activity, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 2position of the phenanthrene moiety is tolerant. The 6-position of the phenanthrene moiety, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , really is a sensitive site: removal of 6-O methyl increased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 16.1; 18.2), which indicated that the 6-position may be a hydrogen donor site; replacement of 6-O methyl with 6-O cyclopropyl methyl significantly decreased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 1.17), which indicated that the steric effect is also a very important factor. Instead of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with methylenedioxyl is tolerant (antiviral activity: 7 < 10 < 11 < 12). However, replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with ethylenedioxyl significantly increased the anti-TMV activity, especially for 6,7-dimethoxyl (antiviral activity: 15.13.14.7). Further to investigated the effect of C 14a chirality on anti-TMV activity, a series of chiral phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 2 ). The (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids exhibited significantly higher activity than their enantiomers (antiviral activity: 2.3; 5.6; 8.9). The structure difference between (R)-cryptopleurine (2) and (R)-antofine lies in the ''E'' ring. (R)-Antofine with a 5-member ''E'' ring displayed inhibition activity of 42.7% inactivation effect, 46.0% curative effect and 45.5% protection effect at 500 mg/mL. However, (R)-cryptopleurine (2) with a 6-member ''E'' ring exhibited significantly higher in vivo antiviral activity than (R)-antofine even at 100 mg/mL. The results further indicated that although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . For (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 2.8); removal of 2-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 5.6). However, the (S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids displayed about similar moderate antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 3 < 6 < 9). In order to investigated the effect of 15-hydroxyl on antiviral activity, a series of 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 19-24 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 3 ). The bioassay results showed that the 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids also displayed good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which alkaloids 19, 20, 22 and 24 exhibited signigicantly higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, and alkaloids 19 and 22 displayed higher in vivo activity than Ningnanmycin at 100 mg/mL. The introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position significantly increased antiviral activity for (S)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 2.19; 5.21; 8.23), but decreased antiviral activity for (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 20.3; 22.6; 24.9). The (S,S)-enantiomers 22 and 24 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity than their corresponding enantiomers 21 and 23. However, the (S,S)-enantiomer 20 showed a lower activity than its enantiomer 19. For (14aS,15S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 20,24); removal of 2-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 22.24). For (14aR,15R)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids, removal of 7-methoxyl or 2methoxyl all increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 19.21.23). Reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were used as received. All anhydrous solvent were dried and purified by standard techniques just before use.

The mixture was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford alkaloid 16 (0.02 g, 69%) as a light pink powder. A mixture of pyridine 37 (2.8 mmol) and Cs 2 CO 3 (3.7 mmol) in DMF (20 mL) was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. To the result solution was added cyclopropylmethyl bromide (3.3 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 10 h at room temperature, and quenched with H 2 O (100 mL), then extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3650 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with H 2 O (6650 mL) and brine (3650 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with CH 2 Cl 2 /EtOAc (6:1) as eluant to afford 41 (1.0 g, 83%) as a white powder. Synthesis of 2-[(3-Cyclopropylmethoxy-6,7dimethoxyphenanthren-9-yl)methyl]piperidine (42) A mixture of 41 (1 mmol), conc. HCl solution (5 mL), ethanol (100 mL) and PtO 2 ?H 2 O (0.1 g) was stirred for 36 h at a pressure of 50 atm under hydrogen. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was treated with aqueous NaOH and extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (36100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 OH (12:1) as eluant to give 42 (0.3 g, 83%) as a white powder. Synthesis of 6-Cyclopropylmethoxy-2,3dimethoxyphenanthro[9,10-b]quinolizidine (17) Compound 17 was synthesized from 42 (3 mmol) by using a similar procedure for the synthesis of alkaloids 10-14, white powder (0.87 g, 80%). The anti-TMV activity of the synthesized pure compounds was tested using our previously reported method [30] . Antiviral activity of compounds against TMV in vitro. Fresh leaf of the 5-6 growth stage of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) inoculated by the juice-leaf rubbing method (concentration of TMV is 5.88 6 10 -2 mg/mL) was cut into halves along the main vein. The halves were immersed into the solution of 500 mg/mL of the compounds and double distilled water for 20 min, respectively, and then cultured at 25uC for 72 h. Each compound was replicated at least three times. Protective effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The compound solution was smeared on the left side and the solvent serving as control on the right side of growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) leaves of the same ages. The leaves were then inoculated with the virus after 12 h. A brush was dipped in TMV of 6 6 10 23 mg/mL to inoculate the leaves, which were previously scattered with silicon carbide. The leaves were then washed with water and rubbed softly along the nervature once or twice. The local lesion numbers appearing 3-4 days after inoculation were counted. There are three replicates for each compound. Inactivation effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The virus was inhibited by mixing with the compound solution at the same volume for 30 min. The mixture was then inoculated on the left side of the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc), whereas the right side of the leaves was inoculated with the mixture of solvent and the virus for control. The local lesion numbers were recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. Curative effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. Growing leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) of the same ages were selected. TMV (concentration of 6.0 6 10 23 mg/mL) was dipped and inoculated on the whole leaves. Then the leaves were washed with water and dried. The compound solution was smeared on the left side, and the solvent was smeared on the right side for control. The local lesion numbers were then counted and recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. The in vitro and in vivo inhibition rates of the compound were then calculated according to the following formula (''av'' means average, and controls were not treated with compound). Inhibition rate (%) = [(av local lesion no. of control 2 av local lesion no. of drug-treated)/av local lesion no. of control] 6 100%. In summary, based on the literature report and our previous work, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were designed, prepared and evaluated for their anti-TMV activity for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo antiviral bioassays showed that most of these alkaloids exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aRconfiguration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased antiviral activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Further studies on mode of action are currently underway in our laboratories.

         "Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≤100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of >1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression. Conclusions. Host and transplant related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.",

         "Infection caused by respiratory viruses is a threat for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause serious progressive disease in both allogeneic and autologous transplant recipients [1] [2] [3] with mortality as high as 20%-40% with current treatment interventions [4] . Although treatment options such as antiviral agents, steroids, and immunoglobulin are frequently used, there is no definitive treatment for RSV disease in the transplant population [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . RSV infection in HCT recipients can present as a self-limited upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or can progress to more severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRD), a condition associated with a high mortality or late airflow obstruction among survivors [11] . Because RSV LRD is a potentially life-threatening disease, identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe LRD is important. Lymphopenia has been identified as important risk factor for progression in several studies [1, 12, 13] , but the significance of other factors that could plausibly be associated with disease progression, including lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, viral subtypes, neutralizing antibody titers, lung function, and smoking history has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively determine the significance of host, viral, and treatment factors for the progression to RSV LRD in patients who presented with RSV URI. Patients who underwent allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous HCT at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Seattle Cancer Center Alliance in Seattle, Washington, from November 1988 to June 2011 were analyzed. Patients with respiratory symptoms had respiratory secretions analyzed for respiratory viruses according to institutional protocols and received standardized care for RSV disease [14] . Patients with RSV URI received high dose intermittently (6 g/day, 60 mg/mL for 2 hours every 8 hours) or low dose continuously (6 g/day, 20 mg/mL for 18 hours/day) ribavirin at the discretion of the attending physician, with or without immunoglobulin or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fusion protein of RSV, palivizumab. Use of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and palivizumab at the time of RSV infection was also analyzed. Steroids were given to patients with acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and IVIG was given mainly for GVHD prophylaxis and low immunoglobulin levels (maximum 500 mg/kg/week). After January 1993, routine IVIG administration was discontinued. Only patients who signed a consent allowing retrospective research (>95%) were included in the study, and the study was approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. Patients who developed respiratory tract illness due to confirmed RSV infection were considered to have RSV infection. Only patients who presented with RSV URI within 100 days post HCT were included for the analysis. RSV URI was defined as respiratory infection confined to the nose, throat, and sinuses as confirmed by detection of RSV without any evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. RSV LRD was defined as detection of RSV in the lower respiratory tract by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy in patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough, oxygen requirement, wheezing) or radiographic new infiltrates. Patients who had URI only were defined as nonprogressors and patients who had URI initially that subsequently progressed to LRD were defined as progressors. Patients who presented with RSV LRD concurrently with URI (defined as development of LRD within 2 days of RSV URI) were excluded. Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal wash/swab and BAL samples) were studied for viral antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining for RSV, influenza A, B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and adenovirus, human metapnuemovirus (since April 2007); conventional and shell vial centrifugation viral cultures were performed as a standard practice for all patients throughout the study period [6, 11] . After 2006, upper respiratory tract samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of conventional methods, whereas BAL samples were tested both by conventional methods and PCR [15] . Cultured RSV isolates were stored at −70°C. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the samples and tested for RSV RNA by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay as described elsewhere [16] . The RSV type specific assay contained one primer set to amplify a 94 bp region of the RSV polymerase gene from both types A and B, a 5′ 6FAMlabeled probe specific for RSV type A, and a 5′ VIC-labeled probe specific for RSV type B. Both probes were labeled on the 3′ end with MGBNFQ. We tested available sera from a prospectively collected serum repository (mostly collected from 1990s). Pretransplant sera from both donors and HCT recipients and weekly posttransplant sera close to URI event (within 2 weeks before and 1 week after) were analyzed. The sampled sera were stored at or below −20°C. Measurement of serum neutralizing-antibody titers to RSV was performed using an established microneutralization method for RSV A (MNA) and RSV B (MNB) strains in the laboratory of Dr Walsh at the University of Rochester [17, 18] . In brief, serum dilutions were incubated with 75 plaqueforming units (PFU) of RSV A2 strain (group A virus) or RSV B1 strain (group B virus) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1.5 × 10 4 HEp-2 cells in 96-well culture plates. After 3 days, the quantity of RSV antigen was determined by EIA using monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RSV F protein. The neutralization titer was defined as the serum dilution that results in a 50% reduction in color development. The probability of progression from upper to lower RSV infection was estimated using cumulative incidence. Death was treated as a competing risk for progression. Differences in the proportions of patients who progressed to LRD were evaluated for statistical significance with logistic regression models. The following variables were considered potential predictors of progression: patient age, sex, smoking status, donor type, cell source, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, year transplant performed, total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning, presence of acute GVHD, lymphocyte count at the time of RSV URI onset, pretransplant lung function, RSV subtype, time from transplant to RSV infection, ribavirin treatment, steroid treatment at varying doses, RSV antibody levels and weekly IVIG infusion. Grades 2-4 acute GVHD was considered present if it was diagnosed before or up to 2 days after the diagnosis of upper RSV infection. Patients who received an autologous or syngeneic transplant were categorized separately for analysis of acute GVHD as a risk factor for progression. The antibody levels were classified according to RSV subtype. All covariates with at least 90% complete data were candidates for the primary analysis via multiple logistic regression models. A variable was retained in the multivariable model if its univariate association with progression resulted in a P value ≤ .1. Ribavirin treatment was retained in all models because it was a predictor of interest. Covariates missing for more than 10% of the data were not included in the first round of multivariable modeling, but were subsequently examined in subsets of patients with available data. The statistical significance of differences in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) between the times of URI onset and LRD onset for progressors, and the times of URI onset and 7 days later for nonprogressors, was evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. These differences in ALC values and the slopes (change in ALC/days between URI and LRD or 7) were then compared by progression status via t-test. Reported P values are 2-sided and based on the Wald statistic. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). One hundred eighty-one patients including 147 allogeneic and 34 autologous HCT recipients were evaluated (Table 1) . Two patients received syngeneic transplants, and 7 patients were treated with tandem transplants (autologous HCT prior to allogeneic HCT, classified as allogeneic for analysis). The median age was 40.0 years (range, 0.3-72.8 years). The age distribution is as follows: 6 patients were younger than 2 years of age, 20 were 2-14 years, 15 were 15-24 years, 89 were 25-49 years, and 51 were 50 year old or older. One hundred fifty-three patients were white (85%). Eighty one recipients (45%) were CMV negative, and 82 donors (45%) were CMV negative. Among the 181 patients studied, 138 patients (76%) had URI only (nonprogressors) and 43 patients (24%) had URI initially and then progressed to LRD ( progressors). RSV URI occurred at median post-transplant day 49 (range 1-100). The cumulative incidence of progression at day 40 post-URI diagnosis was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-30%, Figure 1A ). Progression to LRD occurred in 36 allogeneic HCT recipients (24%) and in 7 autologous recipients (21%). Progression to LRD occurred at a median of 7 days after RSV URI onset (range, 2-38 days). There were no progression in the 6 patients who were <2 years old. RSV isolates from 76 patients were available for additional virus culture and subtyping by RT-PCR (49 with stable URI and 27 with progression to LRD; Table 1 ). For RSV subtype specific antibodies measurement, sera from 36 donors and 40 recipients pretransplant were available. Sera taken near the time of onset of RSV URI from 38 recipients posttransplant were also tested (25 with stable URI and 13 with progression to LRD). In a univariate model (Table 1) , smoking status, transplant year, high TBI dose, conditioning regimen, lymphocyte count at URI onset, and time of URI onset were sufficiently predictive of progression to LRD to qualify for the multivariable model. In a multivariable model ( Table 2 , left side), including 175 patients with 41 progressors, positive smoking status, TBI of 1200 cGy or more, and a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset were significant risk factors for progression to LRD. Of note, treatment with high-dose ribavirin did not reach statistical significance when included in the model. To determine if risk factors were different when considering only LRD events confirmed by radiographic infiltrates, an additional model was fit (Table 2 , right side). In that subgroup of 31 patients who progressed to radiographically proven LRD, only a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset remained a significant risk factor for progression to LRD. The probability of progression to LRD from RSV URI by lymphocyte counts at URI onset is shown in Figure 1B . To determine whether the high-dose ribavirin treatment effect varied based on baseline lymphocyte count we performed a stratified analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B) . There appeared to be stronger trend towards a treatment effect in the low lymphocyte strata (total lymphocyte count <300/mm 3 ), but neither result reached statistical significance. We also fit multivariable models to examine the effect of corticosteroid dose at the time of URI diagnosis. When we adjusted for lymphocyte count, smoking status, high-dose ribavirin and TBI, steroid dose was not associated with progression to LRD (data not shown). Because the stored RSV culture isolates were further subtyped by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 76 patients, we could identify each RSV infection episode by RSV subtypes (36 patients with subtype A and 40 patients with subtype B; Table 1 ). RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progression in univariate analysis (Table 1) . RSV subtypespecific neutralizing antibody (RSV A vs RSV B) levels were examined in donors and in recipients, pretransplant, and posttransplant close to the time of RSV URI, and none of these showed a statistically significant association with progression (Table 3) . Similarly, weekly IVIG infusion did not impact risk of progression (Table 1) . The effect of immune reconstitution on progression was examined in 43 progressors and 138 nonprogressors by comparing changes in ALC over time. In progressors, ALC at URI onset and LRD onset were compared. Because the median time for progression from URI to LRD was 7 days, the ALC at the time of URI onset and 7 days later were compared in nonprogressors. In the progressors, the median ALC at URI and LRD onset were 140/mm 3 and 198/mm 3 , respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A ). In nonprogressors, the median ALC at URI onset and URI 7 days were 400/mm 3 and 453/mm 3 (Supplementary Figure 2B ). The median (range) change in ALCs in progressors vs nonprogressors were −6/mm 3 (−410 to 780/mm 3 ) and 29/mm 3 (−3854 to 2070/mm 3 ), respectively (Figure 2A) . ALC changes as a rate per day were also examined by calculating the slopes of ALC changes as (ALC at LRD onset-ALC at URI onset) divided by days between URI and LRD in progressors, and (ALC at URI d7-ALC at URI onset) divided by 7 in nonprogressors. The median (range) slopes in progressors vs nonprogressors were −2/mm 3 day −1 (−48 to 220/mm 3 day −1 ) vs 4/mm 3 day −1 (−551 to 296/mm 3 day −1 ) ( Figure 2B ). There were no significant differences between the groups in change in ALC (P = .52) or slope of ALC (P = .96). [19] . RSV disease progression is not universal, with observed rates of progression ranging from 0% up to 60% (mean 38%) [10, 20, 21] . The identification of risk factors associated with progression and assessment of potential treatment modalities are important when caring for these patients. This study was designed to determine the significance of viral subtype, type-specific neutralizing antibodies and other previously untested factors that could be associated with progression to lower respiratory tract disease. We found that smoking, conditioning with high-dose TBI, and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with progression (Table 2) , whereas the viral subtype, RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies, lung function, and lymphocyte engraftment dynamics appeared similar between progressors and nonprogressors (Table 1 and 3 and Figure 2A and 2B). To date, lymphopenia is the only established risk factor for progression of RSV URI to LRD in HCT recipients. We validated this association in statistical models that adjusted for other important risk factors and defined, for the first time to our knowledge, a protective level of the ALC. In our study, we determined that lymphocyte counts >1000/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were associated with complete protection from disease progression. Although absolute levels of lymphocytes appeared to be extremely predictive for subsequent LRD, lymphocyte engraftment dynamics had no apparent effect. A potential role of lymphocytes in immune reconstitution has been suspected as risk factor for RSV LRD development because severe RSV disease is known to occur more frequently if infection occurs before engraftment [22] . Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known phenomenon observed as clinical deterioration in the setting of infection in the face of immune restoration by antiretroviral therapy in certain individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23] [24] [25] . IRIS has also been reported in non-HIV settings such as HCT, solid organ transplant recipients, autoimmune diseases, or cancer therapy with multiple pathogens [26, 27] . The existence of the immune reconstitution phenomenon in the context of RSV disease progression in HCT recipients has not been systematically analyzed. Because lymphocyte counts were found to be the critical risk factor for progression, we examined the effect of lymphocyte count changes on progression from URI to LRD to test whether progression to LRD was associated with increasing lymphocyte counts and thus a form of IRIS. The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28] . However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B) , suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD. RSV-specific antibodies play an important role in the prevention of RSV disease in young children [29, 30] . Palivizumab prophylaxis has been documented to prevent serious RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [31] but has shown only very limited success in treatment situations [6, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log 2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36] . A recent retrospective pooled review on management of RSV infections in adult recipients of HCT showed that treatment interventions (such as aerosolized ribavirin alone or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin, RSV specific immunoglobulin, or palivizumab) reduced the progression by almost one-third compared to no treatment [20] . Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URI did not show a beneficial effect [8, 10] . Overall, the importance of serum RSV-Ab level in protecting the HCT patient from RSV disease progression is not known, and there is presently no good evidence supporting its use in patients with RSV URI [37] . Based on the above data, we hypothesized that differences in RSV antibody level would influence the progression outcome during RSV infection. The effect of preexisting RSV antibody level in donors and recipients before HCT and posttransplant period near the time when RSV infection occurred was examined. Our analyses did not show any role of preexisting antibody levels in the progression of RSV disease from upper to lower tract infection (Table 3) . Although we did not observe differences in antibody levels between progressors and nonprogressors, this study is the first to our knowledge to measure the RSV A and B subtype specific antibody level in HCT recipients and their donors. Optimal RSV-specific antibody levels in HCT recipients or donors for the prevention of progression in HCT recipients are not known, but these data will provide reference for future studies. Differences in RSV disease severity based on subtypes A and B have been suggested in children with primary infection in the literature [38] . RSV A and B typically cocirculate in the community, and both types are also detected in immunocompromised populations [16, 39, 40] . We correlated RSV subtypes with disease progression in our subjects, demonstrating that RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progressive disease (Table 1 ). Although we were only able to perform this analysis in a relatively small subset of patients, we were unable to detect any trends. Therefore, if an effect of subtype on disease progression is present, it is likely to be small. Active smoking before HCT was a risk factor for progression in this study. This is a novel observation for the immunocompromised patient population and a potentially modifiable factor. Household smoke has long been identified as a risk for RSV bronchiolitis in the pediatric population [41, 42] but has not been studied systematically in immunocompromised adult populations. We also examined the role of steroid treatment at varying doses, presence of varying degrees of GVHD, time from transplantation to RSV infection, and other transplant and host factors but found no statistically significant associations. The lack of association with steroid dose is important in clinical practice. Physicians often wonder whether small doses of steroids can be given to ease obstructive patterns or if a rapid taper should be initiated if patients are already receiving steroids (mostly for GVHD). Although this was not a randomized trial, our data would suggest that moderate doses of systemic corticosteroids may not be associated with progression to LRD. This study did not find a statistically significant effect of high-dose ribavirin when given for RSV URI. However, the number of patients treated was relatively small, and the trend was consistent with other reports in the literature [43] [44] [45] . Preemptive aerosolized ribavirin has not been evaluated in adequately powered randomized controlled trials in immunocompromised patients, although recent analyses suggested a beneficial effect [2, 20] . In addition, there are a few case series studies reporting the effect of oral or intravenous ribavirin treatment, which needs further evaluation [46, 47] Our study has several strengths and limitations. Although we included clinical data from a large number of patients who initially presented with RSV URI, sera for RSV specific antibody test were available only in a subset of recipients and donors (less than half), and RSV virus subtype was also only available in 76 patients. Therefore, smaller effect sizes associated with RSV subtypes or RSV-specific antibody levels may have been missed. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine RSV subtype-specific antibody levels in HCT recipients with concurrent virus subtyping. In addition, this study examined the effect of immune reconstitution, although only by analyzing overall lymphocyte engraftment dynamics. We were unable to evaluate the effects of specific T-cell subsets because these data were not available, and there were no cells available for study. In conclusion, among 181 HCT recipients who presented with RSV URI, we identified smoking, conditioning with highdose TBI (1200-1575 cGy), and ALC of ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset as significant risk factors associated with progression. We also observed that ALC of >1000/mm 3 was completely protective against RSV disease progression. The importance of lymphocyte counts and the lack C of importance of antibody levels suggest that a characterization of RSV-specific cellmediated immunity is warranted.

Lymphopenia has been identified as important risk factor for progression in several studies [1, 12, 13] , but the significance of other factors that could plausibly be associated with disease progression, including lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, viral subtypes, neutralizing antibody titers, lung function, and smoking history has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively determine the significance of host, viral, and treatment factors for the progression to RSV LRD in patients who presented with RSV URI. Patients who underwent allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous HCT at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Seattle Cancer Center Alliance in Seattle, Washington, from November 1988 to June 2011 were analyzed. Patients with respiratory symptoms had respiratory secretions analyzed for respiratory viruses according to institutional protocols and received standardized care for RSV disease [14] . Patients with RSV URI received high dose intermittently (6 g/day, 60 mg/mL for 2 hours every 8 hours) or low dose continuously (6 g/day, 20 mg/mL for 18 hours/day) ribavirin at the discretion of the attending physician, with or without immunoglobulin or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fusion protein of RSV, palivizumab. Use of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and palivizumab at the time of RSV infection was also analyzed. Steroids were given to patients with acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and IVIG was given mainly for GVHD prophylaxis and low immunoglobulin levels (maximum 500 mg/kg/week). After January 1993, routine IVIG administration was discontinued. Only patients who signed a consent allowing retrospective research (>95%) were included in the study, and the study was approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. Patients who developed respiratory tract illness due to confirmed RSV infection were considered to have RSV infection. Only patients who presented with RSV URI within 100 days post HCT were included for the analysis. RSV URI was defined as respiratory infection confined to the nose, throat, and sinuses as confirmed by detection of RSV without any evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. RSV LRD was defined as detection of RSV in the lower respiratory tract by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy in patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough, oxygen requirement, wheezing) or radiographic new infiltrates. Patients who had URI only were defined as nonprogressors and patients who had URI initially that subsequently progressed to LRD were defined as progressors. Patients who presented with RSV LRD concurrently with URI (defined as development of LRD within 2 days of RSV URI) were excluded. Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal wash/swab and BAL samples) were studied for viral antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining for RSV, influenza A, B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and adenovirus, human metapnuemovirus (since April 2007); conventional and shell vial centrifugation viral cultures were performed as a standard practice for all patients throughout the study period [6, 11] . After 2006, upper respiratory tract samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of conventional methods, whereas BAL samples were tested both by conventional methods and PCR [15] . Cultured RSV isolates were stored at −70°C. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the samples and tested for RSV RNA by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay as described elsewhere [16] . The RSV type specific assay contained one primer set to amplify a 94 bp region of the RSV polymerase gene from both types A and B, a 5′ 6FAMlabeled probe specific for RSV type A, and a 5′ VIC-labeled probe specific for RSV type B. Both probes were labeled on the 3′ end with MGBNFQ. We tested available sera from a prospectively collected serum repository (mostly collected from 1990s). Pretransplant sera from both donors and HCT recipients and weekly posttransplant sera close to URI event (within 2 weeks before and 1 week after) were analyzed. The sampled sera were stored at or below −20°C. Measurement of serum neutralizing-antibody titers to RSV was performed using an established microneutralization method for RSV A (MNA) and RSV B (MNB) strains in the laboratory of Dr Walsh at the University of Rochester [17, 18] . In brief, serum dilutions were incubated with 75 plaqueforming units (PFU) of RSV A2 strain (group A virus) or RSV B1 strain (group B virus) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1.5 × 10 4 HEp-2 cells in 96-well culture plates. After 3 days, the quantity of RSV antigen was determined by EIA using monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RSV F protein. The neutralization titer was defined as the serum dilution that results in a 50% reduction in color development. The probability of progression from upper to lower RSV infection was estimated using cumulative incidence. Death was treated as a competing risk for progression. Differences in the proportions of patients who progressed to LRD were evaluated for statistical significance with logistic regression models. The following variables were considered potential predictors of progression: patient age, sex, smoking status, donor type, cell source, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, year transplant performed, total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning, presence of acute GVHD, lymphocyte count at the time of RSV URI onset, pretransplant lung function, RSV subtype, time from transplant to RSV infection, ribavirin treatment, steroid treatment at varying doses, RSV antibody levels and weekly IVIG infusion. Grades 2-4 acute GVHD was considered present if it was diagnosed before or up to 2 days after the diagnosis of upper RSV infection. Patients who received an autologous or syngeneic transplant were categorized separately for analysis of acute GVHD as a risk factor for progression. The antibody levels were classified according to RSV subtype. All covariates with at least 90% complete data were candidates for the primary analysis via multiple logistic regression models. A variable was retained in the multivariable model if its univariate association with progression resulted in a P value ≤ .1. Ribavirin treatment was retained in all models because it was a predictor of interest. Covariates missing for more than 10% of the data were not included in the first round of multivariable modeling, but were subsequently examined in subsets of patients with available data. The statistical significance of differences in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) between the times of URI onset and LRD onset for progressors, and the times of URI onset and 7 days later for nonprogressors, was evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. These differences in ALC values and the slopes (change in ALC/days between URI and LRD or 7) were then compared by progression status via t-test. Reported P values are 2-sided and based on the Wald statistic. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). One hundred eighty-one patients including 147 allogeneic and 34 autologous HCT recipients were evaluated (Table 1) . Two patients received syngeneic transplants, and 7 patients were treated with tandem transplants (autologous HCT prior to allogeneic HCT, classified as allogeneic for analysis). The median age was 40.0 years (range, 0.3-72.8 years). The age distribution is as follows: 6 patients were younger than 2 years of age, 20 were 2-14 years, 15 were 15-24 years, 89 were 25-49 years, and 51 were 50 year old or older. One hundred fifty-three patients were white (85%). Eighty one recipients (45%) were CMV negative, and 82 donors (45%) were CMV negative. Among the 181 patients studied, 138 patients (76%) had URI only (nonprogressors) and 43 patients (24%) had URI initially and then progressed to LRD ( progressors). RSV URI occurred at median post-transplant day 49 (range 1-100). The cumulative incidence of progression at day 40 post-URI diagnosis was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-30%, Figure 1A ). Progression to LRD occurred in 36 allogeneic HCT recipients (24%) and in 7 autologous recipients (21%). Progression to LRD occurred at a median of 7 days after RSV URI onset (range, 2-38 days). There were no progression in the 6 patients who were <2 years old. RSV isolates from 76 patients were available for additional virus culture and subtyping by RT-PCR (49 with stable URI and 27 with progression to LRD; Table 1 ). For RSV subtype specific antibodies measurement, sera from 36 donors and 40 recipients pretransplant were available. Sera taken near the time of onset of RSV URI from 38 recipients posttransplant were also tested (25 with stable URI and 13 with progression to LRD). In a univariate model (Table 1) , smoking status, transplant year, high TBI dose, conditioning regimen, lymphocyte count at URI onset, and time of URI onset were sufficiently predictive of progression to LRD to qualify for the multivariable model. In a multivariable model ( Table 2 , left side), including 175 patients with 41 progressors, positive smoking status, TBI of 1200 cGy or more, and a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset were significant risk factors for progression to LRD. Of note, treatment with high-dose ribavirin did not reach statistical significance when included in the model. To determine if risk factors were different when considering only LRD events confirmed by radiographic infiltrates, an additional model was fit (Table 2 , right side). In that subgroup of 31 patients who progressed to radiographically proven LRD, only a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset remained a significant risk factor for progression to LRD. The probability of progression to LRD from RSV URI by lymphocyte counts at URI onset is shown in Figure 1B . To determine whether the high-dose ribavirin treatment effect varied based on baseline lymphocyte count we performed a stratified analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B) . There appeared to be stronger trend towards a treatment effect in the low lymphocyte strata (total lymphocyte count <300/mm 3 ), but neither result reached statistical significance. We also fit multivariable models to examine the effect of corticosteroid dose at the time of URI diagnosis. When we adjusted for lymphocyte count, smoking status, high-dose ribavirin and TBI, steroid dose was not associated with progression to LRD (data not shown). Because the stored RSV culture isolates were further subtyped by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 76 patients, we could identify each RSV infection episode by RSV subtypes (36 patients with subtype A and 40 patients with subtype B; Table 1 ). RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progression in univariate analysis (Table 1) . RSV subtypespecific neutralizing antibody (RSV A vs RSV B) levels were examined in donors and in recipients, pretransplant, and posttransplant close to the time of RSV URI, and none of these showed a statistically significant association with progression (Table 3) . Similarly, weekly IVIG infusion did not impact risk of progression (Table 1) . The effect of immune reconstitution on progression was examined in 43 progressors and 138 nonprogressors by comparing changes in ALC over time. In progressors, ALC at URI onset and LRD onset were compared. Because the median time for progression from URI to LRD was 7 days, the ALC at the time of URI onset and 7 days later were compared in nonprogressors. In the progressors, the median ALC at URI and LRD onset were 140/mm 3 and 198/mm 3 , respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A ). In nonprogressors, the median ALC at URI onset and URI 7 days were 400/mm 3 and 453/mm 3 (Supplementary Figure 2B ). The median (range) change in ALCs in progressors vs nonprogressors were −6/mm 3 (−410 to 780/mm 3 ) and 29/mm 3 (−3854 to 2070/mm 3 ), respectively (Figure 2A) . ALC changes as a rate per day were also examined by calculating the slopes of ALC changes as (ALC at LRD onset-ALC at URI onset) divided by days between URI and LRD in progressors, and (ALC at URI d7-ALC at URI onset) divided by 7 in nonprogressors. The median (range) slopes in progressors vs nonprogressors were −2/mm 3 day −1 (−48 to 220/mm 3 day −1 ) vs 4/mm 3 day −1 (−551 to 296/mm 3 day −1 ) ( Figure 2B ). There were no significant differences between the groups in change in ALC (P = .52) or slope of ALC (P = .96). [19] . RSV disease progression is not universal, with observed rates of progression ranging from 0% up to 60% (mean 38%) [10, 20, 21] . The identification of risk factors associated with progression and assessment of potential treatment modalities are important when caring for these patients. This study was designed to determine the significance of viral subtype, type-specific neutralizing antibodies and other previously untested factors that could be associated with progression to lower respiratory tract disease. We found that smoking, conditioning with high-dose TBI, and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with progression (Table 2) , whereas the viral subtype, RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies, lung function, and lymphocyte engraftment dynamics appeared similar between progressors and nonprogressors (Table 1 and 3 and Figure 2A and 2B). To date, lymphopenia is the only established risk factor for progression of RSV URI to LRD in HCT recipients. We validated this association in statistical models that adjusted for other important risk factors and defined, for the first time to our knowledge, a protective level of the ALC. In our study, we determined that lymphocyte counts >1000/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were associated with complete protection from disease progression. Although absolute levels of lymphocytes appeared to be extremely predictive for subsequent LRD, lymphocyte engraftment dynamics had no apparent effect. A potential role of lymphocytes in immune reconstitution has been suspected as risk factor for RSV LRD development because severe RSV disease is known to occur more frequently if infection occurs before engraftment [22] . Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known phenomenon observed as clinical deterioration in the setting of infection in the face of immune restoration by antiretroviral therapy in certain individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23] [24] [25] . IRIS has also been reported in non-HIV settings such as HCT, solid organ transplant recipients, autoimmune diseases, or cancer therapy with multiple pathogens [26, 27] . The existence of the immune reconstitution phenomenon in the context of RSV disease progression in HCT recipients has not been systematically analyzed. Because lymphocyte counts were found to be the critical risk factor for progression, we examined the effect of lymphocyte count changes on progression from URI to LRD to test whether progression to LRD was associated with increasing lymphocyte counts and thus a form of IRIS. The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28] . However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B) , suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD. RSV-specific antibodies play an important role in the prevention of RSV disease in young children [29, 30] . Palivizumab prophylaxis has been documented to prevent serious RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [31] but has shown only very limited success in treatment situations [6, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log 2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36] . A recent retrospective pooled review on management of RSV infections in adult recipients of HCT showed that treatment interventions (such as aerosolized ribavirin alone or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin, RSV specific immunoglobulin, or palivizumab) reduced the progression by almost one-third compared to no treatment [20] . Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URI did not show a beneficial effect [8, 10] . Overall, the importance of serum RSV-Ab level in protecting the HCT patient from RSV disease progression is not known, and there is presently no good evidence supporting its use in patients with RSV URI [37] . Based on the above data, we hypothesized that differences in RSV antibody level would influence the progression outcome during RSV infection. The effect of preexisting RSV antibody level in donors and recipients before HCT and posttransplant period near the time when RSV infection occurred was examined. Our analyses did not show any role of preexisting antibody levels in the progression of RSV disease from upper to lower tract infection (Table 3) . Although we did not observe differences in antibody levels between progressors and nonprogressors, this study is the first to our knowledge to measure the RSV A and B subtype specific antibody level in HCT recipients and their donors. Optimal RSV-specific antibody levels in HCT recipients or donors for the prevention of progression in HCT recipients are not known, but these data will provide reference for future studies. Differences in RSV disease severity based on subtypes A and B have been suggested in children with primary infection in the literature [38] . RSV A and B typically cocirculate in the community, and both types are also detected in immunocompromised populations [16, 39, 40] . We correlated RSV subtypes with disease progression in our subjects, demonstrating that RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progressive disease (Table 1 ). Although we were only able to perform this analysis in a relatively small subset of patients, we were unable to detect any trends. Therefore, if an effect of subtype on disease progression is present, it is likely to be small. Active smoking before HCT was a risk factor for progression in this study. This is a novel observation for the immunocompromised patient population and a potentially modifiable factor. Household smoke has long been identified as a risk for RSV bronchiolitis in the pediatric population [41, 42] but has not been studied systematically in immunocompromised adult populations. We also examined the role of steroid treatment at varying doses, presence of varying degrees of GVHD, time from transplantation to RSV infection, and other transplant and host factors but found no statistically significant associations. The lack of association with steroid dose is important in clinical practice. Physicians often wonder whether small doses of steroids can be given to ease obstructive patterns or if a rapid taper should be initiated if patients are already receiving steroids (mostly for GVHD). Although this was not a randomized trial, our data would suggest that moderate doses of systemic corticosteroids may not be associated with progression to LRD. This study did not find a statistically significant effect of high-dose ribavirin when given for RSV URI. However, the number of patients treated was relatively small, and the trend was consistent with other reports in the literature [43] [44] [45] . Preemptive aerosolized ribavirin has not been evaluated in adequately powered randomized controlled trials in immunocompromised patients, although recent analyses suggested a beneficial effect [2, 20] . In addition, there are a few case series studies reporting the effect of oral or intravenous ribavirin treatment, which needs further evaluation [46, 47] Our study has several strengths and limitations. Although we included clinical data from a large number of patients who initially presented with RSV URI, sera for RSV specific antibody test were available only in a subset of recipients and donors (less than half), and RSV virus subtype was also only available in 76 patients. Therefore, smaller effect sizes associated with RSV subtypes or RSV-specific antibody levels may have been missed. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine RSV subtype-specific antibody levels in HCT recipients with concurrent virus subtyping. In addition, this study examined the effect of immune reconstitution, although only by analyzing overall lymphocyte engraftment dynamics. We were unable to evaluate the effects of specific T-cell subsets because these data were not available, and there were no cells available for study. In conclusion, among 181 HCT recipients who presented with RSV URI, we identified smoking, conditioning with highdose TBI (1200-1575 cGy), and ALC of ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset as significant risk factors associated with progression. We also observed that ALC of >1000/mm 3 was completely protective against RSV disease progression. The importance of lymphocyte counts and the lack C of importance of antibody levels suggest that a characterization of RSV-specific cellmediated immunity is warranted.

         "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma. Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum. It was not found in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. CONCLUSION: HMPV is only found in a very small number of patients with AE-COPD. However it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of AE-COPD because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely.",

         "Respiratory viruses play an important role in exacerbations of COPD and this has been increasingly recognised since the application of molecular detection methods [1, 2] . The most prevalent viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction so far were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza 3. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus first isolated from a dutch child with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [3] . World wide distribution is probable since it has been isolated in North HMPV has been recognized as a member of the Paramyxoviridae like RSV and it is not only associated with bronchiolitis in most cases, but also with pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma [14, 15] , diseases which share some features with COPD. Up to date reports about hMPV in adults are scarce. In a general Canadian population 14.8% of patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections were hMPV positive. Thirty-three percent of hMPV-infected patients were hospitalized and the hospitalization rates were significantly higher among patients below 5 years and those over 50 years of age [16] . In another prospective cohort of adults, hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses but also in 4.1% of asymptomatic subjects. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly [17] . HMPV infection can be severe since the virus was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . The role of hMPV in acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) has been studied recently in outpatients and only low frequencies have been observed [17, 19] . Up to now the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized with AE-COPD is unknown. Our aim was therefore to investigate the frequency of detection of hMPV in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to compare these results to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without COPD. Three different groups were studied. The first group consisted of hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD), the second group were subjects with stable COPD and the third group was composed of smokers without COPD. The groups were defined as previously published [20] . Briefly AE-COPD patients suffered from COPD as defined by GOLD [21] . Acute exacerbation was characterized by worsening in dyspnea, cough, and expectoration. A routine posterior-anterior chest radiograph was evaluated on admission by expert radiologists to exclude other other reasons for increased symptoms as pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchial carcinoma or congestive heart failure.Stable COPD patients did not have an exacerbation within the last 30 days prior to hospital admission and had no changes in therapy within the last 14 days (including inhaled and oral medication) and had been admitted for other medical reasons into departments of internal medicine other than pulmonary care. COPD subjects were recruited in a 2:1 ratio each month in order to prevent seasonal selection bias. Smokers have been smoking more than 10 pack-years, could have chronic symptoms like cough and phlegm but did not report dyspnea and did not have bronchial obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC>70%, FEV 1 >80% predicted). None of the smokers had a history of COPD or asthma, nor was using systemic or topic pulmonary medication. The smokers were recruited either from our smoking cessation initiative or by newspaper advertisement. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Ruhr-University of Bochum, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects before inclusion in the study. Clinical evaluation, spirometric tests, nasal lavage, induced sputum, specimen processing and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction were carried out as described by Rohde et al [2] . Elution volume was 100 µl. cDNA was generated with random-hexamer primers as previously published[2]. A hMPV-specific real-time RT-PCR designed and evaluated by Maertzdorf et al was used [22] . Primers and probe are localized within the nucleoprotein gene (NL-N) and the presence of a degenerate base within the probe allows detection of all four genetic lineages of hMPV. The assays were performed using the TaqMan ® PCR Core Kit. The final volume was 25 µl containing 500 nM of the forward primer (NL-N-forward (5'-CATATAAGCAT-GCTATATTAAAAGAGTCTC-3')), 250 nM of the reverse primer (NL-N-reverse (5'-CCTATTTCTGCAGCATATTTG-TAATCAG-3')) and 500 nM of the probe (NL-N-probe (5'-FAM-TGYAATGATGAGGGTGTCACTGCGGTTG-TAMRA-3', in which Y is either a C or a T residue). Nuclease-free water was used as negative control and a plasmid containing the N gene of hMPV (kindly provided by James Simon, VIRONOVATIVE, EUR Holding, Erasmus University Rotterdam) was used as a positive control in all PCR runs. Cycling parameters were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Amplification and detection of RNA from virus isolates or clinical specimens were performed using the GeneAmp ® 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The real-time PCR product was cloned with the QIAGEN ® PCR cloning kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and this standard plasmid DNA was used for absolute quantification of hMPV viral load. Calculations were performed as previously described for absolute quantification of RSV viral load [23] . The primary objective of this study was to compare the frequency of hMPV detection in respiratory specimens between COPD patients with or without an acute exacerbation and smokers without COPD. Continuous data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data were of non-parametrical distribution and results were expressed as median and range. Differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test. To further analyse significant differences between two individual groups a pair wise comparison by two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. All significance levels were set to 5%. Data were analysed and processed using SPSS Version 12.0 on a Windows XP operating system. A total of 229 subjects were investigated between October 1999 and June 2004: 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. The clinical characteristics and lung function measurements are summarized in table 1. FEV 1 , FEV 1 in % of predicted value and FEV 1 /FVC were normal in smokers, significantly decreased in stable COPD patients (all) and further significantly decreased in AE-COPD patients (all p < 0.05 compared to stable COPD and all p < 0.001 compared to smokers). HMPV could be detected in three subjects. All these subjects were AE-COPD patients. The prevalence of hMPV in AE-COPD patients was 2.3%. The virus was simultaneously detected in nasal lavage and induced sputum in one patient only. The viral load was about 100 times higher in nasal lavage than in induced sputum in this patient. Overall the viral load in nasal lavage was about 3.5 times higher compared to induced sputum (for details see table 2). The hMPV positive patients did not differ significantly from other AE-COPD patients when clinical parameters and lung function were analysed. hMPV was detected in the winter season only. The main finding of this controlled study investigating the incidence of hMPV in subjects with COPD and smokers without COPD is that this recently discovered respiratory virus was detectable only during exacerbation of COPD. The frequency of detection was very low but in positive cases the viral load was considerable. There was no detection in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. Recently Vicente et al [19] reported about the incidence of hMPV in 89 COPD patients. Five patients (5.5%) were hMPV positive. Two of these patients had to be transferred to hospital. Although this was not a controlled study and not all details of the study are available due to the fact that the data were published in form of a letter, these results support our findings. The incidence of hMPV in this and in our study is low compared to other respiratory viruses. In a similar previous study we found that Picornaviruses were detectable in 36% of AE-COPD patients, Influenza A in 25% and Respiratory syncytial virus in 22%[2]. There is another prospective cohort study of adults in which hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly from long term care facilities [17] . Unfortunately this report does not specify how many of the elderly patients suffered from COPD. In our asymptomatic smokers without COPD hMPV could not be detected. A recent study investigating nasal secretions from adults with and without respiratory illnesses found hMPV in 5 of 146 ill patient and in none of 158 control subjects, strongly supporting our data [24] . A further recent study found hMPV in two out of 111 adult patients (1.8%) who presented to the emergency department for AE-COPD during 2 winter/ spring seasons in Quebec, Canada, also in support of our findings [25] . In a US American study investigating clinical samples collected between 1991 and 1995, hMPV could not be detected at all in 196 patients indicating important geographical and seasonal differences in hMPV prevalence [26] . Taken together the results presented here are in keeping with other studies in adults and add important information on the prevalence of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. To our knowledge this is the first study analysing the viral load of hMPV in COPD patients. We found a mean of 6.5 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in induced sputum. These values indicate that hMPV may have been the infectious agent triggering exacerbation in these patients. Viral load cut-off values for infectivity in COPD exacerbations have not been studied in detail yet and need further investigation. However, viral loads between 1120 copies/ml in Cytomegalovirus infection in lung-transplant patients [27] and 5.8log 10 copies/ ml in SARS [28] have been considered to indicate infectious disease. Moreover hMPV was only found in acute exacerbation and not in stable disease or in smokers without COPD supporting a triggering role in AE-COPD. HMPV infection can be severe since it was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . Our hMPV positive patients did not differ in their clinical characteristics or lung function from the other AE-COPD patients which does not indicate a more severe course of AE-COPD in these patients. Taken together this is the first controlled study on the relevance of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. HMPV was detected in a very low frequency but with noticeable viral load in AE-COPD patients. Given that asymptomatic carriage of hMPV is very unlikely it should be considered as another possible trigger of AE-COPD. Since every AE-COPD has considerable impact on the course of the disease and regional outbreaks of hMPV are possible it should be included into future diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.  The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.",

The frequency of detection was very low but in positive cases the viral load was considerable. There was no detection in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. Recently Vicente et al [19] reported about the incidence of hMPV in 89 COPD patients. Five patients (5.5%) were hMPV positive. Two of these patients had to be transferred to hospital. Although this was not a controlled study and not all details of the study are available due to the fact that the data were published in form of a letter, these results support our findings. The incidence of hMPV in this and in our study is low compared to other respiratory viruses. In a similar previous study we found that Picornaviruses were detectable in 36% of AE-COPD patients, Influenza A in 25% and Respiratory syncytial virus in 22%[2]. There is another prospective cohort study of adults in which hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly from long term care facilities [17] . Unfortunately this report does not specify how many of the elderly patients suffered from COPD. In our asymptomatic smokers without COPD hMPV could not be detected. A recent study investigating nasal secretions from adults with and without respiratory illnesses found hMPV in 5 of 146 ill patient and in none of 158 control subjects, strongly supporting our data [24] . A further recent study found hMPV in two out of 111 adult patients (1.8%) who presented to the emergency department for AE-COPD during 2 winter/ spring seasons in Quebec, Canada, also in support of our findings [25] . In a US American study investigating clinical samples collected between 1991 and 1995, hMPV could not be detected at all in 196 patients indicating important geographical and seasonal differences in hMPV prevalence [26] . Taken together the results presented here are in keeping with other studies in adults and add important information on the prevalence of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. To our knowledge this is the first study analysing the viral load of hMPV in COPD patients. We found a mean of 6.5 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10 5 viral copies/ml in induced sputum. These values indicate that hMPV may have been the infectious agent triggering exacerbation in these patients. Viral load cut-off values for infectivity in COPD exacerbations have not been studied in detail yet and need further investigation. However, viral loads between 1120 copies/ml in Cytomegalovirus infection in lung-transplant patients [27] and 5.8log 10 copies/ ml in SARS [28] have been considered to indicate infectious disease. Moreover hMPV was only found in acute exacerbation and not in stable disease or in smokers without COPD supporting a triggering role in AE-COPD. HMPV infection can be severe since it was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . Our hMPV positive patients did not differ in their clinical characteristics or lung function from the other AE-COPD patients which does not indicate a more severe course of AE-COPD in these patients. Taken together this is the first controlled study on the relevance of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. HMPV was detected in a very low frequency but with noticeable viral load in AE-COPD patients. Given that asymptomatic carriage of hMPV is very unlikely it should be considered as another possible trigger of AE-COPD. Since every AE-COPD has considerable impact on the course of the disease and regional outbreaks of hMPV are possible it should be included into future diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

         "Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey",
         "BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.",

         "In Japan, cancer has been recognized as a major component of the overall pattern of disease for decades. Thus, the importance of cancer prevention by lifestyle modification should now be strongly acknowledged. Internationally, several studies have estimated the proportion of total cancer deaths attributable to various risk factors based on epidemiologic evidence [1, 2] , and various international guidelines and recommendations derived from these have appeared [3] [4] [5] [6] . Not surprisingly, domestic guidelines and recommendations for cancer prevention in Japan such as the 'Twelve recommendations for cancer prevention [7]' and 'Healthy People Japan 21 [8] ' have been significantly influenced by these reports. Public awareness of risk factors in relation to cancer prevention has been surveyed in only a few countries [9, 10] , and results have demonstrated poor awareness. Other studies focusing on specific cancers only have also appeared [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, none of these studies quantitatively evaluated public awareness of the attributable fraction of individual risk factors. In Japan, it appears that most people are aware of the major risk factors of cancer. Although we are unaware of any published evidence, however, public knowledge and information on cancer prevention now seems influenced largely by the mass media and other sources, rather than by information provided directly by health professionals, resulting in a distorted picture of causation. Cancer control policy therefore urgently requires a clarification of the discrepancies which now exist between ideal levels of public concern about risk factors and the current reality, particularly public health policy makers in their formulation of cancer control measures. To address this need, the present study was designed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. Since we are interested in quantitatively estimating the awareness of preventability, we placed special emphasis on gauging awareness by attributable fraction of cancer. The study was conducted as a part of an omnibus survey in December, 2003, by commission to a polling agency. The omnibus survey is a monthly multipurpose cross-sectional survey which includes public opinion research, social research, scientific research, market research, and others. Using a stratified two-stage sampling method, a total of 2,000 people aged 20 or older were randomly selected as study subjects, from 160 districts selected from area units representing 12 geographical blocks (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Keihin, Koshinetu, Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Hanshin, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu) and 3 types of city scale (14 metropolises, other cities, towns and villages) in proportion to the population distribution as at March 2002. After an initial visit to obtain oral informed consent and schedule a visit for the interview, the survey was conducted by face-to-face interview using trained interviewers in each district. The omnibus survey does not collect any personally identifiable information such as name, date of birth or address details at interview. For the present report, we obtained the electronic data file for the relevant interview component, with no personal identifiers. Ethical approval was not applicable to the present study under the Japanese ethical guidelines for epidemiologic studies, which comply with the declaration of Helsinki. Among the 2,000 people selected for survey (977 men, 1,023 women), interviews were successfully obtained The questionnaire of this survey comprised questions on the awareness of various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention by enquiring about the attributable fraction of cancer. Fractions were: 1) 12 risk factor candidates, namely alcoholic beverages, unbalanced diet, use of food additives and pesticide chemicals, charred fish and meat, tobacco smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, air pollution such as diesel emissions, occupational exposure, cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection, and stress; 2) genetic factors in general; and 3) the preventable fraction of cancer occurrence by lifestyle modification [see Additional file 1]. The first question asked about the preventable fraction of cancer which would result in Japan if each factor were completely and totally eliminated, using the fine categories of <5%, 5 to <10%, 10 to <15%, 15 to <20%, 20 to <25%, 25 to <30%, 30 to <40%, 40 to <50%, 50 to <60%, 60 to <70%, 70 to <80%, 80 to <90%, and 90 to 100%. These categories were exhibited together on a pie chart. These risk factor candidates were selected with reference to previous international and domestic recommendations and guidelines [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The second question asked about the fraction of cancer genetically predetermined using the same categories as the first, while the third asked about the preventable fraction of cancer by modification of lifestyle using estimation of an actual percent value. In addition to these questions, subjects were also asked about their smoking and drinking practices, and occupational and educational status. Mean values of the attributable fractions were calculated for each risk factor of cancer and compared by demographic and habitual smoking and drinking status. For analyses, the mid-values of each category were assigned for categorical variables. All analyses were performed using Stata statistical software, S/E Version 8 [15] . A total of 1,355 (67.8%) subjects responded to the survey, with a higher response rate in women (72.9%) than in men (62.3%). Response rate was lower in the 20s age strata than in the other age groups, but no trend to an increase in response rate with increasing age was observed. Overall, no significant difference in area and age distribution was seen between the sampled population and survey respondents. Response rate tended to be lower among subjects who reside in the Kanto region and in cities other than the 14 metropolises than among other subjects ( Table 1) . Characteristics of the 1,355 respondents (609 men, 746 women) are presented in Table 2 . The proportion of current smokers was 44% in men and 15% in women, and decreased with age in both genders. In female subjects aged in their 20s, 26% currently smoke and 49% drink alcohol beverages at least 4 times a week. Awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population is presented in Table 3 . Among the 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction was considered highest for cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection (51.3%), followed by tobacco smoking (43.0%), stress (39.0%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37.1%). In contrast, the attributable fraction of charred fish and meat (21.4%) and alcohol drinking (21.7%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. The attributable fraction of other risk factor candidates such as occupational exposure, air pollution, food additives and pesticides, unbalanced diet, obesity and physical activity ranked between the high and low fractions. The attributable fraction responses tended to be higher in women than in men, and were increased among inhabitants of larger cities and in homemakers and decreased in those engaged in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, risk factor candidate rankings were similar by gender, age group, city scale, and educational and occupational status. In men, those who neither smoke nor drink tended to consider the preventive fraction of the risk factors higher than those who both smoke and drink, whereas in women, the former subjects considered the values lower than the latter. The speculated fraction of cancer which is genetically determined was 31.5% as an average (Table 3 ). This fraction was higher in current heavy smokers and former drinkers, and lower in homemakers and students. On the other hand, an average 35.5% of cancer were considered preventable by lifestyle improvement, with this ratio being higher in homemakers, former smokers, and never and former drinkers. The present survey, targeted at the Japanese general population, showed that the attributable fraction of cancer among Japanese tended to be higher for cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives than major lifestyle factors such as dietary factors. In addition, the attributable fraction of cancer estimated by the Japanese general population was higher than that derived from epidemiologic evidence in the West, which is frequently quoted as 30% for tobacco smoking and 30% for food as a whole [1, 2] . Some of the major cancers in Japan, including gastric and liver cancers, are known to be related to cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection, and a higher level of concern about such infection among Japanese than in Western populations would therefore be understandable [9] . Notwithstanding the validity of such concern, however, the high level of concern for infection, as well as for endocrine-disrupting chemicals, identified in the present survey was most likely due to the severe acute respiratory Likewise, a high level of concern for tobacco smoking was also observed, in spite of a relatively dull reduction in the rate of male current smokers in past decades compared with the U.S. This was probably due to recent enactment of the Health Promotion Law, which curbs passive smoking in public spaces. Respondent estimates for attributable fractions were generally high. This may be in part due to anchoring and adjustment effects of the response categories used and the tendency of people to respond near the middle of the scale. Given that responses tended to be generally high, concern over the present results should probably be focused on rankings rather than absolute values per se. Although tobacco smoking ranked among the top factors, risk factor candidates whose actual contribution is considered to be low, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, occupational exposure, air pollution such as diesel emissions and the use of food additives and pesticide chemicals ranked higher than previous estimates of the attributable fraction of cancer causes [1, 2] . In contrast, this should be compared with the results for unbalanced diet, which ranked at only 8th among the 12 risk factor candidates despite an actual ranking which is estimated to be as high as that for tobacco smoking. Particularly in light of findings on long-term exposure to common lifestyle factors such as diet as a cause of cancer, these results suggest that public awareness of cancer prevention is still insufficient. We are unaware of any previous studies aimed at determining public awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer as a whole or at gauging the level the awareness of cancer prevention by attributable fraction. Accordingly, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to discover the level of awareness for each risk factor candidate, and the questionnaire used has hence not been fully validated. In addition, as indicated above, responses to this type of cross sectional survey are subject to social conditions such as information from the mass media and other sources on disease epidemics and other putative risk factors. Thus, the results might not necessarily reflect actual public awareness. However, the study subjects were recruited from among a nationally representative random sample, and the response rate was similar to that of recent omnibus surveys in other countries [16] [17] [18] [19] . Nevertheless, the exclusion of non-respondents may have distorted the results. In conclusion, awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population tended to be dominated by infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than dietary factors. The results of the present survey provide valuable clues and perspectives toward the formulation of relevant cancer prevention strategies in Japan.",

         "Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung",
         "To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.",

         "A. miRNA definition, biology and function Discovery of microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 was the first short non-coding RNA discovered in 1993 as a regulator of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans [1] . The first non-coding RNA identified in humans was let-7, which has been found involved in the control of developmental timing in humans and animals [2, 3] . Soon it became evident that these short non-coding RNAs are a part of much larger class of non-coding RNAs and the term microRNA (miRNA) was introduced [4] . To date, more than 900 miRNAs in Homo sapiens have been identified (940 in miRBase v15). MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs~22 nucleotides (nt) long involved in the negative post-transcriptional gene regulation via RNA interference mechanism [5, 6] . The sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among plants-microorganisms-animals, suggesting that miRNAs represent a relatively old and important regulatory pathway [7] . MiRNAs belong to the most abundant class of human gene regulators [8] : up to a third of the human genes are regulated by miRNAs [9] . MiRNAs are, therefore, key regulators of numerous genes in biological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis [e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ]. It has been speculated that miRNAs may be associated with the regulation of almost every aspect of cell physiology [8] . MiRNA genes are localized in the non-coding regions or in the introns of protein-coding genes in the genomic DNA. The miRNA genes are much longer than biologically active, mature miRNAs which originate through a multistep process [15] (Figure 1 ). Briefly, transcription by the RNA polymerase II leads to hundred or thousand nucleotides long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) [16] . A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/ Pasha to 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) [17] in a process known as \"cropping\" [18, 19] . Pre-miRNAs are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [20, 21] . In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes [17, 20] . One strand of the short-lived miRNA duplex is degraded (\"passenger\" strand, miR*), whereas the other (\"guide\", miR) strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA [8] . Selection of the \"guide\" strand is based on the base pairing stability of both dsRNA ends [22, 23] . Depending on the complementarity between miRNA and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA there are two known mechanisms of miRNAs action on mRNAs: 1) target mRNA degradation and 2) translational inhibition with little or no influence on mRNA levels [24] (Figure 2) . Firstly, the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of the target mRNA occurs when miRNA is near-perfectly complementary with target mRNA [25, 26] . A recent study proved that mRNA degradation represents the major mechanism of miRNA regulation [27] . The authors showed that about 84% of all protein-coding mRNA targets undergo degradation while recognized by their cognate miRNA [27] . Secondly, the translational inhibition MiRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from the genomic DNA as long (hundred or thousand nucleotides) primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/Pasha to produce a 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs in form of hairpins are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes, consisting of the \"guide\" (miR) strand and the \"passenger\" (miR*) strand. The \"passenger\" strand is degraded, the \"guide\" strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA, acting by two different mechanisms according to the complementarity with the target mRNA. Adopted from Kim [15] . occurs when miRNA is only partially complementary to its target mRNA [28] [29] [30] . In light of the recent study by Guo et al [27] , this mechanism does not represent a predominant reason for reduced protein output. Besides the complementarity between miRNA and mRNA, several other factors may influence the miRNA action such as impaired processing, methylation, gene polymorphisms, gene amplification, deletion of Dicer, translocations and others [31] . It is evident that single miRNAs may regulate translation of numerous downstream mRNAs and each mRNA is likely to be regulated by several miRNAs simultaneously [30, 32] . Thus, identification of miRNA target genes has been a great challenge [33] . Numerous computational algorithms [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] were established which combined 5' seed matches, thermodynamic stability and conservation analysis in order to maximize specificity when predicting mRNA targets [44] (Table 1) . Nevertheless, various algorithms differ in the selection of mRNA targets and simultaneous application of several algorithms is, therefore, highly recommended. Nowadays, many web-based applications [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] have been developed by combining existing prediction programs with functional annotations associated to many miRNA, gene, protein or biological pathway resources such as miR-Base, Ensembl, Swiss-Prot, UCSC genome browser, KEGG pathway and other databases [44] (Table 2) . However, because of high similarities in miRNA sequences, computational algorithms may predict a large number of putative miRNA binding sites on mRNA targets [33] . Thus, experimental validation in biological system is fundamental to complete the target prediction [44] ; the currently available methods [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] are listed in Table 3 . Of these, antagomir studies or immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs have been specifically developed for miRNA-mRNA studies. Antagomirs represent a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides used to silence endogenous microRNAs [64, 65] . Immunoprecipitation is then based on the observation that each member of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family (catalytic components of the RNA-induced silencing complex) can bind to miRNAs and to partially complementary sequences in the 3'-UTR of specific target mRNAs. Thus, using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against members of the Ago protein family, Ago-bound mRNAs can be co-immunoprecipitated [66, 67] . The lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile, highly conserved across mammalian species [68, 69] . However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung compartment is still limited and it is based mainly on the studies in animal models. MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in 1) the lung development and homeostasis, 2) in inflammation and viral infections and 3) miRNA deregulation may contribute to several pulmonary diseases ( Figure 3 ). Hereby, we summarize the knowledge of the involvement of miRNAs in the lung and current information on their posttranscriptional regulation ongoing in the lung compartment. Besides pathology we pay attention also to physiological lung because understanding miRNA function in normal condition is prerequisite to description of its involvement in disease. Several miRNAs such as miR-155, miR-26a, let-7, miR-29, miR-15/miR-16, miR-223, miR-146a/b and the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to be involved in homeostasis and in the lung development ( Table 4 ). The pulmonary role of miR-155 was studied in murine lung, where it has been shown that miR-155 is crucially involved in the differentiation of naive T-cells into Th1 and Th2 cells [70, 71] . Mice deficient in bic/miR-155 became immunodeficient and displayed increased lung remodelling, higher bronchoalveolar leukocytes and impaired T-and B-cell responses to inflammatory stimuli [70] . Another member of miRNA family, miR-26a, has been shown to be selectively expressed in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in murine lung [72] . Target mRNA of miR-26a is the transcription factor SMAD1, which is involved in the regulation of bone morphogenic protein signalling during lung development and pulmonary vascular remodelling [73, 74] . Thus, miR-26a might be important in controlling essential developmental and physiological events in the lung [75] . Also the miR-17-92 cluster is believed to regulate the lung development because its expression is high in embryonic development and steadily declines through development into adulthood [76] . Mice deficient in the miR-17-92 cluster died shortly after birth and lung hypoplasia/ventricular septal defects were demonstrated; moreover the absence of the miR-17-92 cluster let to upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and inhibition of B-cell development [77] . On the other side, the overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster in murine models resulted in an abnormal phenotype manifested by absence of terminal air sacs, which were replaced by highly proliferative, undifferentiated pulmonary epithelium [76] . Other miRNAs found to be involved in the pulmonary homeostasis are members of let-7 family [78] , miR-29 [79] , miR-15 and miR-16 [80, 81] , which Northern blot analysis [54] Quantitative real-time PCR [55] Ribonuclease protection assay [56] in situ hybridization [57] , [58] miRNA mimics [59] Western blot [60] Immunocytochemistry [61] Bead-based flow cytometry method [62] Suppression of miRNA expression in cells by antisense locked-nucleic acid oligonucleotides [63] Antagomir assays [64] , [65] Immunoprecipitation of Ago-bound mRNAs [66] , [67] function as tumor suppressors in lung cells. In addition, another miRNA, miR-223, has been shown to be crucial for normal granulocyte development and function in the lung [82] . MiR-223 mutant mice spontaneously developed neutrophilic lung inflammation with tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge [82] . Two miRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b, have been shown to play central role in the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation; the mechanism is down-regulation of two proteins IRAK1 and TRAF6 involved in Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) signalling [83, 84] . Also other miRNAs have been shown to regulate the inflammation in mouse lung exposed to aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS): miR-21, -25, -27b, -100, -140, -142-3p, -181c, -187, -194, -214, -223 and -224 [72] . Increase in these miRNAs correlated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as TNFα [72] . The deregulation of miR-155, the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-223, miRNAs involved in lung development and homeostasis, resulted in the uncontrolled lung inflammation in murine models [70, 77, 82] . Based on the studies in murine models, there is evidence that miRNA expression may influence also the course of pulmonary viral infections [85, 86] . MiR-200a and miR-223 were detected in lethal influenza virus infection presumably contributing to the extreme miR-155 important for normal lung airway remodelling (A) [70] alteration of T-cell differentiation (A) [71] miR-26a highly expressed within bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, important for lung development (H) [75] let-7 highly expressed in normal lung tissue, functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [78] miR-29 functions as tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [79] miR-15, miR-16 function as tumor suppressor genes (H) [80] , [81] miR-223 control of granulocyte development and function (A) [82] miR-146a/b central to the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation (H) [83] , [84] miR-200a, miR-223 contribution to the extreme virulence of the r1918 influenza virus (A) [85] miR-17 family, miR-574-5p, miR-214 upregulated at the onset of SARS infection (A, H) [86] virulence of the r1918 influenza virus [85] . MiR-17 family, miR-574-5p and miR-214 were upregulated at the onset of SARS infection: these miRNAs may help the virus to evade the host immune system and are responsible for effective transmission at the initial stage of viral infection [86] . There is evidence that upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs is critical for the lung development/homeostasis and thus may contribute to development of pathological pulmonary conditions, namely to smokingrelated diseases including lung cancerogenesis, fibrosis, and other immune-mediated disorders including allergy (Table 5) . Recent studies have implicated the miRNAs in the pathogenesis of immune system mediated pulmonary diseases. Tan and colleagues [87] described that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-G, a known asthma-susceptibility gene, disrupts the binding sites of three miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-148b, miR-152) targeting this gene. Thus, it is likely that the association of the HLA-G gene to asthma-susceptibility may be due to the allele-specific regulation of this gene by miRNAs [87] . MiR-21 is a further miRNA crucially involved in allergic lung inflammation. Its molecular target is IL-12p35, a cytokine contributing to polarization of Th cells toward Th2 cells [88] . MiR-126 is another miRNA found to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airways disease [89] . The blockade of miR-126 suppressed the asthmatic phenotype leading to diminished Th2 responses, suppression of inflammation, reduced airways hyperresponsiveness, inhibition of eosinophil recruitment, and lower mucus hypersecretion [89] . In bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα, let-7, miR-29a and miR-155 have been involved in the regulation of allergic inflammation [90] . Multiple members of let-7 family were also found upregulated in experimental asthma model and the pro-inflammatory role of let-7 miRNAs on the allergic cytokine expression was confirmed [91] . Another study showed that expression of RhoA in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs), a new target for asthma therapy, is negatively regulated by miR-133a [92] . The same group later revealed that IL-13 is capable of reducing the miR-133a expression in BSMCs and that the miR-133a downregulation causes an Table 5 MiRNAs involved in pathological processes in the lung miRNA Function (A animal studies, H human studies) References miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster deregulation results in uncontrolled inflammation (A) [70] , [71] , [77] miR-21, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-181c, miR-223, miR-224 increased following exposure to LPS (A) [72] miR-155 overexpressed in solid tumors, inhibition of tumor suppressor genes (A, H) [81] miR-223 impaired granulocyte function, regulator of granulocyte production and inflammatory response (A) [82] miR-148a/b, miR-152 allele-specific regulation of asthma susceptibility HLA-G gene (H) [87] miR-21 key role in asthma (A) [88] overexpressed in solid malignancies (A, H) [103] up-regulated in bleomycin-induced fibrosis and IPF (A, H) [110] miR-126 suppression of the asthmatic phenotype by blockade of miR-126 (A) [89] downregulated in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (H) [111] let-7, miR-29a, miR-155 regulation of allergic inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells (A, H) [90] let-7 pro-inflammatory effect in experimental asthma (A) [91] role in lung cancer progression (H) [99] miR-133a regulator of expression of RhoA, target for asthma therapy (A, H) [92] , [93] miR-146a reduced expression in COPD fibroblasts (H) [95] miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294 deregulated due to smoking (A, H) [96, 97] miR-218 tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (H) [98] miR-17-92 cluster overexpressed in lung cancers (H) [102] miR-34 regulation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells (H) [105] [106] [107] miR-210 overexpressed in lung cancer (H) [108] let-7d pro-fibrotic effect in pulmonary fibrosis (A, H) [109] upregulation of RhoA, presumably resulting in an augmentation of the contraction [93] . Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure [94] . Although extensive studies of the involvement of miRNAs in lung cancer have been performed, there are only few reports focused on the role of miRNAs in COPD. Recent study on fibroblasts from COPD subjects stimulated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines released less miR-146a than smokers without COPD [95] . The reduced miR-146a expression resulted in prolonged mRNA half-life of cyclooxygenase-2, thus increasing prostaglandin E2 in fibroblasts from COPD subjects [95] . There is evidence that smoking has influence also on other miRNAs. Expression profiling study in the rats exposed to environmental cigarette smoke revealed 24 downregulated miRNAs (especially let-7 family, miR-10, [96] . MiR-294, a known inhibitor of transcriptional repressor genes, was the only miRNA upregulated in smoke-exposed rats [96] . In another study, bronchial airway epithelial cells from current and never smokers differed in the expression of 28 miRNAs (especially miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294) in comparison to smokers, whereas the majority of deregulated miRNAs were downregulated in smokers [97] . Similar observation was observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where downregulation of miR-218 was associated with a history of cigarette smoking [98] . However, the majority of miRNA studies in smokingrelated diseases are focused on the role of miRNAs in lung cancer. Altered expression of miR-155 and let-7 has been reported in lung adenocarcinoma and expression of let-7 related to patient survival [99] . Moreover, it has been shown that let-7 may also play a role in lung cancer progression [99] [100] [101] . Further, increased expression of the miR-17-92 cluster has also been detected in lung cancer [102] . Another miRNAs involved in lung cancerogenesis are miR-21 and miR-34 families. MiR-21 was shown to regulate multiple tumor/metastasis suppressor genes in lung solid tumors [103] . MiR-34a/b/c have been identified to be a component of the p53 tumor suppressor network: p53 upregulates in response to DNA damage the members of miR-34 family [104] , thus regulating genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis [105] [106] [107] . Furthermore, miR-210 has been overexpressed in late stages of lung cancer, thus mediated mitochondrial alterations associated with modulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity [108] . Next, miR-218 was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer [98] . Recently, it was reported that miRNAs may play pivotal regulatory role also in the fibrotic processes ongoing in the lung: the downregulation of let-7 d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in the pro-fibrotic effects [109] . Also, upregulation of miR-21 was reported in the lungs of IPF patients and in the murine lungs with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas miR-21 expression was enhanced by pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 [110] . Another disease associated with miRNA change was cystic fibrosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was detected in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and its expression correlated with upregulation of TOM1 mRNA both in vitro and in vivo [111] . TOM1, a miR-126 target, was reported to be involved in the regulation of innate immune responses through its involvement in the TLR2/4 and IL-1β and TNF-α-induced signalling pathways [111] . Small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal role in the posttranscriptional regulation of numerous human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. There is evidence that the lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile undergoing changes during the lung development. Studies namely in animal models have provided evidence that miRNAs participate in lung homeostasis and play pivotal role also in the control of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections. Recent studies showed evidence that upregulated or downregulated expression of various miRNAs play an active role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Specific miRNA expression profiles were characterized for smoking related-diseases including COPD and lung cancer, immune-mediated pulmonary diseases and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, several miRNAs crucial for lung development and homeostasis such as let-7, miR-155 or miR-19-72 cluster have been identified to be deregulated in pulmonary allergy, asthma or lung cancer. The knowledge of altered miRNA expression profiles in diseased lung may thus offer new insights in the biology of pulmonary diseases. Moreover, miRNAs may represent attractive novel diagnostic biomarkers mainly due to their higher stability when compared to mRNAs [112] and could potentially provide possibilities for therapeutic intervention [31, 113, 114] .",
         "Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung. To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.. A. miRNA definition, biology and function Discovery of microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 was the first short non-coding RNA discovered in 1993 as a regulator of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans [1] . The first non-coding RNA identified in humans was let-7, which has been found involved in the control of developmental timing in humans and animals [2, 3] . Soon it became evident that these short non-coding RNAs are a part of much larger class of non-coding RNAs and the term microRNA (miRNA) was introduced [4] . To date, more than 900 miRNAs in Homo sapiens have been identified (940 in miRBase v15). MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs~22 nucleotides (nt) long involved in the negative post-transcriptional gene regulation via RNA interference mechanism [5, 6] . The sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among plants-microorganisms-animals, suggesting that miRNAs represent a relatively old and important regulatory pathway [7] . MiRNAs belong to the most abundant class of human gene regulators [8] : up to a third of the human genes are regulated by miRNAs [9] . MiRNAs are, therefore, key regulators of numerous genes in biological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis [e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ]. It has been speculated that miRNAs may be associated with the regulation of almost every aspect of cell physiology [8] . MiRNA genes are localized in the non-coding regions or in the introns of protein-coding genes in the genomic DNA. The miRNA genes are much longer than biologically active, mature miRNAs which originate through a multistep process [15] (Figure 1 ). Briefly, transcription by the RNA polymerase II leads to hundred or thousand nucleotides long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) [16] . A local stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs is then cleaved in the nucleus by the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease Drosha/ Pasha to 70 nucleotides long precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) [17] in a process known as \"cropping\" [18, 19] . Pre-miRNAs are then actively transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [20, 21] . In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by RNase III Dicer into~22-nt miRNA duplexes [17, 20] . One strand of the short-lived miRNA duplex is degraded (\"passenger\" strand, miR*), whereas the other (\"guide\", miR) strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serves as a functional, mature miRNA [8] . Selection of the \"guide\" strand is based on the base pairing stability of both dsRNA ends [22, 23] . Depending on the complementarity between miRNA and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA there are two known mechanisms of miRNAs action on mRNAs: 1) target mRNA degradation and 2) translational inhibition with little or no influence on mRNA levels [24] (Figure 2) .

It is evident that single miRNAs may regulate translation of numerous downstream mRNAs and each mRNA is likely to be regulated by several miRNAs simultaneously [30, 32] . Thus, identification of miRNA target genes has been a great challenge [33] .

Nevertheless, various algorithms differ in the selection of mRNA targets and simultaneous application of several algorithms is, therefore, highly recommended.

The deregulation of miR-155, the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-223, miRNAs involved in lung development and homeostasis, resulted in the uncontrolled lung inflammation in murine models [70, 77, 82] . Based on the studies in murine models, there is evidence that miRNA expression may influence also the course of pulmonary viral infections [85, 86] . MiR-200a and miR-223 were detected in lethal influenza virus infection presumably contributing to the extreme miR-155 important for normal lung airway remodelling (A) [70] alteration of T-cell differentiation (A) [71] miR-26a highly expressed within bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, important for lung development (H) [75] let-7 highly expressed in normal lung tissue, functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [78] miR-29 functions as tumor suppressor in lung cells (H) [79] miR-15, miR-16 function as tumor suppressor genes (H) [80] , [81] miR-223 control of granulocyte development and function (A) [82] miR-146a/b central to the negative feedback regulation of IL-1β-induced inflammation (H) [83] , [84] miR-200a, miR-223 contribution to the extreme virulence of the r1918 influenza virus (A) [85] miR-17 family, miR-574-5p, miR-214 upregulated at the onset of SARS infection (A, H) [86] virulence of the r1918 influenza virus [85] . MiR-17 family, miR-574-5p and miR-214 were upregulated at the onset of SARS infection: these miRNAs may help the virus to evade the host immune system and are responsible for effective transmission at the initial stage of viral infection [86] . There is evidence that upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs is critical for the lung development/homeostasis and thus may contribute to development of pathological pulmonary conditions, namely to smokingrelated diseases including lung cancerogenesis, fibrosis, and other immune-mediated disorders including allergy (Table 5) . Recent studies have implicated the miRNAs in the pathogenesis of immune system mediated pulmonary diseases. Tan and colleagues [87] described that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'UTR of HLA-G, a known asthma-susceptibility gene, disrupts the binding sites of three miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-148b, miR-152) targeting this gene. Thus, it is likely that the association of the HLA-G gene to asthma-susceptibility may be due to the allele-specific regulation of this gene by miRNAs [87] . MiR-21 is a further miRNA crucially involved in allergic lung inflammation. Its molecular target is IL-12p35, a cytokine contributing to polarization of Th cells toward Th2 cells [88] . MiR-126 is another miRNA found to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airways disease [89] . The blockade of miR-126 suppressed the asthmatic phenotype leading to diminished Th2 responses, suppression of inflammation, reduced airways hyperresponsiveness, inhibition of eosinophil recruitment, and lower mucus hypersecretion [89] . In bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα, let-7, miR-29a and miR-155 have been involved in the regulation of allergic inflammation [90] . Multiple members of let-7 family were also found upregulated in experimental asthma model and the pro-inflammatory role of let-7 miRNAs on the allergic cytokine expression was confirmed [91] . Another study showed that expression of RhoA in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs), a new target for asthma therapy, is negatively regulated by miR-133a [92] . The same group later revealed that IL-13 is capable of reducing the miR-133a expression in BSMCs and that the miR-133a downregulation causes an Table 5 MiRNAs involved in pathological processes in the lung miRNA Function (A animal studies, H human studies) References miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster deregulation results in uncontrolled inflammation (A) [70] , [71] , [77] miR-21, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-181c, miR-223, miR-224 increased following exposure to LPS (A) [72] miR-155 overexpressed in solid tumors, inhibition of tumor suppressor genes (A, H) [81] miR-223 impaired granulocyte function, regulator of granulocyte production and inflammatory response (A) [82] miR-148a/b, miR-152 allele-specific regulation of asthma susceptibility HLA-G gene (H) [87] miR-21 key role in asthma (A) [88] overexpressed in solid malignancies (A, H) [103] up-regulated in bleomycin-induced fibrosis and IPF (A, H) [110] miR-126 suppression of the asthmatic phenotype by blockade of miR-126 (A) [89] downregulated in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (H) [111] let-7, miR-29a, miR-155 regulation of allergic inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells (A, H) [90] let-7 pro-inflammatory effect in experimental asthma (A) [91] role in lung cancer progression (H) [99] miR-133a regulator of expression of RhoA, target for asthma therapy (A, H) [92] , [93] miR-146a reduced expression in COPD fibroblasts (H) [95] miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294 deregulated due to smoking (A, H) [96, 97] miR-218 tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (H) [98] miR-17-92 cluster overexpressed in lung cancers (H) [102] miR-34 regulation of apoptosis in lung cancer cells (H) [105] [106] [107] miR-210 overexpressed in lung cancer (H) [108] let-7d pro-fibrotic effect in pulmonary fibrosis (A, H) [109] upregulation of RhoA, presumably resulting in an augmentation of the contraction [93] . Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure [94] . Although extensive studies of the involvement of miRNAs in lung cancer have been performed, there are only few reports focused on the role of miRNAs in COPD. Recent study on fibroblasts from COPD subjects stimulated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines released less miR-146a than smokers without COPD [95] . The reduced miR-146a expression resulted in prolonged mRNA half-life of cyclooxygenase-2, thus increasing prostaglandin E2 in fibroblasts from COPD subjects [95] . There is evidence that smoking has influence also on other miRNAs. Expression profiling study in the rats exposed to environmental cigarette smoke revealed 24 downregulated miRNAs (especially let-7 family, miR-10, [96] . MiR-294, a known inhibitor of transcriptional repressor genes, was the only miRNA upregulated in smoke-exposed rats [96] . In another study, bronchial airway epithelial cells from current and never smokers differed in the expression of 28 miRNAs (especially miR-218, miR-15a, miR-199b, miR-125a/b, miR-294) in comparison to smokers, whereas the majority of deregulated miRNAs were downregulated in smokers [97] . Similar observation was observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where downregulation of miR-218 was associated with a history of cigarette smoking [98] . However, the majority of miRNA studies in smokingrelated diseases are focused on the role of miRNAs in lung cancer. Altered expression of miR-155 and let-7 has been reported in lung adenocarcinoma and expression of let-7 related to patient survival [99] . Moreover, it has been shown that let-7 may also play a role in lung cancer progression [99] [100] [101] . Further, increased expression of the miR-17-92 cluster has also been detected in lung cancer [102] . Another miRNAs involved in lung cancerogenesis are miR-21 and miR-34 families. MiR-21 was shown to regulate multiple tumor/metastasis suppressor genes in lung solid tumors [103] . MiR-34a/b/c have been identified to be a component of the p53 tumor suppressor network: p53 upregulates in response to DNA damage the members of miR-34 family [104] , thus regulating genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis [105] [106] [107] . Furthermore, miR-210 has been overexpressed in late stages of lung cancer, thus mediated mitochondrial alterations associated with modulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity [108] . Next, miR-218 was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer [98] . Recently, it was reported that miRNAs may play pivotal regulatory role also in the fibrotic processes ongoing in the lung: the downregulation of let-7 d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in the pro-fibrotic effects [109] . Also, upregulation of miR-21 was reported in the lungs of IPF patients and in the murine lungs with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas miR-21 expression was enhanced by pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 [110] . Another disease associated with miRNA change was cystic fibrosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was detected in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and its expression correlated with upregulation of TOM1 mRNA both in vitro and in vivo [111] . TOM1, a miR-126 target, was reported to be involved in the regulation of innate immune responses through its involvement in the TLR2/4 and IL-1β and TNF-α-induced signalling pathways [111] . Small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal role in the posttranscriptional regulation of numerous human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. There is evidence that the lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile undergoing changes during the lung development. Studies namely in animal models have provided evidence that miRNAs participate in lung homeostasis and play pivotal role also in the control of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections. Recent studies showed evidence that upregulated or downregulated expression of various miRNAs play an active role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Specific miRNA expression profiles were characterized for smoking related-diseases including COPD and lung cancer, immune-mediated pulmonary diseases and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, several miRNAs crucial for lung development and homeostasis such as let-7, miR-155 or miR-19-72 cluster have been identified to be deregulated in pulmonary allergy, asthma or lung cancer. The knowledge of altered miRNA expression profiles in diseased lung may thus offer new insights in the biology of pulmonary diseases. Moreover, miRNAs may represent attractive novel diagnostic biomarkers mainly due to their higher stability when compared to mRNAs [112] and could potentially provide possibilities for therapeutic intervention [31, 113, 114] .",

         "A series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1–24 were prepared and first evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aR-configuration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration.

         "Plant viruses cause numerous diseases in a wide range of crop plant species and lead to an estimated $600 billion in annual losses worldwide [1] . Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of Tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world and has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. Most TMVs have infected a number of economically important crops and have induced general mosaic symptoms to cause significant economic losses worldwide [2] . It is found that in certain fields 90-100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. Therefore, this plant virus has the name ''plant cancer'' and is difficult to control. To control viral plant diseases, many approaches have been used, including chemicals, breeding, cross-protection and transgenic plants. However, there are no control measures that can totally inhibit plant viruses after they have infected plants. Ningnanmycin (Figure 1) , perhaps the most successful registered antiplant viral agent, displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 mg/mL. Ribavirin (Figure 1 ) is another widely used plantviral inhibitor, its inhibitory effects are also less than 50% at 500 mg/mL. Because of the unsatisfactory cure rate (30-60%) of common antiviral agents (Ningnanmycin, Ribavirin, Virus A, et al.) and economic loss of tobacco, many efforts have been done to develop novel, potent and structure concise antiviral agents. Some chemicals, such as triazolyl compounds [3] , pyrazole derivatives [4, 5] , cyanoacrylate derivatives [5, 6] , a-aminophosphonate derivatives [5, 7] , N-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-N9-phenylureas [8] , and some natural products [9] [10] [11] , have been found to possess antiviral activity. However, there are only a few reports on economically viable antiviral chemicals available for application in agriculture [12] , so there still lies a great deal of scope for further research in this field. Natural product-based agrochemicals offer advantages in that they can sometimes be specific to a target species and often have unique modes of action with little mammalian toxicity. Another benefit is their ability to decompose rapidly, thereby reducing their risk to the environment [13, 14] . An additional advantage is the natural products can be a candidate that possesses the desirable biological activities. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids are a small group of alkaloids existing in the Lauraceae, Vitaceae and Urticaceae family of plants. Only five of these alkaloids ((R)-cryptopleurine (2), (R)-boehmeriasin A (5), boehmeriasin B (18) , cryptopleuridine and (14aR,15R)-15-hydroxycryptopleurine (19) , Figure 1 ) have been isolated by now [15] [16] [17] [18] . It has been reported that these alkaloids possess unique and interesting biological properties including vesicant [15] , antimicrobial [19] , antiviral [20, 21] and anti-tumor [22] [23] [24] activities. To date, most of the studies have been focused on antitumor activity in medicinal formulation. However, there have been no reports about the anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids in pesticide formulation. In our previous work, the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid (2)antofine ( Figure 1 ) was isolated from the aerial parts of Cynanchum komarovii and was first found to have good antiviral activity against TMV in vitro [25] . Further antiviral mechanism studies revealed that antofine has favorable interaction with origin of TMV RNA (oriRNA), likely exerting its virus inhibition by binding to oriRNA and interfering with virus assembly initiation [26] . Although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . Did the phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids possess anti-TMV activity? Based on the above findings, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were prepared and systematically evaluated for their antiviral activity against TMV. The alkaloids 1-9 [27] , 18 [28] , 19-24 [27] and acids 25a-f [24] were prepared according to the corresponding reported procedures. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10-17 were synthesized by using a practical synthetic approach involving coupling of the phenanthrene ring with 2-bromopyridine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction and subsequent reduction of the resulting pyridyl ketone as key steps. As shown in Figure 2 , 2-bromopyridine was treated with n-BuLi at -78uC to afford 2-lithiopyridine, which reacted smoothly with 25a-f to give pyridyl ketones 26a-f, respectively. By using PtO 2 as the catalyst, the hydrogenation of 26a-e proceeded smoothly in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 50 atm to give 27a-e, respectively. It should be noted that pyridyl ketone 26f could not been reduced under above reduction condition. The reduction of 27a-e in Et 3 SiH/TFA at reflux afforded 28a-e, which were then converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 10-14, respectively, by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation. The hydrogenation of 26f was carried out at several different conditions. The best result is that treatment of compound 26f with PtO 2 in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 4:1) at 50 atm gave the carbonyl group reduced intermediate 29 in 53% yield. Reduction of 29 using the similar procedure for the preparation of 27a-e gave the key intermediate 30 in 92% yield, which was converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 15 by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation ( Figure 3) . In order to further evaluate the effect of 6-hydroxy group on antiviral activity, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 16 and 17 were designed and synthesized. Phenanthrene-9-carboxylic acid 34 was synthesized by employing 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetic acid and 4hydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting materials ( Figure 4) . Ester 33 was obtained by the conventional four steps previously reported in the literature [29] . Then hydrolysis of ester 33 gave acid 34, which was treated with 2-lithiopyridine to afford the desired ketone 35. The catalytic hydrogenation of 35 to give 38 was carried out under two different procedures. Treatment of compound 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst in reluxing methanol at 1 atm gave the alcohol 36 in 83% yield. Reduction of 36 using the Et 3 SiH/TFA system afforded the desired product 37, which was further reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 10 atm gave 38 in 82% yield. For another method, treatment of ketone 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org in reluxing acetic acid at 1 atm gave the key intermediate 38 in 59% yield. Then amino and phenol protection and Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation proceeded sequentially to give 40, which deprotection afforded phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 16 in 69% yield ( Figure 4) . Treatment of pyridine 37 with cyclopropylmethyl bromide obtained 41, which was reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in ethanol and conc. HCl (v/v 20:1) at 50 atm to afford the key intermediate 42. The Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation of 42 gave phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 17 in 80% yield ( Figure 5 ). The phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were first tested for their phytotoxic activity against the test plant, and the results indicated that these natural product-based compounds showed no phytotoxic activity at 500 mg/mL. The commercial plant virucide Ningnanmycin, perhaps the most successful registered anti-plant viral agent, Ribavirin and (R)antofine were used as the controls. In order to investigate the subsituent effects of phenanthrene moiety, a series of racemic phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1, 4, 7, and 10-18 were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activity (Table 1) . To our delight, all the racemic phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids displayed higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, of which cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin, thus emerged as novel potent lead compounds for anti-TMV agents. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. Cryptopleurine (1) exhibited significantly higher activity than alkaloid 7, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 7- Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org position of the phenanthrene moiety is beneficial for mataining excellent antiviral activity. Alkaloids 4 and 7 displayed about similar activity, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 2position of the phenanthrene moiety is tolerant. The 6-position of the phenanthrene moiety, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , really is a sensitive site: removal of 6-O methyl increased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 16.1; 18.2), which indicated that the 6-position may be a hydrogen donor site; replacement of 6-O methyl with 6-O cyclopropyl methyl significantly decreased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 1.17), which indicated that the steric effect is also a very important factor. Instead of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with methylenedioxyl is tolerant (antiviral activity: 7 < 10 < 11 < 12). However, replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with ethylenedioxyl significantly increased the anti-TMV activity, especially for 6,7-dimethoxyl (antiviral activity: 15.13.14.7). Further to investigated the effect of C 14a chirality on anti-TMV activity, a series of chiral phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 2 ). The (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids exhibited significantly higher activity than their enantiomers (antiviral activity: 2.3; 5.6; 8.9). The structure difference between (R)-cryptopleurine (2) and (R)-antofine lies in the ''E'' ring. (R)-Antofine with a 5-member ''E'' ring displayed inhibition activity of 42.7% inactivation effect, 46.0% curative effect and 45.5% protection effect at 500 mg/mL. However, (R)-cryptopleurine (2) with a 6-member ''E'' ring exhibited significantly higher in vivo antiviral activity than (R)-antofine even at 100 mg/mL. The results further indicated that although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . For (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 2.8); removal of 2-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 5.6). However, the (S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids displayed about similar moderate antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 3 < 6 < 9). In order to investigated the effect of 15-hydroxyl on antiviral activity, a series of 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 19-24 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 3 ). The bioassay results showed that the 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids also displayed good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which alkaloids 19, 20, 22 and 24 exhibited signigicantly higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, and alkaloids 19 and 22 displayed higher in vivo activity than Ningnanmycin at 100 mg/mL. The introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position significantly increased antiviral activity for (S)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 2.19; 5.21; 8.23), but decreased antiviral activity for (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 20.3; 22.6; 24.9). The (S,S)-enantiomers 22 and 24 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity than their corresponding enantiomers 21 and 23. However, the (S,S)-enantiomer 20 showed a lower activity than its enantiomer 19. For (14aS,15S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 20,24); removal of 2-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 22.24). For (14aR,15R)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids, removal of 7-methoxyl or 2methoxyl all increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 19.21.23).

The halves were immersed into the solution of 500 mg/mL of the compounds and double distilled water for 20 min, respectively, and then cultured at 25uC for 72 h. Each compound was replicated at least three times. Protective effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The compound solution was smeared on the left side and the solvent serving as control on the right side of growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) leaves of the same ages. The leaves were then inoculated with the virus after 12 h. A brush was dipped in TMV of 6 6 10 23 mg/mL to inoculate the leaves, which were previously scattered with silicon carbide. The leaves were then washed with water and rubbed softly along the nervature once or twice. The local lesion numbers appearing 3-4 days after inoculation were counted. There are three replicates for each compound. Inactivation effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The virus was inhibited by mixing with the compound solution at the same volume for 30 min. The mixture was then inoculated on the left side of the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc), whereas the right side of the leaves was inoculated with the mixture of solvent and the virus for control. The local lesion numbers were recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. Curative effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. Growing leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) of the same ages were selected. TMV (concentration of 6.0 6 10 23 mg/mL) was dipped and inoculated on the whole leaves. Then the leaves were washed with water and dried. The compound solution was smeared on the left side, and the solvent was smeared on the right side for control.

In summary, based on the literature report and our previous work, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were designed, prepared and evaluated for their anti-TMV activity for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo antiviral bioassays showed that most of these alkaloids exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aRconfiguration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased antiviral activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Further studies on mode of action are currently underway in our laboratories.

         "First Discovery and Stucture-Activity Relationship Study of Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Antiviral Agents against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). A series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1–24 were prepared and first evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aR-configuration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus.. Plant viruses cause numerous diseases in a wide range of crop plant species and lead to an estimated $600 billion in annual losses worldwide [1] . Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of Tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world and has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. Most TMVs have infected a number of economically important crops and have induced general mosaic symptoms to cause significant economic losses worldwide [2] . It is found that in certain fields 90-100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. Therefore, this plant virus has the name ''plant cancer'' and is difficult to control. To control viral plant diseases, many approaches have been used, including chemicals, breeding, cross-protection and transgenic plants. However, there are no control measures that can totally inhibit plant viruses after they have infected plants. Ningnanmycin (Figure 1) , perhaps the most successful registered antiplant viral agent, displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 mg/mL. Ribavirin (Figure 1 ) is another widely used plantviral inhibitor, its inhibitory effects are also less than 50% at 500 mg/mL. Because of the unsatisfactory cure rate (30-60%) of common antiviral agents (Ningnanmycin, Ribavirin, Virus A, et al.) and economic loss of tobacco, many efforts have been done to develop novel, potent and structure concise antiviral agents. Some chemicals, such as triazolyl compounds [3] , pyrazole derivatives [4, 5] , cyanoacrylate derivatives [5, 6] , a-aminophosphonate derivatives [5, 7] , N-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-N9-phenylureas [8] , and some natural products [9] [10] [11] , have been found to possess antiviral activity. However, there are only a few reports on economically viable antiviral chemicals available for application in agriculture [12] , so there still lies a great deal of scope for further research in this field. Natural product-based agrochemicals offer advantages in that they can sometimes be specific to a target species and often have unique modes of action with little mammalian toxicity. Another benefit is their ability to decompose rapidly, thereby reducing their risk to the environment [13, 14] . An additional advantage is the natural products can be a candidate that possesses the desirable biological activities. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids are a small group of alkaloids existing in the Lauraceae, Vitaceae and Urticaceae family of plants. Only five of these alkaloids ((R)-cryptopleurine (2), (R)-boehmeriasin A (5), boehmeriasin B (18) , cryptopleuridine and (14aR,15R)-15-hydroxycryptopleurine (19) , Figure 1 ) have been isolated by now [15] [16] [17] [18] . It has been reported that these alkaloids possess unique and interesting biological properties including vesicant [15] , antimicrobial [19] , antiviral [20, 21] and anti-tumor [22] [23] [24] activities. To date, most of the studies have been focused on antitumor activity in medicinal formulation. However, there have been no reports about the anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids in pesticide formulation. In our previous work, the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid (2)antofine ( Figure 1 ) was isolated from the aerial parts of Cynanchum komarovii and was first found to have good antiviral activity against TMV in vitro [25] . Further antiviral mechanism studies revealed that antofine has favorable interaction with origin of TMV RNA (oriRNA), likely exerting its virus inhibition by binding to oriRNA and interfering with virus assembly initiation [26] . Although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . Did the phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids possess anti-TMV activity? Based on the above findings, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were prepared and systematically evaluated for their antiviral activity against TMV. The alkaloids 1-9 [27] , 18 [28] , 19-24 [27] and acids 25a-f [24] were prepared according to the corresponding reported procedures. Phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10-17 were synthesized by using a practical synthetic approach involving coupling of the phenanthrene ring with 2-bromopyridine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction and subsequent reduction of the resulting pyridyl ketone as key steps. As shown in Figure 2 , 2-bromopyridine was treated with n-BuLi at -78uC to afford 2-lithiopyridine, which reacted smoothly with 25a-f to give pyridyl ketones 26a-f, respectively. By using PtO 2 as the catalyst, the hydrogenation of 26a-e proceeded smoothly in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 50 atm to give 27a-e, respectively. It should be noted that pyridyl ketone 26f could not been reduced under above reduction condition. The reduction of 27a-e in Et 3 SiH/TFA at reflux afforded 28a-e, which were then converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 10-14, respectively, by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation. The hydrogenation of 26f was carried out at several different conditions. The best result is that treatment of compound 26f with PtO 2 in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 4:1) at 50 atm gave the carbonyl group reduced intermediate 29 in 53% yield. Reduction of 29 using the similar procedure for the preparation of 27a-e gave the key intermediate 30 in 92% yield, which was converted into phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 15 by using the Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation ( Figure 3) . In order to further evaluate the effect of 6-hydroxy group on antiviral activity, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 16 and 17 were designed and synthesized. Phenanthrene-9-carboxylic acid 34 was synthesized by employing 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetic acid and 4hydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting materials ( Figure 4) . Ester 33 was obtained by the conventional four steps previously reported in the literature [29] . Then hydrolysis of ester 33 gave acid 34, which was treated with 2-lithiopyridine to afford the desired ketone 35. The catalytic hydrogenation of 35 to give 38 was carried out under two different procedures. Treatment of compound 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst in reluxing methanol at 1 atm gave the alcohol 36 in 83% yield. Reduction of 36 using the Et 3 SiH/TFA system afforded the desired product 37, which was further reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 5:1) at 10 atm gave 38 in 82% yield. For another method, treatment of ketone 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org in reluxing acetic acid at 1 atm gave the key intermediate 38 in 59% yield. Then amino and phenol protection and Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation proceeded sequentially to give 40, which deprotection afforded phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 16 in 69% yield ( Figure 4) . Treatment of pyridine 37 with cyclopropylmethyl bromide obtained 41, which was reduced using PtO 2 as the catalyst in ethanol and conc. HCl (v/v 20:1) at 50 atm to afford the key intermediate 42. The Pictet-Spengler cyclomethylenation of 42 gave phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 17 in 80% yield ( Figure 5 ). The phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were first tested for their phytotoxic activity against the test plant, and the results indicated that these natural product-based compounds showed no phytotoxic activity at 500 mg/mL. The commercial plant virucide Ningnanmycin, perhaps the most successful registered anti-plant viral agent, Ribavirin and (R)antofine were used as the controls. In order to investigate the subsituent effects of phenanthrene moiety, a series of racemic phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1, 4, 7, and 10-18 were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral activity (Table 1) . To our delight, all the racemic phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids displayed higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, of which cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin, thus emerged as novel potent lead compounds for anti-TMV agents. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. Cryptopleurine (1) exhibited significantly higher activity than alkaloid 7, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 7- Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Anti-TMV Agents PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org position of the phenanthrene moiety is beneficial for mataining excellent antiviral activity. Alkaloids 4 and 7 displayed about similar activity, which indicated that the removal of methoxyl at 2position of the phenanthrene moiety is tolerant. The 6-position of the phenanthrene moiety, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA [26] , really is a sensitive site: removal of 6-O methyl increased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 16.1; 18.2), which indicated that the 6-position may be a hydrogen donor site; replacement of 6-O methyl with 6-O cyclopropyl methyl significantly decreased the antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 1.17), which indicated that the steric effect is also a very important factor. Instead of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with methylenedioxyl is tolerant (antiviral activity: 7 < 10 < 11 < 12). However, replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with ethylenedioxyl significantly increased the anti-TMV activity, especially for 6,7-dimethoxyl (antiviral activity: 15.13.14.7). Further to investigated the effect of C 14a chirality on anti-TMV activity, a series of chiral phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 2 ). The (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids exhibited significantly higher activity than their enantiomers (antiviral activity: 2.3; 5.6; 8.9). The structure difference between (R)-cryptopleurine (2) and (R)-antofine lies in the ''E'' ring. (R)-Antofine with a 5-member ''E'' ring displayed inhibition activity of 42.7% inactivation effect, 46.0% curative effect and 45.5% protection effect at 500 mg/mL. However, (R)-cryptopleurine (2) with a 6-member ''E'' ring exhibited significantly higher in vivo antiviral activity than (R)-antofine even at 100 mg/mL. The results further indicated that although phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine are structure analogs, their biological properties are different [22] . For (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 2.8); removal of 2-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 5.6). However, the (S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids displayed about similar moderate antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 3 < 6 < 9). In order to investigated the effect of 15-hydroxyl on antiviral activity, a series of 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 19-24 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity ( Table 3 ). The bioassay results showed that the 15-hydroxyphenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids also displayed good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which alkaloids 19, 20, 22 and 24 exhibited signigicantly higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin, and alkaloids 19 and 22 displayed higher in vivo activity than Ningnanmycin at 100 mg/mL. The introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position significantly increased antiviral activity for (S)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 2.19; 5.21; 8.23), but decreased antiviral activity for (R)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (antiviral activity: 20.3; 22.6; 24.9). The (S,S)-enantiomers 22 and 24 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity than their corresponding enantiomers 21 and 23. However, the (S,S)-enantiomer 20 showed a lower activity than its enantiomer 19. For (14aS,15S)-phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids: removal of 7-methoxyl decreased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 20,24); removal of 2-methoxyl increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 22.24). For (14aR,15R)phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids, removal of 7-methoxyl or 2methoxyl all increased antiviral activity (antiviral activity: 19.21.23). Reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were used as received. All anhydrous solvent were dried and purified by standard techniques just before use.

The anti-TMV activity of the synthesized pure compounds was tested using our previously reported method [30] . Antiviral activity of compounds against TMV in vitro. Fresh leaf of the 5-6 growth stage of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) inoculated by the juice-leaf rubbing method (concentration of TMV is 5.88 6 10 -2 mg/mL) was cut into halves along the main vein. The halves were immersed into the solution of 500 mg/mL of the compounds and double distilled water for 20 min, respectively, and then cultured at 25uC for 72 h. Each compound was replicated at least three times. Protective effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The compound solution was smeared on the left side and the solvent serving as control on the right side of growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) leaves of the same ages. The leaves were then inoculated with the virus after 12 h. A brush was dipped in TMV of 6 6 10 23 mg/mL to inoculate the leaves, which were previously scattered with silicon carbide. The leaves were then washed with water and rubbed softly along the nervature once or twice. The local lesion numbers appearing 3-4 days after inoculation were counted. There are three replicates for each compound. Inactivation effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. The virus was inhibited by mixing with the compound solution at the same volume for 30 min. The mixture was then inoculated on the left side of the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc), whereas the right side of the leaves was inoculated with the mixture of solvent and the virus for control. The local lesion numbers were recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. Curative effect of compounds against TMV in vivo. Growing leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Xanthi nc) of the same ages were selected. TMV (concentration of 6.0 6 10 23 mg/mL) was dipped and inoculated on the whole leaves. Then the leaves were washed with water and dried. The compound solution was smeared on the left side, and the solvent was smeared on the right side for control. The local lesion numbers were then counted and recorded 3-4 days after inoculation. There are three replicates for each compound. The in vitro and in vivo inhibition rates of the compound were then calculated according to the following formula (''av'' means average, and controls were not treated with compound). Inhibition rate (%) = [(av local lesion no. of control 2 av local lesion no. of drug-treated)/av local lesion no. of control] 6 100%. In summary, based on the literature report and our previous work, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were designed, prepared and evaluated for their anti-TMV activity for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo antiviral bioassays showed that most of these alkaloids exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aRconfiguration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased antiviral activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Further studies on mode of action are currently underway in our laboratories.

         "Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Factors Determining Progression to Lower Respiratory Tract Disease",
         "Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≤100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of >1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression. Conclusions. Host and transplant related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.",

         "Infection caused by respiratory viruses is a threat for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause serious progressive disease in both allogeneic and autologous transplant recipients [1] [2] [3] with mortality as high as 20%-40% with current treatment interventions [4] . Although treatment options such as antiviral agents, steroids, and immunoglobulin are frequently used, there is no definitive treatment for RSV disease in the transplant population [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . RSV infection in HCT recipients can present as a self-limited upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or can progress to more severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRD), a condition associated with a high mortality or late airflow obstruction among survivors [11] . Because RSV LRD is a potentially life-threatening disease, identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe LRD is important. Lymphopenia has been identified as important risk factor for progression in several studies [1, 12, 13] , but the significance of other factors that could plausibly be associated with disease progression, including lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, viral subtypes, neutralizing antibody titers, lung function, and smoking history has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively determine the significance of host, viral, and treatment factors for the progression to RSV LRD in patients who presented with RSV URI. Patients who underwent allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous HCT at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Seattle Cancer Center Alliance in Seattle, Washington, from November 1988 to June 2011 were analyzed. Patients with respiratory symptoms had respiratory secretions analyzed for respiratory viruses according to institutional protocols and received standardized care for RSV disease [14] . Patients with RSV URI received high dose intermittently (6 g/day, 60 mg/mL for 2 hours every 8 hours) or low dose continuously (6 g/day, 20 mg/mL for 18 hours/day) ribavirin at the discretion of the attending physician, with or without immunoglobulin or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fusion protein of RSV, palivizumab. Use of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and palivizumab at the time of RSV infection was also analyzed. Steroids were given to patients with acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and IVIG was given mainly for GVHD prophylaxis and low immunoglobulin levels (maximum 500 mg/kg/week). After January 1993, routine IVIG administration was discontinued. Only patients who signed a consent allowing retrospective research (>95%) were included in the study, and the study was approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. Patients who developed respiratory tract illness due to confirmed RSV infection were considered to have RSV infection. Only patients who presented with RSV URI within 100 days post HCT were included for the analysis. RSV URI was defined as respiratory infection confined to the nose, throat, and sinuses as confirmed by detection of RSV without any evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. RSV LRD was defined as detection of RSV in the lower respiratory tract by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy in patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough, oxygen requirement, wheezing) or radiographic new infiltrates. Patients who had URI only were defined as nonprogressors and patients who had URI initially that subsequently progressed to LRD were defined as progressors. Patients who presented with RSV LRD concurrently with URI (defined as development of LRD within 2 days of RSV URI) were excluded. Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal wash/swab and BAL samples) were studied for viral antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining for RSV, influenza A, B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and adenovirus, human metapnuemovirus (since April 2007); conventional and shell vial centrifugation viral cultures were performed as a standard practice for all patients throughout the study period [6, 11] . After 2006, upper respiratory tract samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of conventional methods, whereas BAL samples were tested both by conventional methods and PCR [15] . Cultured RSV isolates were stored at −70°C. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the samples and tested for RSV RNA by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay as described elsewhere [16] . The RSV type specific assay contained one primer set to amplify a 94 bp region of the RSV polymerase gene from both types A and B, a 5′ 6FAMlabeled probe specific for RSV type A, and a 5′ VIC-labeled probe specific for RSV type B. Both probes were labeled on the 3′ end with MGBNFQ. We tested available sera from a prospectively collected serum repository (mostly collected from 1990s). Pretransplant sera from both donors and HCT recipients and weekly posttransplant sera close to URI event (within 2 weeks before and 1 week after) were analyzed. The sampled sera were stored at or below −20°C. Measurement of serum neutralizing-antibody titers to RSV was performed using an established microneutralization method for RSV A (MNA) and RSV B (MNB) strains in the laboratory of Dr Walsh at the University of Rochester [17, 18] . In brief, serum dilutions were incubated with 75 plaqueforming units (PFU) of RSV A2 strain (group A virus) or RSV B1 strain (group B virus) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1.5 × 10 4 HEp-2 cells in 96-well culture plates. After 3 days, the quantity of RSV antigen was determined by EIA using monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RSV F protein. The neutralization titer was defined as the serum dilution that results in a 50% reduction in color development. The probability of progression from upper to lower RSV infection was estimated using cumulative incidence. Death was treated as a competing risk for progression. Differences in the proportions of patients who progressed to LRD were evaluated for statistical significance with logistic regression models. The following variables were considered potential predictors of progression: patient age, sex, smoking status, donor type, cell source, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, year transplant performed, total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning, presence of acute GVHD, lymphocyte count at the time of RSV URI onset, pretransplant lung function, RSV subtype, time from transplant to RSV infection, ribavirin treatment, steroid treatment at varying doses, RSV antibody levels and weekly IVIG infusion. Grades 2-4 acute GVHD was considered present if it was diagnosed before or up to 2 days after the diagnosis of upper RSV infection. Patients who received an autologous or syngeneic transplant were categorized separately for analysis of acute GVHD as a risk factor for progression. The antibody levels were classified according to RSV subtype. All covariates with at least 90% complete data were candidates for the primary analysis via multiple logistic regression models. A variable was retained in the multivariable model if its univariate association with progression resulted in a P value ≤ .1. Ribavirin treatment was retained in all models because it was a predictor of interest. Covariates missing for more than 10% of the data were not included in the first round of multivariable modeling, but were subsequently examined in subsets of patients with available data. The statistical significance of differences in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) between the times of URI onset and LRD onset for progressors, and the times of URI onset and 7 days later for nonprogressors, was evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. These differences in ALC values and the slopes (change in ALC/days between URI and LRD or 7) were then compared by progression status via t-test. Reported P values are 2-sided and based on the Wald statistic. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). One hundred eighty-one patients including 147 allogeneic and 34 autologous HCT recipients were evaluated (Table 1) . Two patients received syngeneic transplants, and 7 patients were treated with tandem transplants (autologous HCT prior to allogeneic HCT, classified as allogeneic for analysis). The median age was 40.0 years (range, 0.3-72.8 years). The age distribution is as follows: 6 patients were younger than 2 years of age, 20 were 2-14 years, 15 were 15-24 years, 89 were 25-49 years, and 51 were 50 year old or older. One hundred fifty-three patients were white (85%). Eighty one recipients (45%) were CMV negative, and 82 donors (45%) were CMV negative. Among the 181 patients studied, 138 patients (76%) had URI only (nonprogressors) and 43 patients (24%) had URI initially and then progressed to LRD ( progressors). RSV URI occurred at median post-transplant day 49 (range 1-100). The cumulative incidence of progression at day 40 post-URI diagnosis was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-30%, Figure 1A ). Progression to LRD occurred in 36 allogeneic HCT recipients (24%) and in 7 autologous recipients (21%). Progression to LRD occurred at a median of 7 days after RSV URI onset (range, 2-38 days). There were no progression in the 6 patients who were <2 years old. RSV isolates from 76 patients were available for additional virus culture and subtyping by RT-PCR (49 with stable URI and 27 with progression to LRD; Table 1 ). For RSV subtype specific antibodies measurement, sera from 36 donors and 40 recipients pretransplant were available. Sera taken near the time of onset of RSV URI from 38 recipients posttransplant were also tested (25 with stable URI and 13 with progression to LRD). In a univariate model (Table 1) , smoking status, transplant year, high TBI dose, conditioning regimen, lymphocyte count at URI onset, and time of URI onset were sufficiently predictive of progression to LRD to qualify for the multivariable model. In a multivariable model ( Table 2 , left side), including 175 patients with 41 progressors, positive smoking status, TBI of 1200 cGy or more, and a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset were significant risk factors for progression to LRD. Of note, treatment with high-dose ribavirin did not reach statistical significance when included in the model. To determine if risk factors were different when considering only LRD events confirmed by radiographic infiltrates, an additional model was fit (Table 2 , right side). In that subgroup of 31 patients who progressed to radiographically proven LRD, only a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset remained a significant risk factor for progression to LRD. The probability of progression to LRD from RSV URI by lymphocyte counts at URI onset is shown in Figure 1B . To determine whether the high-dose ribavirin treatment effect varied based on baseline lymphocyte count we performed a stratified analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B) . There appeared to be stronger trend towards a treatment effect in the low lymphocyte strata (total lymphocyte count <300/mm 3 ), but neither result reached statistical significance. We also fit multivariable models to examine the effect of corticosteroid dose at the time of URI diagnosis. When we adjusted for lymphocyte count, smoking status, high-dose ribavirin and TBI, steroid dose was not associated with progression to LRD (data not shown). Because the stored RSV culture isolates were further subtyped by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 76 patients, we could identify each RSV infection episode by RSV subtypes (36 patients with subtype A and 40 patients with subtype B; Table 1 ). RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progression in univariate analysis (Table 1) . RSV subtypespecific neutralizing antibody (RSV A vs RSV B) levels were examined in donors and in recipients, pretransplant, and posttransplant close to the time of RSV URI, and none of these showed a statistically significant association with progression (Table 3) . Similarly, weekly IVIG infusion did not impact risk of progression (Table 1) . The effect of immune reconstitution on progression was examined in 43 progressors and 138 nonprogressors by comparing changes in ALC over time. In progressors, ALC at URI onset and LRD onset were compared. Because the median time for progression from URI to LRD was 7 days, the ALC at the time of URI onset and 7 days later were compared in nonprogressors. In the progressors, the median ALC at URI and LRD onset were 140/mm 3 and 198/mm 3 , respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A ). In nonprogressors, the median ALC at URI onset and URI 7 days were 400/mm 3 and 453/mm 3 (Supplementary Figure 2B ). The median (range) change in ALCs in progressors vs nonprogressors were −6/mm 3 (−410 to 780/mm 3 ) and 29/mm 3 (−3854 to 2070/mm 3 ), respectively (Figure 2A) . ALC changes as a rate per day were also examined by calculating the slopes of ALC changes as (ALC at LRD onset-ALC at URI onset) divided by days between URI and LRD in progressors, and (ALC at URI d7-ALC at URI onset) divided by 7 in nonprogressors. The median (range) slopes in progressors vs nonprogressors were −2/mm 3 day −1 (−48 to 220/mm 3 day −1 ) vs 4/mm 3 day −1 (−551 to 296/mm 3 day −1 ) ( Figure 2B ). There were no significant differences between the groups in change in ALC (P = .52) or slope of ALC (P = .96). [19] . RSV disease progression is not universal, with observed rates of progression ranging from 0% up to 60% (mean 38%) [10, 20, 21] . The identification of risk factors associated with progression and assessment of potential treatment modalities are important when caring for these patients. This study was designed to determine the significance of viral subtype, type-specific neutralizing antibodies and other previously untested factors that could be associated with progression to lower respiratory tract disease. We found that smoking, conditioning with high-dose TBI, and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with progression (Table 2) , whereas the viral subtype, RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies, lung function, and lymphocyte engraftment dynamics appeared similar between progressors and nonprogressors (Table 1 and 3 and Figure 2A and 2B). To date, lymphopenia is the only established risk factor for progression of RSV URI to LRD in HCT recipients. We validated this association in statistical models that adjusted for other important risk factors and defined, for the first time to our knowledge, a protective level of the ALC. In our study, we determined that lymphocyte counts >1000/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were associated with complete protection from disease progression. Although absolute levels of lymphocytes appeared to be extremely predictive for subsequent LRD, lymphocyte engraftment dynamics had no apparent effect. A potential role of lymphocytes in immune reconstitution has been suspected as risk factor for RSV LRD development because severe RSV disease is known to occur more frequently if infection occurs before engraftment [22] . Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known phenomenon observed as clinical deterioration in the setting of infection in the face of immune restoration by antiretroviral therapy in certain individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23] [24] [25] . IRIS has also been reported in non-HIV settings such as HCT, solid organ transplant recipients, autoimmune diseases, or cancer therapy with multiple pathogens [26, 27] . The existence of the immune reconstitution phenomenon in the context of RSV disease progression in HCT recipients has not been systematically analyzed. Because lymphocyte counts were found to be the critical risk factor for progression, we examined the effect of lymphocyte count changes on progression from URI to LRD to test whether progression to LRD was associated with increasing lymphocyte counts and thus a form of IRIS. The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28] . However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B) , suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD. RSV-specific antibodies play an important role in the prevention of RSV disease in young children [29, 30] . Palivizumab prophylaxis has been documented to prevent serious RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [31] but has shown only very limited success in treatment situations [6, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log 2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36] . A recent retrospective pooled review on management of RSV infections in adult recipients of HCT showed that treatment interventions (such as aerosolized ribavirin alone or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin, RSV specific immunoglobulin, or palivizumab) reduced the progression by almost one-third compared to no treatment [20] . Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URI did not show a beneficial effect [8, 10] . Overall, the importance of serum RSV-Ab level in protecting the HCT patient from RSV disease progression is not known, and there is presently no good evidence supporting its use in patients with RSV URI [37] . Based on the above data, we hypothesized that differences in RSV antibody level would influence the progression outcome during RSV infection. The effect of preexisting RSV antibody level in donors and recipients before HCT and posttransplant period near the time when RSV infection occurred was examined. Our analyses did not show any role of preexisting antibody levels in the progression of RSV disease from upper to lower tract infection (Table 3) . Although we did not observe differences in antibody levels between progressors and nonprogressors, this study is the first to our knowledge to measure the RSV A and B subtype specific antibody level in HCT recipients and their donors. Optimal RSV-specific antibody levels in HCT recipients or donors for the prevention of progression in HCT recipients are not known, but these data will provide reference for future studies. Differences in RSV disease severity based on subtypes A and B have been suggested in children with primary infection in the literature [38] . RSV A and B typically cocirculate in the community, and both types are also detected in immunocompromised populations [16, 39, 40] . We correlated RSV subtypes with disease progression in our subjects, demonstrating that RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progressive disease (Table 1 ). Although we were only able to perform this analysis in a relatively small subset of patients, we were unable to detect any trends. Therefore, if an effect of subtype on disease progression is present, it is likely to be small. Active smoking before HCT was a risk factor for progression in this study. This is a novel observation for the immunocompromised patient population and a potentially modifiable factor. Household smoke has long been identified as a risk for RSV bronchiolitis in the pediatric population [41, 42] but has not been studied systematically in immunocompromised adult populations. We also examined the role of steroid treatment at varying doses, presence of varying degrees of GVHD, time from transplantation to RSV infection, and other transplant and host factors but found no statistically significant associations. The lack of association with steroid dose is important in clinical practice. Physicians often wonder whether small doses of steroids can be given to ease obstructive patterns or if a rapid taper should be initiated if patients are already receiving steroids (mostly for GVHD). Although this was not a randomized trial, our data would suggest that moderate doses of systemic corticosteroids may not be associated with progression to LRD. This study did not find a statistically significant effect of high-dose ribavirin when given for RSV URI. However, the number of patients treated was relatively small, and the trend was consistent with other reports in the literature [43] [44] [45] . Preemptive aerosolized ribavirin has not been evaluated in adequately powered randomized controlled trials in immunocompromised patients, although recent analyses suggested a beneficial effect [2, 20] . In addition, there are a few case series studies reporting the effect of oral or intravenous ribavirin treatment, which needs further evaluation [46, 47] Our study has several strengths and limitations. Although we included clinical data from a large number of patients who initially presented with RSV URI, sera for RSV specific antibody test were available only in a subset of recipients and donors (less than half), and RSV virus subtype was also only available in 76 patients. Therefore, smaller effect sizes associated with RSV subtypes or RSV-specific antibody levels may have been missed. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine RSV subtype-specific antibody levels in HCT recipients with concurrent virus subtyping. In addition, this study examined the effect of immune reconstitution, although only by analyzing overall lymphocyte engraftment dynamics. We were unable to evaluate the effects of specific T-cell subsets because these data were not available, and there were no cells available for study. In conclusion, among 181 HCT recipients who presented with RSV URI, we identified smoking, conditioning with highdose TBI (1200-1575 cGy), and ALC of ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset as significant risk factors associated with progression. We also observed that ALC of >1000/mm 3 was completely protective against RSV disease progression. The importance of lymphocyte counts and the lack C of importance of antibody levels suggest that a characterization of RSV-specific cellmediated immunity is warranted.

         "Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Factors Determining Progression to Lower Respiratory Tract Disease. Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≤100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of >1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression. Conclusions. Host and transplant related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.. Infection caused by respiratory viruses is a threat for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause serious progressive disease in both allogeneic and autologous transplant recipients [1] [2] [3] with mortality as high as 20%-40% with current treatment interventions [4] . Although treatment options such as antiviral agents, steroids, and immunoglobulin are frequently used, there is no definitive treatment for RSV disease in the transplant population [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . RSV infection in HCT recipients can present as a self-limited upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or can progress to more severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRD), a condition associated with a high mortality or late airflow obstruction among survivors [11] . Because RSV LRD is a potentially life-threatening disease, identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe LRD is important. Lymphopenia has been identified as important risk factor for progression in several studies [1, 12, 13] , but the significance of other factors that could plausibly be associated with disease progression, including lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, viral subtypes, neutralizing antibody titers, lung function, and smoking history has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively determine the significance of host, viral, and treatment factors for the progression to RSV LRD in patients who presented with RSV URI. Patients who underwent allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous HCT at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Seattle Cancer Center Alliance in Seattle, Washington, from November 1988 to June 2011 were analyzed. Patients with respiratory symptoms had respiratory secretions analyzed for respiratory viruses according to institutional protocols and received standardized care for RSV disease [14] . Patients with RSV URI received high dose intermittently (6 g/day, 60 mg/mL for 2 hours every 8 hours) or low dose continuously (6 g/day, 20 mg/mL for 18 hours/day) ribavirin at the discretion of the attending physician, with or without immunoglobulin or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fusion protein of RSV, palivizumab. Use of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and palivizumab at the time of RSV infection was also analyzed. Steroids were given to patients with acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and IVIG was given mainly for GVHD prophylaxis and low immunoglobulin levels (maximum 500 mg/kg/week). After January 1993, routine IVIG administration was discontinued. Only patients who signed a consent allowing retrospective research (>95%) were included in the study, and the study was approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. Patients who developed respiratory tract illness due to confirmed RSV infection were considered to have RSV infection. Only patients who presented with RSV URI within 100 days post HCT were included for the analysis. RSV URI was defined as respiratory infection confined to the nose, throat, and sinuses as confirmed by detection of RSV without any evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. RSV LRD was defined as detection of RSV in the lower respiratory tract by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy in patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough, oxygen requirement, wheezing) or radiographic new infiltrates. Patients who had URI only were defined as nonprogressors and patients who had URI initially that subsequently progressed to LRD were defined as progressors. Patients who presented with RSV LRD concurrently with URI (defined as development of LRD within 2 days of RSV URI) were excluded. Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal wash/swab and BAL samples) were studied for viral antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining for RSV, influenza A, B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and adenovirus, human metapnuemovirus (since April 2007); conventional and shell vial centrifugation viral cultures were performed as a standard practice for all patients throughout the study period [6, 11] . After 2006, upper respiratory tract samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of conventional methods, whereas BAL samples were tested both by conventional methods and PCR [15] . Cultured RSV isolates were stored at −70°C. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the samples and tested for RSV RNA by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay as described elsewhere [16] . The RSV type specific assay contained one primer set to amplify a 94 bp region of the RSV polymerase gene from both types A and B, a 5′ 6FAMlabeled probe specific for RSV type A, and a 5′ VIC-labeled probe specific for RSV type B. Both probes were labeled on the 3′ end with MGBNFQ. We tested available sera from a prospectively collected serum repository (mostly collected from 1990s). Pretransplant sera from both donors and HCT recipients and weekly posttransplant sera close to URI event (within 2 weeks before and 1 week after) were analyzed. The sampled sera were stored at or below −20°C. Measurement of serum neutralizing-antibody titers to RSV was performed using an established microneutralization method for RSV A (MNA) and RSV B (MNB) strains in the laboratory of Dr Walsh at the University of Rochester [17, 18] . In brief, serum dilutions were incubated with 75 plaqueforming units (PFU) of RSV A2 strain (group A virus) or RSV B1 strain (group B virus) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1.5 × 10 4 HEp-2 cells in 96-well culture plates. After 3 days, the quantity of RSV antigen was determined by EIA using monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RSV F protein. The neutralization titer was defined as the serum dilution that results in a 50% reduction in color development. The probability of progression from upper to lower RSV infection was estimated using cumulative incidence. Death was treated as a competing risk for progression. Differences in the proportions of patients who progressed to LRD were evaluated for statistical significance with logistic regression models. The following variables were considered potential predictors of progression: patient age, sex, smoking status, donor type, cell source, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, year transplant performed, total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning, presence of acute GVHD, lymphocyte count at the time of RSV URI onset, pretransplant lung function, RSV subtype, time from transplant to RSV infection, ribavirin treatment, steroid treatment at varying doses, RSV antibody levels and weekly IVIG infusion. Grades 2-4 acute GVHD was considered present if it was diagnosed before or up to 2 days after the diagnosis of upper RSV infection. Patients who received an autologous or syngeneic transplant were categorized separately for analysis of acute GVHD as a risk factor for progression. The antibody levels were classified according to RSV subtype. All covariates with at least 90% complete data were candidates for the primary analysis via multiple logistic regression models. A variable was retained in the multivariable model if its univariate association with progression resulted in a P value ≤ .1. Ribavirin treatment was retained in all models because it was a predictor of interest. Covariates missing for more than 10% of the data were not included in the first round of multivariable modeling, but were subsequently examined in subsets of patients with available data. The statistical significance of differences in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) between the times of URI onset and LRD onset for progressors, and the times of URI onset and 7 days later for nonprogressors, was evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. These differences in ALC values and the slopes (change in ALC/days between URI and LRD or 7) were then compared by progression status via t-test. Reported P values are 2-sided and based on the Wald statistic. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). One hundred eighty-one patients including 147 allogeneic and 34 autologous HCT recipients were evaluated (Table 1) . Two patients received syngeneic transplants, and 7 patients were treated with tandem transplants (autologous HCT prior to allogeneic HCT, classified as allogeneic for analysis). The median age was 40.0 years (range, 0.3-72.8 years). The age distribution is as follows: 6 patients were younger than 2 years of age, 20 were 2-14 years, 15 were 15-24 years, 89 were 25-49 years, and 51 were 50 year old or older. One hundred fifty-three patients were white (85%). Eighty one recipients (45%) were CMV negative, and 82 donors (45%) were CMV negative. Among the 181 patients studied, 138 patients (76%) had URI only (nonprogressors) and 43 patients (24%) had URI initially and then progressed to LRD ( progressors). RSV URI occurred at median post-transplant day 49 (range 1-100). The cumulative incidence of progression at day 40 post-URI diagnosis was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-30%, Figure 1A ). Progression to LRD occurred in 36 allogeneic HCT recipients (24%) and in 7 autologous recipients (21%). Progression to LRD occurred at a median of 7 days after RSV URI onset (range, 2-38 days). There were no progression in the 6 patients who were <2 years old. RSV isolates from 76 patients were available for additional virus culture and subtyping by RT-PCR (49 with stable URI and 27 with progression to LRD; Table 1 ). For RSV subtype specific antibodies measurement, sera from 36 donors and 40 recipients pretransplant were available. Sera taken near the time of onset of RSV URI from 38 recipients posttransplant were also tested (25 with stable URI and 13 with progression to LRD). In a univariate model (Table 1) , smoking status, transplant year, high TBI dose, conditioning regimen, lymphocyte count at URI onset, and time of URI onset were sufficiently predictive of progression to LRD to qualify for the multivariable model. In a multivariable model ( Table 2 , left side), including 175 patients with 41 progressors, positive smoking status, TBI of 1200 cGy or more, and a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset were significant risk factors for progression to LRD. Of note, treatment with high-dose ribavirin did not reach statistical significance when included in the model. To determine if risk factors were different when considering only LRD events confirmed by radiographic infiltrates, an additional model was fit (Table 2 , right side). In that subgroup of 31 patients who progressed to radiographically proven LRD, only a lymphocyte count of 100/mm 3 or less at the time of RSV URI onset remained a significant risk factor for progression to LRD. The probability of progression to LRD from RSV URI by lymphocyte counts at URI onset is shown in Figure 1B . To determine whether the high-dose ribavirin treatment effect varied based on baseline lymphocyte count we performed a stratified analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B) . There appeared to be stronger trend towards a treatment effect in the low lymphocyte strata (total lymphocyte count <300/mm 3 ), but neither result reached statistical significance. We also fit multivariable models to examine the effect of corticosteroid dose at the time of URI diagnosis. When we adjusted for lymphocyte count, smoking status, high-dose ribavirin and TBI, steroid dose was not associated with progression to LRD (data not shown). Because the stored RSV culture isolates were further subtyped by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 76 patients, we could identify each RSV infection episode by RSV subtypes (36 patients with subtype A and 40 patients with subtype B; Table 1 ). RSV subtype was not significantly associated with progression in univariate analysis (Table 1) . RSV subtypespecific neutralizing antibody (RSV A vs RSV B) levels were examined in donors and in recipients, pretransplant, and posttransplant close to the time of RSV URI, and none of these showed a statistically significant association with progression (Table 3) . Similarly, weekly IVIG infusion did not impact risk of progression (Table 1) . The effect of immune reconstitution on progression was examined in 43 progressors and 138 nonprogressors by comparing changes in ALC over time. In progressors, ALC at URI onset and LRD onset were compared. Because the median time for progression from URI to LRD was 7 days, the ALC at the time of URI onset and 7 days later were compared in nonprogressors. In the progressors, the median ALC at URI and LRD onset were 140/mm 3 and 198/mm 3 , respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A ). In nonprogressors, the median ALC at URI onset and URI 7 days were 400/mm 3 and 453/mm 3 (Supplementary Figure 2B ). The median (range) change in ALCs in progressors vs nonprogressors were −6/mm 3 (−410 to 780/mm 3 ) and 29/mm 3 (−3854 to 2070/mm 3 ), respectively (Figure 2A) . ALC changes as a rate per day were also examined by calculating the slopes of ALC changes as (ALC at LRD onset-ALC at URI onset) divided by days between URI and LRD in progressors, and (ALC at URI d7-ALC at URI onset) divided by 7 in nonprogressors. The median (range) slopes in progressors vs nonprogressors were −2/mm 3 day −1 (−48 to 220/mm 3 day −1 ) vs 4/mm 3 day −1 (−551 to 296/mm 3 day −1 ) ( Figure 2B ). There were no significant differences between the groups in change in ALC (P = .52) or slope of ALC (P = .96). [19] . RSV disease progression is not universal, with observed rates of progression ranging from 0% up to 60% (mean 38%) [10, 20, 21] . The identification of risk factors associated with progression and assessment of potential treatment modalities are important when caring for these patients. This study was designed to determine the significance of viral subtype, type-specific neutralizing antibodies and other previously untested factors that could be associated with progression to lower respiratory tract disease. We found that smoking, conditioning with high-dose TBI, and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) ≤100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with progression (Table 2) , whereas the viral subtype, RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies, lung function, and lymphocyte engraftment dynamics appeared similar between progressors and nonprogressors (Table 1 and 3 and Figure 2A and 2B). To date, lymphopenia is the only established risk factor for progression of RSV URI to LRD in HCT recipients. We validated this association in statistical models that adjusted for other important risk factors and defined, for the first time to our knowledge, a protective level of the ALC. In our study, we determined that lymphocyte counts >1000/mm 3 at the time of URI onset were associated with complete protection from disease progression. Although absolute levels of lymphocytes appeared to be extremely predictive for subsequent LRD, lymphocyte engraftment dynamics had no apparent effect. A potential role of lymphocytes in immune reconstitution has been suspected as risk factor for RSV LRD development because severe RSV disease is known to occur more frequently if infection occurs before engraftment [22] . Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known phenomenon observed as clinical deterioration in the setting of infection in the face of immune restoration by antiretroviral therapy in certain individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23] [24] [25] . IRIS has also been reported in non-HIV settings such as HCT, solid organ transplant recipients, autoimmune diseases, or cancer therapy with multiple pathogens [26, 27] . The existence of the immune reconstitution phenomenon in the context of RSV disease progression in HCT recipients has not been systematically analyzed. Because lymphocyte counts were found to be the critical risk factor for progression, we examined the effect of lymphocyte count changes on progression from URI to LRD to test whether progression to LRD was associated with increasing lymphocyte counts and thus a form of IRIS. The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28] . However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B) , suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD. RSV-specific antibodies play an important role in the prevention of RSV disease in young children [29, 30] . Palivizumab prophylaxis has been documented to prevent serious RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [31] but has shown only very limited success in treatment situations [6, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log 2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36] . A recent retrospective pooled review on management of RSV infections in adult recipients of HCT showed that treatment interventions (such as aerosolized ribavirin alone or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin, RSV specific immunoglobulin, or palivizumab) reduced the progression by almost one-third compared to no treatment [20] . Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URI did not show a beneficial effect [8, 10] . Overall, the importance of serum RSV-Ab level in protecting the HCT patient from RSV disease progression is not known, and there is presently no good evidence supporting its use in patients with RSV URI [37] . Based on the above data, we hypothesized that differences in RSV antibody level would influence the progression outcome during RSV infection.

         "Circulating Levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptor 2 Are Increased in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Relative to Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction: Evidence for a Divergence in Pathophysiology",
         "BACKGROUND: Various pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) axis in community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNFα, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNFα cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNFα and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both controls and HFREF. TNFα, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of symptoms in HFPEF. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation mediated through TNFα and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, may represent an important component of a comorbidity-induced inflammatory response that partially drives the pathophysiology of HFPEF.",

         "Heart failure (HF) continues to have a significant clinical burden with a high mortality and morbidity, and has a worse one-year prognosis than cancer [1] . There are several classification schemes in HF; however, a common clinical approach involves classifying ambulatory patients with chronic HF into HF with preserved ($ 50%) or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (,50%; HFPEF or HFREF, respectively) [1, 2] . HFPEF presently accounts for approximately 40% of HF diagnoses, with a rising incidence, and mortality and morbidity comparable to HFREF [3] [4] [5] . Despite similarities in outcomes, it appears that HFPEF and HFREF represent distinct groups, with many pathophysiological differences, along the continuum of the HF [6] . Indeed, differential responses to therapeutic interventions between these two groups strongly support this concept. Clinical trials have validated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin IIreceptor blockers (ARB), beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) as therapeutics in HFREF [1] . Conversely, trials of ACEi, ARB, beta-blockers, MRA and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor failed to show any consistent and significant improvement in the clinical outcomes of patients with HFPEF. Biomarker studies have differentially implicated various pathways in HF, including fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodeling, oxidative and cardiomyocyte stress, and inflammation [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A recent report showed that circulating tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFa) receptor 1 (TNFR1) levels are significant predictors of incident HF, in particular for HFPEF versus HFREF [13] . Circulating TNFa and its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) are elevated in patients with heart failure relative to controls [6, 14] . The study presented herein expands on previous work by exploring associations between diastolic dysfunction or heart failure severity, and plasma levels of TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2, as well as a non-TNFa family cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in community-based cohorts of healthy controls, and ambulatory HFPEF and HFREF patients. Using well-defined HF cohorts, we set out to elucidate some elements of the mechanisms that drive HFPEF and HFREF. Our novel findings suggest that elevated plasma levels of TNFa receptors, in particular TNFR2, are more closely linked to the pathophysiology of HFPEF than HFREF. This study conforms with the conventions outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, it received internal ethics board approval at the Universities of Alberta and Calgary for use of human subjects, and all subjects gave written informed consent [15] . As part of a prospective clinical study, the Alberta HEART (Heart Failure Etiology and Analysis Research Team) project, community-based, ambulatory patients with clinical diagnoses of HF and healthy age-and gender-matched controls (n = 50) were consecutively recruited for comprehensive clinical, echocardiographic and biomarker analyses during a three-year period beginning in 2010 through the end of 2012. Blood pressure was recorded sitting or recumbent, and detailed clinical data were compiled at the time of enrollment. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed using the Phillips IE33 ultrasound platform. Echocardiograms were interpreted by cardiologists with specialized echocardiography training who were blinded to both the clinical classification and biomarker analyses. LVEF was assessed using Simpson's biplane method of disks. HF patients were adjudicated as HFREF (n = 100) or HFPEF (n = 100) using an LVEF cutoff of 50%, according to clinical practice guidelines [1, 2] . Adjudication of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and primary etiology of HF were determined by cardiologists blinded to biomarker analyses. Grading of diastolic dysfunction was performed by blinded members of the authorship team based on previously published guidelines [16] . LA volume index, lateral e' and medial e' were used as a binary classifier for diastolic dysfunction, after which E/A ratio, or average E/e' ratio, for patients in AFib, was used to ascertain grade in those determined to have diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction analyses could not be performed due to poor echocardiographic visualization in 9 HFPEF patients and 14 HFREF patients, and a further 1 HFPEF patient and 7 HFREF patients were excluded from diastolic function analyses due to the presence of severe mitral regurgitation (MR). BNP levels were assessed as previously described using an Alere Triage reagent pack (Alere Inc., Ottawa, ON, CAN) read in an automated DxI 800 immunoanalyzer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) at provincial heath laboratories in the province of Alberta [17] . Serum levels of creatinine and lipid profiles were available in study subjects' health records as part of their clinical evaluation. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls were as follows: no history of cardiovascular or renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, or atrial fibrillation; and no prescriptions for antiarrhythmics; ACEi; ARB; beta-blockers; digoxin; loop or thiazide diuretics; or MRA. Exclusion criteria for all study groups were any of the following: age less than 18 years; known malignancy, with expected survival time less than one year; pregnancy within the previous six months; recent cardiac event, including acute MI and decompensated HF; moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension; or severe mitral or aortic valvular stenosis. Blood for plasma analysis was collected during a one-day baseline enrolment which included the acquisition of the echocardiograms and ECGs. Patients were rested and sitting while blood was collected into cooled lithium-heparin tubes, which were immediately placed on ice prior to plasma fractionation and deep freezing at #275uC. Commercially-available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for TNF-a, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 (catalogue no. 's STA00C, SRT100, SRT200 and S6050, respectively, R&D Systems, MN, USA) were used as previously described [18, 19] . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with the wavelength correction set to 540 nm for all assays using a SpectraMax M5 Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Detection rates for the ELISAs were 72.4%, 100%, 100% and 81.2%, respectively. The inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 13.1% and 9.5% (n = 4); 7.0% and 5.2% (n = 4); 5.3% and 3.5% (n = 4); and 8.0% and 6.3% (n = 4), respectively. Plasma ACE2 activity was measured using a previously established immunofluorescence protocol [20] . Lithium heparin anti-coagulated platelet-free plasma samples were diluted to a final ratio of 30:70 in plasma assay buffer: 1 M NaCl (Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA), 75 mM Tris-HCl (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and 5 mM ZnCl 2 (Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA) at pH 6.5. Assay buffer was made to contain various protease inhibitors: 10 mM captopril (ACE inhibitor; Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA); 5 mM amastatin (aminopeptidase inhibitor; Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA); and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA) dissolved to achieve a concentration of 10 mM bestatin (aminopeptidase inhibitor), 1 mM E-64 [N-(trans-Epoxysuccinyl)-L-leucine-4-guanidinobutylamide; cysteine protease inhibitor], 770 nM pepstatin A (aspartyl protease inhibitor), 154 mM AEBSF [4-(20aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; serine protease inhibitor], 75 nM phosphoramidon (neprilysin inhibitor), 15 nM aprotinin (serine protease inhibitor) and 75 nM leupeptin (cysteine, serine and threonine proteases inhibitor). The use of protease inhibitors in the buffer solution was meant to ensure that the fluorogenic substrate and specific ACE2 inhibitor (both described below), which are integral to the assay, were not cleaved by other proteases naturally present in human plasma. Samples were incubated with Dnp-quenched Mca-containing fluorogenic substrate (catalogue no. ES007, R&D Systems, MN, USA) at a final concentration of 10 mM at 37uC. To find the fluorescence increase due to ACE2 activity, plasma samples were assayed both in the presence and absence of the specific linear ACE2 inhibitor, DX600 (catalogue no. 002-26, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, CA, USA). Fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission settings at 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively, using SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The maximal fluorescence increase due to ACE2 activity was determined from the maximum fluorescence difference between inhibited and uninhibited aliquots; this was normalized to a standard curve for Mca-containing fluorescent peptide (catalogue no. M-1975, Bachem, CA, USA) and scaled for time of measurement and plasma volume over 24 hours, with 1 hour as the baseline. All ACE2 enzymatic activity values herein are expressed in pmol/hr/mL, which describes the amount of substrate turned over per unit time per unit volume of plasma. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 10.2% and 7.5% (n = 10), respectively. Continuous data in tables are expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR) in parentheses. Continuous data in figures are expressed as box and whisker plots on a logarithmic scale to account for non-normal distributions, where boxes represent IQR with median as a bisecting line, while whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values. Categorical data are expressed as percentages. All categorical data were compared using Pearson Chi-square tests, while continuous variables analyzed by category were compared using Mann-Whitney U Test or Kruskal-Wallis Test with Mann-Whitney U Test for pairwise comparisons, where appropriate. Associations between categorical factors or continuous covariates and circulating inflammatory markers were tested using binary logistic or linear regression analyses, respectively, with log-transformed inflammatory marker levels to account for non-normal distributions. Associations between increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction or NYHA functional class and plasma biomarkers were tested using ordinal logistic regression analyses with log-transformed inflammatory marker levels. Forest plots are used to graphically display results from logistic regression analyses. A p-value,0.05 was considered significant for all statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics Version 20 (IBM, NY, USA). Obesity was defined as BMI$30 kg/m 2 per WHO criteria [21] . Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the revised four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation [22] . Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as left-ventricular mass index (LVMI) $115 g/m 2 for males and $ 95 g/m 2 for females per previously published criteria [23] . Demographic and clinical information for the control, HFPEF and HFREF groups is displayed in Table 1 . In this study, the HF patient populations recapitulated observations in previous reports [3] [4] [5] 24] . The study subjects were predominantly of white race in all study groups (Table 1) . HFPEF patients were older (p = 0.003), and significantly more were obese (p = 0.016) and hypertensive than HFREF patients, while neither HF group had different gender ratios (p = 0.210), histories of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.234) or atrial fibrillation (AFib; Table 1 ). Interestingly, total cholesterol (p = 0.774), triglycerides (p = 0.656) and total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (p = 0.187) were not significantly different between HF phenotypes, despite differences in obesity prevalence (Table 1) . Ischemic etiology was more prevalent in HFREF than HFPEF, but both groups were on evidence-based therapeutic regimens (Table 1 ). Importantly, drugs that can affect inflammation were comparably used by the two HF groups: NSAID use was equivalent and statin use was not significantly different (p = 0.438; Table 1 ). NYHA functional class distribution was also not significantly different between the HFPEF and HFREF groups (Table 1) . Heart rates did not differ significantly between controls or the two HF groups; however, a significantly greater number of HFPEF patients were in AFib on the day of study than HFREF patients (p = 0.018; Table 2 ). The HFREF group had significantly lower LVEF compared to control and HFPEF groups, while both HFPEF and HFREF had greater LV posterior wall thickness (LVPW; p,0.001 for both) and mass index (LVMI; p,0.001 for both); left atrial volume index (LA volume index; p,0.001 for both); and average E/e' ratio (p,0.001 for both) compared to control (Table 2) . LVPW (p,0.05), and left ventricular end diastolic and systolic dimensions (LVEDD and LVESD, respectively; p,0.001 for both) were significantly different between the two HF groups ( Table 2 ). The distributions of grades of diastolic dysfunction were also significantly different (p = 0.043), which might be due to the high prevalence of AFib acting as a confounder in this analysis ( Table 2) . Significantly more HFREF subjects had left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than HFPEF subjects (p,0.001; Table 2 ). Circulating inflammatory markers in healthy control, HFPEF and HFREF Compared to control, plasma levels of TNFa were only significantly elevated in HPFEF, while levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were significantly elevated in both HFPEF and HFREF ( Figure 1A-C) . Meanwhile, IL-6 was not significantly different between control and the HF groups ( Figure 1D ). Interestingly, TNFR2 was significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to HFREF, while TNFa and TNFR1 were non-significantly elevated in HFPEF ( Figure 1A-C) . We explored the relationship between age, eGFR, sex, obesity, LVH, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation with TNFa, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 in the combined HF group (Table 3) . Advanced age was significantly associated with elevated TNFR1 and TNFR2, and low eGFR was significantly associated with elevated TNFa in addition to its two receptors (Table 3) . TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 increased differentially in response to smoking status or comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, but were always associated with at least two covariates, while IL-6 was not associated with any covariate (Table 3) . Sex, obesity and LVH were not significantly associated with any of the inflammatory markers ( Table 3) . We investigated how the inflammatory markers in this study related to two clinically-relevant and commonly-used ordinal quantifications of disease status in HF: grade of diastolic dysfunction and NYHA functional class. We investigated these associations using ordinal logistic regression analyses. Elevated TNFR2 was significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF, while TNFR1 was not associated with diastolic dysfunction in either HF group ( Figure 2A) . Interestingly, elevated TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA functional class in both HPFEF and HFREF (Figure 2A ). Neither TNFa, nor IL-6 were significantly associated with diastolic dysfunction or symptom severity in either HFPEF or HFREF (data not shown). LA volume index was not associated with plasma TNFR1 or TNFR2 levels in HFPEF (r = 0.110, p = 0.298; and r = 0.170, p = 0.105, respectively) or HFREF (r = 0.083, p = 0.443; and r = 0.056, p = 0.607, respectively). Plasma levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were weakly, but significantly, associated with average E/ e' ratio in HFPEF ( Figure 2B & C) , but not HFREF (r = 0.215, p = 0.053; and r = 0.112, p = 0.318, respectively). Given that AFib can confound diastolic dysfunction analyses, we investigated associations between TNFR1 or TNFR2 and LA volume index or average E/e' ratio, as alternative measures of diastolic function that can be used for patients in AFib [25] . Increased activity of TNFa converting enzyme (TACE), a sheddase involved in proteolytic processing of TNFa, TNFRs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) might represent a mechanism of increased circulating TNFa and TNFRs in HF [26, 27] . ACE2 is a counter-regulatory homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and a major regulator of endothelial function and myocardial fibrosis [28] [29] [30] . Since the membranebound localization of TACE poses a limitation in assessing its levels or activity in the plasma, we measured plasma ACE2 activity as a surrogate, as it increases with increased TACE activity [31] . Previous reports of plasma ACE2 activity showed an association with clinically diagnosed HFREF, symptom severity and worsening clinical outcomes [20, 32] . In our HFPEF cohort, plasma ACE2 activity was significantly elevated relative to control Figure 3A) ; however, it was not associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction or NYHA class ( Figure 3B ). In this comparative analysis of healthy controls, and HF patients with preserved or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction, we found that our cohorts recapitulated previous characterizations, whereby, HFPEF subjects were more likely to be older, hypertensive and obese [3] [4] [5] 24] . Similarly, AFib was prevalent in both HF groups, which follows the trend observed in the MAGGIC meta-analysis [5] . Furthermore, the primary etiology of HF was much less likely to be ischemic in the HFPEF group. Despite differences in comorbidities, age and HF etiology the NYHA class distribution was similar between HFREF and HFPEF, which indicates that the two patient populations experienced significant burden of disease. Additionally, both groups had cardiac hypertrophy and exhibited marked diastolic dysfunction. In patients without marked systolic dysfunction, a greater prevalence of comorbidities might account for the similarity in symptoms between HFPEF and HFREF. Improvement in exercise capacity in a cohort of HFPEF patients after an exercise training regimen was largely mediated by peripheral improvements, which suggests a systemic component to HFPEF, including skeletal muscle dysregulation [33] . Indeed, a recent model of HFPEF suggests that comorbidity-mediated systemic inflammation, results in coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and skeletal muscle dysregulation to produce the HFPEF phenotype [6] . We investigated TNFa and its receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) as one component of comorbidity-driven inflammation, and included IL-6 as non-TNF-family cytokine for comparison. We expand on previous work in HF: our data showed that levels of TNFa and TNFR1 were significantly increased in HFPEF relative control but not HFREF, while TNFR2 was significantly increased relative to both control and HFREF [14] . Plasma IL-6 levels were very comparable between HFPEF and HFREF, which suggests that TNFa-mediated inflammation might be a point of pathophysiological difference between HF phenotypes.

The advanced age and greater prevalence of comorbidities in the HFPEF population could drive the observed elevation in circulating inflammatory markers relative to HFREF. Indeed, non-cardiac comorbidities are more prevalent in HFPEF, with a larger fraction of adverse clinical outcomes attributable to non-cardiac events compared to HFREF [34] . Likewise, increased TNFa-axis inflammation has been linked to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and allcause outcomes in HF [18, 35, 36] . Altogether, these data are congruent with the paradigm for HFPEF that includes comorbidities-driven dysregulation of TNFa-mediated signaling [6, 34] . Our finding that circulating TNFR2 levels are significantly associated with increasing average E/e' ratio and grade of diastolic dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF, suggests a greater role for TNFa-mediated inflammation in this cohort. However, we found that TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA class in both HF phenotypes, which shows that part of the HFREF phenotype can also be attributed to inflammation. The association of diastolic dysfunction and symptoms with TNFR2 in HFPEF is consistent with findings in experimental models, as the TNFR1/TNFR2 axis is involved in mediating divergent effects: TNFR1 has been implicated in adverse cardiac remodeling and adipogenesis, while TNFR2 antagonizes the pathological effects of TNFR1, and also stimulates angiogenesis [37] [38] [39] [40] . TNFR1 and TNFR2 also mediate opposite effects on phospholamban and SERCA2, key Ca 2+ handling proteins involved in myocardial relaxation [37, 41] . An increase in circulating TNFR2 levels might reflect a loss of protective signaling mechanisms due to tissue shedding of TNFR2, thereby leading to the correlation between circulating TNFR2 levels and diastolic dysfunction and symptoms in HFPEF. The differential role of TNFRs might explain why TNFa is not associated with function or symptoms: the variable response to TNFa is mediated at the receptor level. Congruent with a recent report, we found TNFa was not strongly associated with either HF phenotype; however, Marti et al. implicate TNFR1, while our study implicates TNFR2 in HFPEF [13] . The key difference between the two studies is that Marti et al. explored risk of incident HF, while we examined existing HF populations. Indeed, we found TNFR1 to be associated with the greatest number of HF risk factors, which is congruent with a role for TNFR1 in precipitating incident HFPEF. Meanwhile, our data show that TNFR2 might then be a better biomarker for gauging severity of established HFPEF. Circulating fragments of TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 are generated from full, transmembrane proteins through the activity of TACE [26, 27] . We hypothesized that increased circulating levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 might reflect increased activity of TACE. ACE2 is also a substrate of TACE, and plasma ACE2 activity increases in conjunction with increased TACE activity [26, 31] . Since TACE is membrane-bound, as a surrogate of TACE-activity we measured plasma ACE2 activity in HFPEF patients relative to healthy controls. Previous work showed a significant association between ACE2 and symptom severity and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HFREF [20, 32] . We found significantly elevated plasma ACE2 activity in HFPEF as compared to healthy controls, but no association to diastolic dysfunction or symptoms. This is congruent with the idea that elevated ACE2 activity is a consequence of the drivers of HFPEF, rather than an effector as may be the case in HFREF [20, 32] . Taking our data together with previous reports indicates that the TACE/TNFa/TNFR1/TNFR2 inflammatory axis is a part of the pathogenesis of HFPEF [7] [8] [9] [10] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In the context of the failure of TNFa antagonism as a therapeutic tool in HF, our data suggest that a downstream approach involving TNFR1 inhibition or TNFR2 potentiation may represent a more effective therapeutic approach for patients with HFPEF [42] . Our study, while larger than most other studies that compared levels of TNFa and its receptors in HFPEF versus HFREF, is still relatively small in terms of clinical studies. Indeed, TNFa might also be informative with respect to differentiating HFPEF from HFREF, but our study cannot resolve whether this is the case. In addition, the results reported herein represent a single crosssection across healthy controls, and HFPEF and HFREF patients, so follow-up measurements are not included, nor are outcomes data. Further studies with a longitudinal component will be important for implicating various molecules or pathways in the pathophysiological development of HF, for which work by Marti et al. is a strong contribution [13] . Finally, our results only provide correlative evidence of whether these biochemical markers are primary mediators of the HF syndrome, or end-effectors of pathogenic processes. Indeed, while a conglomerate of evidence points towards an interplay between plasma and tissue levels for TNFR1 and TNFR2-shedding increases plasma levels at the expense of tissue levels-direct tissue and plasma comparisons from the same subjects will be necessary to determine the relative effects of proteolytic processing and changes in expression.",
         "Circulating Levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptor 2 Are Increased in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Relative to Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction: Evidence for a Divergence in Pathophysiology. BACKGROUND: Various pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) axis in community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNFα, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNFα cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNFα and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both controls and HFREF. TNFα, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of symptoms in HFPEF. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation mediated through TNFα and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, may represent an important component of a comorbidity-induced inflammatory response that partially drives the pathophysiology of HFPEF.. Heart failure (HF) continues to have a significant clinical burden with a high mortality and morbidity, and has a worse one-year prognosis than cancer [1] . There are several classification schemes in HF; however, a common clinical approach involves classifying ambulatory patients with chronic HF into HF with preserved ($ 50%) or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (,50%; HFPEF or HFREF, respectively) [1, 2] . HFPEF presently accounts for approximately 40% of HF diagnoses, with a rising incidence, and mortality and morbidity comparable to HFREF [3] [4] [5] . Despite similarities in outcomes, it appears that HFPEF and HFREF represent distinct groups, with many pathophysiological differences, along the continuum of the HF [6] . Indeed, differential responses to therapeutic interventions between these two groups strongly support this concept. Clinical trials have validated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin IIreceptor blockers (ARB), beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) as therapeutics in HFREF [1] . Conversely, trials of ACEi, ARB, beta-blockers, MRA and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor failed to show any consistent and significant improvement in the clinical outcomes of patients with HFPEF. Biomarker studies have differentially implicated various pathways in HF, including fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodeling, oxidative and cardiomyocyte stress, and inflammation [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A recent report showed that circulating tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFa) receptor 1 (TNFR1) levels are significant predictors of incident HF, in particular for HFPEF versus HFREF [13] . Circulating TNFa and its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) are elevated in patients with heart failure relative to controls [6, 14] . The study presented herein expands on previous work by exploring associations between diastolic dysfunction or heart failure severity, and plasma levels of TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2, as well as a non-TNFa family cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in community-based cohorts of healthy controls, and ambulatory HFPEF and HFREF patients. Using well-defined HF cohorts, we set out to elucidate some elements of the mechanisms that drive HFPEF and HFREF. Our novel findings suggest that elevated plasma levels of TNFa receptors, in particular TNFR2, are more closely linked to the pathophysiology of HFPEF than HFREF. This study conforms with the conventions outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, it received internal ethics board approval at the Universities of Alberta and Calgary for use of human subjects, and all subjects gave written informed consent [15] . As part of a prospective clinical study, the Alberta HEART (Heart Failure Etiology and Analysis Research Team) project, community-based, ambulatory patients with clinical diagnoses of HF and healthy age-and gender-matched controls (n = 50) were consecutively recruited for comprehensive clinical, echocardiographic and biomarker analyses during a three-year period beginning in 2010 through the end of 2012. Blood pressure was recorded sitting or recumbent, and detailed clinical data were compiled at the time of enrollment. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed using the Phillips IE33 ultrasound platform. Echocardiograms were interpreted by cardiologists with specialized echocardiography training who were blinded to both the clinical classification and biomarker analyses. LVEF was assessed using Simpson's biplane method of disks. HF patients were adjudicated as HFREF (n = 100) or HFPEF (n = 100) using an LVEF cutoff of 50%, according to clinical practice guidelines [1, 2] . Adjudication of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and primary etiology of HF were determined by cardiologists blinded to biomarker analyses. Grading of diastolic dysfunction was performed by blinded members of the authorship team based on previously published guidelines [16] . LA volume index, lateral e' and medial e' were used as a binary classifier for diastolic dysfunction, after which E/A ratio, or average E/e' ratio, for patients in AFib, was used to ascertain grade in those determined to have diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction analyses could not be performed due to poor echocardiographic visualization in 9 HFPEF patients and 14 HFREF patients, and a further 1 HFPEF patient and 7 HFREF patients were excluded from diastolic function analyses due to the presence of severe mitral regurgitation (MR). BNP levels were assessed as previously described using an Alere Triage reagent pack (Alere Inc., Ottawa, ON, CAN) read in an automated DxI 800 immunoanalyzer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) at provincial heath laboratories in the province of Alberta [17] . Serum levels of creatinine and lipid profiles were available in study subjects' health records as part of their clinical evaluation. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls were as follows: no history of cardiovascular or renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, or atrial fibrillation; and no prescriptions for antiarrhythmics; ACEi; ARB; beta-blockers; digoxin; loop or thiazide diuretics; or MRA. Exclusion criteria for all study groups were any of the following: age less than 18 years; known malignancy, with expected survival time less than one year; pregnancy within the previous six months; recent cardiac event, including acute MI and decompensated HF; moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension; or severe mitral or aortic valvular stenosis. Blood for plasma analysis was collected during a one-day baseline enrolment which included the acquisition of the echocardiograms and ECGs. Patients were rested and sitting while blood was collected into cooled lithium-heparin tubes, which were immediately placed on ice prior to plasma fractionation and deep freezing at #275uC. Commercially-available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for TNF-a, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 (catalogue no. 's STA00C, SRT100, SRT200 and S6050, respectively, R&D Systems, MN, USA) were used as previously described [18, 19] . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with the wavelength correction set to 540 nm for all assays using a SpectraMax M5 Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Detection rates for the ELISAs were 72.4%, 100%, 100% and 81.2%, respectively. The inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 13.1% and 9.5% (n = 4); 7.0% and 5.2% (n = 4); 5.3% and 3.5% (n = 4); and 8.0% and 6.3% (n = 4), respectively. Plasma ACE2 activity was measured using a previously established immunofluorescence protocol [20] . Lithium heparin anti-coagulated platelet-free plasma samples were diluted to a final ratio of 30:70 in plasma assay buffer: 1 M NaCl (Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA), 75 mM Tris-HCl (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and 5 mM ZnCl 2 (Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA) at pH 6.5. Assay buffer was made to contain various protease inhibitors: 10 mM captopril (ACE inhibitor; Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA); 5 mM amastatin (aminopeptidase inhibitor; Sigma Chem.

The use of protease inhibitors in the buffer solution was meant to ensure that the fluorogenic substrate and specific ACE2 inhibitor (both described below), which are integral to the assay, were not cleaved by other proteases naturally present in human plasma. Samples were incubated with Dnp-quenched Mca-containing fluorogenic substrate (catalogue no. ES007, R&D Systems, MN, USA) at a final concentration of 10 mM at 37uC. To find the fluorescence increase due to ACE2 activity, plasma samples were assayed both in the presence and absence of the specific linear ACE2 inhibitor, DX600 (catalogue no. 002-26, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, CA, USA). Fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission settings at 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively, using SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The maximal fluorescence increase due to ACE2 activity was determined from the maximum fluorescence difference between inhibited and uninhibited aliquots; this was normalized to a standard curve for Mca-containing fluorescent peptide (catalogue no. M-1975, Bachem, CA, USA) and scaled for time of measurement and plasma volume over 24 hours, with 1 hour as the baseline. All ACE2 enzymatic activity values herein are expressed in pmol/hr/mL, which describes the amount of substrate turned over per unit time per unit volume of plasma. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 10.2% and 7.5% (n = 10), respectively. Continuous data in tables are expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR) in parentheses. Continuous data in figures are expressed as box and whisker plots on a logarithmic scale to account for non-normal distributions, where boxes represent IQR with median as a bisecting line, while whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values. Categorical data are expressed as percentages. All categorical data were compared using Pearson Chi-square tests, while continuous variables analyzed by category were compared using Mann-Whitney U Test or Kruskal-Wallis Test with Mann-Whitney U Test for pairwise comparisons, where appropriate. Associations between categorical factors or continuous covariates and circulating inflammatory markers were tested using binary logistic or linear regression analyses, respectively, with log-transformed inflammatory marker levels to account for non-normal distributions. Associations between increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction or NYHA functional class and plasma biomarkers were tested using ordinal logistic regression analyses with log-transformed inflammatory marker levels. Forest plots are used to graphically display results from logistic regression analyses. A p-value,0.05 was considered significant for all statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics Version 20 (IBM, NY, USA). Obesity was defined as BMI$30 kg/m 2 per WHO criteria [21] . Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the revised four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation [22] . Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as left-ventricular mass index (LVMI) $115 g/m 2 for males and $ 95 g/m 2 for females per previously published criteria [23] . Demographic and clinical information for the control, HFPEF and HFREF groups is displayed in Table 1 . In this study, the HF patient populations recapitulated observations in previous reports [3] [4] [5] 24] . The study subjects were predominantly of white race in all study groups (Table 1) . HFPEF patients were older (p = 0.003), and significantly more were obese (p = 0.016) and hypertensive than HFREF patients, while neither HF group had different gender ratios (p = 0.210), histories of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.234) or atrial fibrillation (AFib; Table 1 ). Interestingly, total cholesterol (p = 0.774), triglycerides (p = 0.656) and total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (p = 0.187) were not significantly different between HF phenotypes, despite differences in obesity prevalence (Table 1) . Ischemic etiology was more prevalent in HFREF than HFPEF, but both groups were on evidence-based therapeutic regimens (Table 1 ). Importantly, drugs that can affect inflammation were comparably used by the two HF groups: NSAID use was equivalent and statin use was not significantly different (p = 0.438; Table 1 ). NYHA functional class distribution was also not significantly different between the HFPEF and HFREF groups (Table 1) . Heart rates did not differ significantly between controls or the two HF groups; however, a significantly greater number of HFPEF patients were in AFib on the day of study than HFREF patients (p = 0.018; Table 2 ). The HFREF group had significantly lower LVEF compared to control and HFPEF groups, while both HFPEF and HFREF had greater LV posterior wall thickness (LVPW; p,0.001 for both) and mass index (LVMI; p,0.001 for both); left atrial volume index (LA volume index; p,0.001 for both); and average E/e' ratio (p,0.001 for both) compared to control (Table 2) . LVPW (p,0.05), and left ventricular end diastolic and systolic dimensions (LVEDD and LVESD, respectively; p,0.001 for both) were significantly different between the two HF groups ( Table 2 ). The distributions of grades of diastolic dysfunction were also significantly different (p = 0.043), which might be due to the high prevalence of AFib acting as a confounder in this analysis ( Table 2) . Significantly more HFREF subjects had left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than HFPEF subjects (p,0.001; Table 2 ). Circulating inflammatory markers in healthy control, HFPEF and HFREF Compared to control, plasma levels of TNFa were only significantly elevated in HPFEF, while levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were significantly elevated in both HFPEF and HFREF ( Figure 1A-C) . Meanwhile, IL-6 was not significantly different between control and the HF groups ( Figure 1D ). Interestingly, TNFR2 was significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to HFREF, while TNFa and TNFR1 were non-significantly elevated in HFPEF ( Figure 1A-C) . We explored the relationship between age, eGFR, sex, obesity, LVH, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation with TNFa, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 in the combined HF group (Table 3) . Advanced age was significantly associated with elevated TNFR1 and TNFR2, and low eGFR was significantly associated with elevated TNFa in addition to its two receptors (Table 3) . TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 increased differentially in response to smoking status or comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, but were always associated with at least two covariates, while IL-6 was not associated with any covariate (Table 3) . Sex, obesity and LVH were not significantly associated with any of the inflammatory markers ( Table 3) . We investigated how the inflammatory markers in this study related to two clinically-relevant and commonly-used ordinal quantifications of disease status in HF: grade of diastolic dysfunction and NYHA functional class. We investigated these associations using ordinal logistic regression analyses. Elevated TNFR2 was significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF, while TNFR1 was not associated with diastolic dysfunction in either HF group ( Figure 2A) . Interestingly, elevated TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA functional class in both HPFEF and HFREF (Figure 2A ). Neither TNFa, nor IL-6 were significantly associated with diastolic dysfunction or symptom severity in either HFPEF or HFREF (data not shown). LA volume index was not associated with plasma TNFR1 or TNFR2 levels in HFPEF (r = 0.110, p = 0.298; and r = 0.170, p = 0.105, respectively) or HFREF (r = 0.083, p = 0.443; and r = 0.056, p = 0.607, respectively). Plasma levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were weakly, but significantly, associated with average E/ e' ratio in HFPEF ( Figure 2B & C) , but not HFREF (r = 0.215, p = 0.053; and r = 0.112, p = 0.318, respectively). Given that AFib can confound diastolic dysfunction analyses, we investigated associations between TNFR1 or TNFR2 and LA volume index or average E/e' ratio, as alternative measures of diastolic function that can be used for patients in AFib [25] . Increased activity of TNFa converting enzyme (TACE), a sheddase involved in proteolytic processing of TNFa, TNFRs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) might represent a mechanism of increased circulating TNFa and TNFRs in HF [26, 27] . ACE2 is a counter-regulatory homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and a major regulator of endothelial function and myocardial fibrosis [28] [29] [30] . Since the membranebound localization of TACE poses a limitation in assessing its levels or activity in the plasma, we measured plasma ACE2 activity as a surrogate, as it increases with increased TACE activity [31] . Previous reports of plasma ACE2 activity showed an association with clinically diagnosed HFREF, symptom severity and worsening clinical outcomes [20, 32] . In our HFPEF cohort, plasma ACE2 activity was significantly elevated relative to control Figure 3A) ; however, it was not associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction or NYHA class ( Figure 3B ). In this comparative analysis of healthy controls, and HF patients with preserved or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction, we found that our cohorts recapitulated previous characterizations, whereby, HFPEF subjects were more likely to be older, hypertensive and obese [3] [4] [5] 24] . Similarly, AFib was prevalent in both HF groups, which follows the trend observed in the MAGGIC meta-analysis [5] . Furthermore, the primary etiology of HF was much less likely to be ischemic in the HFPEF group. Despite differences in comorbidities, age and HF etiology the NYHA class distribution was similar between HFREF and HFPEF, which indicates that the two patient populations experienced significant burden of disease. Additionally, both groups had cardiac hypertrophy and exhibited marked diastolic dysfunction. In patients without marked systolic dysfunction, a greater prevalence of comorbidities might account for the similarity in symptoms between HFPEF and HFREF. Improvement in exercise capacity in a cohort of HFPEF patients after an exercise training regimen was largely mediated by peripheral improvements, which suggests a systemic component to HFPEF, including skeletal muscle dysregulation [33] . Indeed, a recent model of HFPEF suggests that comorbidity-mediated systemic inflammation, results in coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and skeletal muscle dysregulation to produce the HFPEF phenotype [6] . We investigated TNFa and its receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) as one component of comorbidity-driven inflammation, and included IL-6 as non-TNF-family cytokine for comparison. We expand on previous work in HF: our data showed that levels of TNFa and TNFR1 were significantly increased in HFPEF relative control but not HFREF, while TNFR2 was significantly increased relative to both control and HFREF [14] . Plasma IL-6 levels were very comparable between HFPEF and HFREF, which suggests that TNFa-mediated inflammation might be a point of pathophysiological difference between HF phenotypes.

The advanced age and greater prevalence of comorbidities in the HFPEF population could drive the observed elevation in circulating inflammatory markers relative to HFREF. Indeed, non-cardiac comorbidities are more prevalent in HFPEF, with a larger fraction of adverse clinical outcomes attributable to non-cardiac events compared to HFREF [34] . Likewise, increased TNFa-axis inflammation has been linked to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and allcause outcomes in HF [18, 35, 36] . Altogether, these data are congruent with the paradigm for HFPEF that includes comorbidities-driven dysregulation of TNFa-mediated signaling [6, 34] . Our finding that circulating TNFR2 levels are significantly associated with increasing average E/e' ratio and grade of diastolic dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF, suggests a greater role for TNFa-mediated inflammation in this cohort. However, we found that TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA class in both HF phenotypes, which shows that part of the HFREF phenotype can also be attributed to inflammation. The association of diastolic dysfunction and symptoms with TNFR2 in HFPEF is consistent with findings in experimental models, as the TNFR1/TNFR2 axis is involved in mediating divergent effects: TNFR1 has been implicated in adverse cardiac remodeling and adipogenesis, while TNFR2 antagonizes the pathological effects of TNFR1, and also stimulates angiogenesis [37] [38] [39] [40] . TNFR1 and TNFR2 also mediate opposite effects on phospholamban and SERCA2, key Ca 2+ handling proteins involved in myocardial relaxation [37, 41] . An increase in circulating TNFR2 levels might reflect a loss of protective signaling mechanisms due to tissue shedding of TNFR2, thereby leading to the correlation between circulating TNFR2 levels and diastolic dysfunction and symptoms in HFPEF. The differential role of TNFRs might explain why TNFa is not associated with function or symptoms: the variable response to TNFa is mediated at the receptor level. Congruent with a recent report, we found TNFa was not strongly associated with either HF phenotype; however, Marti et al. implicate TNFR1, while our study implicates TNFR2 in HFPEF [13] . The key difference between the two studies is that Marti et al. explored risk of incident HF, while we examined existing HF populations. Indeed, we found TNFR1 to be associated with the greatest number of HF risk factors, which is congruent with a role for TNFR1 in precipitating incident HFPEF. Meanwhile, our data show that TNFR2 might then be a better biomarker for gauging severity of established HFPEF. Circulating fragments of TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 are generated from full, transmembrane proteins through the activity of TACE [26, 27] . We hypothesized that increased circulating levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 might reflect increased activity of TACE. ACE2 is also a substrate of TACE, and plasma ACE2 activity increases in conjunction with increased TACE activity [26, 31] . Since TACE is membrane-bound, as a surrogate of TACE-activity we measured plasma ACE2 activity in HFPEF patients relative to healthy controls. Previous work showed a significant association between ACE2 and symptom severity and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HFREF [20, 32] . We found significantly elevated plasma ACE2 activity in HFPEF as compared to healthy controls, but no association to diastolic dysfunction or symptoms. This is congruent with the idea that elevated ACE2 activity is a consequence of the drivers of HFPEF, rather than an effector as may be the case in HFREF [20, 32] . Taking our data together with previous reports indicates that the TACE/TNFa/TNFR1/TNFR2 inflammatory axis is a part of the pathogenesis of HFPEF [7] [8] [9] [10] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In the context of the failure of TNFa antagonism as a therapeutic tool in HF, our data suggest that a downstream approach involving TNFR1 inhibition or TNFR2 potentiation may represent a more effective therapeutic approach for patients with HFPEF [42] . Our study, while larger than most other studies that compared levels of TNFa and its receptors in HFPEF versus HFREF, is still relatively small in terms of clinical studies. Indeed, TNFa might also be informative with respect to differentiating HFPEF from HFREF, but our study cannot resolve whether this is the case. In addition, the results reported herein represent a single crosssection across healthy controls, and HFPEF and HFREF patients, so follow-up measurements are not included, nor are outcomes data. Further studies with a longitudinal component will be important for implicating various molecules or pathways in the pathophysiological development of HF, for which work by Marti et al. is a strong contribution [13] . Finally, our results only provide correlative evidence of whether these biochemical markers are primary mediators of the HF syndrome, or end-effectors of pathogenic processes. Indeed, while a conglomerate of evidence points towards an interplay between plasma and tissue levels for TNFR1 and TNFR2-shedding increases plasma levels at the expense of tissue levels-direct tissue and plasma comparisons from the same subjects will be necessary to determine the relative effects of proteolytic processing and changes in expression.",

         "Intestinal current measurement versus nasal potential difference measurements for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: a case–control study",
         "BACKGROUND: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl(-) + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI(sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.

         "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is diagnosed based on a defined clinical phenotype and confirmation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) dysfunction, commonly demonstrated by a sweat chloride value of ≥ 60 mmol/l and/or detection of two CF-causing mutations [1, 2] . A small but increasing number of patients present with clinical symptoms characteristic of CF, an intermediate (30- 60 mmol/l) or negative (≤29 mml/l) sweat test, and less than two CF-causing mutations [3] [4] [5] [6] . For these query CF patients, a specific and sensitive CFTR functional test to exclude or confirm a CFTR functional defect characteristic of CF is needed [1, 6] . CFTR modulating and correcting drugs have improved CFTR-function in cell cultures [7] . To test their effect in CF-patients, especially those with rare mutations, CFTR-functional tests with low variability and high reproducibility are needed [7] . In addition to sweat testing, two additional CFTR functional tests have been developed over the past 30 years; nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement [8] and intestinal current measurement (ICM) [9] . CFTR function is measured in vivo in the respiratory epithelium by NPD and ex vivo in superficial rectal biopsies by ICM. International standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been established for both tests [8, 10] . Both tests block epithelial sodium channels by amiloride and stimulate cAMPmediated CFTR-mediated chloride transport in chloridefree solution and isoproterenol (NPD) or forskolin and IBMX (ICM). In addition, cholinergic chloride transport is tested by carbachol with ICM. The change after chloridefree and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl − + Iso) with NPD [8] and the sum of the responses after carbachol, forskolin/IBMX ( [11] ) plus histamine (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine ) with ICM [12] has been proposed to be the best parameter of CFTR function. Both techniques can discriminate CF patients from healthy controls (NPD [13, 14] ; ICM [11, 12, 15, 16] ), but comparative clinical trials are lacking. Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR-function [17, 18] , but the impact on the diagnostic aspects of NPD and ICM have not been investigated. We performed NPD and ICM measurement in CFpatients and healthy controls to determine (1) the ability of these measurements to differentiate CF patients from healthy controls, and (2) the influence of smoking on CFTR function in healthy controls. Between October 2012 and February 2013, 18 patients with CF and 13 healthy controls were recruited at the Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany. For this study, the diagnosis of CF was based on at least one clinical manifestation of CF, sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/l and the presence of two CF-causing mutations [1] . Pancreatic sufficiency (PS) was defined as fecal elastase >100 μg/g stool. Healthy controls had no clinical manifestation of CF and a sweat chloride value <60 mmol/l (Non-CF). Smoking was defined as any active or passive exposure to tobacco smoke. Exclusion criteria were participation in another medical clinical trial during the past 30 days, acute respiratory symptoms, intake of ivacaftor, known hemorrhoids, or bleeding diathesis. The ethics committee of the Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen approved the protocol (AZ109/12). The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant aged 18 years and older. For participants younger than 18 years of age, written informed consent was obtained from each participant's parents or legal guardian, and age-appropriate consent was obtained from each participant. The sweat test, NPD, and ICM were performed on the same day for each subject. The sweat test was performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [19] . For sweat stimulation and collection, the Macroduct® system (Wescor, Data are shown as ratios or the mean ± standard deviation incl. median (minmax). *p <0.001 (CF-all versus controls); **p = 0.003 (CF-PI versus CF-PS). Inc., Logan, USA) was used. Chloride was measured by chloride titration. A sweat chloride level ≥60 mmol/l was interpreted as within the CF range, 30-60 mmol/l as equivocal, and ≤29 mmol as normal [1] . NPD was performed by one operator who was accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundations' (CFF) Therapeutic Developments Network (TDN), and followed the CFF TDN SOP (version: January 2009) [8] . We used terbutaline as a substitute for isoproterenol in accordance with the SOP. The chloride-free and isoproterenol response (Δ0Cl − + Iso) (NPD CFTR response) and the Wilschanksi score (defined as e (response to chloride-free and isoproterenol/response to amiloride) ) [20] representing the CFTR response were calculated as the average or best result from both nostrils. The Δ0Cl − + Iso was interpreted as normal when < −12 mV, as in the CF range when > −7.7 mV, and as equivocal for results between −12 and −7.7 mV [6] . The Wilschanski score was interpreted as normal (<0.65), in the CF-range (>0.70), or equivocal (0.65-0.70) [20] . If the mean Δ0Cl − + Iso was > −7.7 mV in healthy controls, the NPD was repeated on a different day. Only the measurement with the highest Δ0Cl − + Iso was reported. If both measurements confirmed a Δ0Cl − + Iso in the CF range, CFTR genotyping (sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) was offered as part of the participant's clinical care and reported as part of the baseline data. Genotyping of all healthy controls was not ethically approved. The For ICM, at least 4 superficial rectal biopsies were obtained by suction biopsies (aspiration biopsy instrument according to Wilital (UE7605); ulrich GmbH, Ulm, Germany) without prior bowel preparation. Biopsies were immediately stored in ice-cold buffer solution (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline and indomethacin, final concentration 10 μM) and mounted on adequate tissue sliders. After mounting the sliders in the heated and slightly sparged (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) 4-chamber system, each basal resistance was measured by applying short current pulses (15 μA) and registering the corresponding change in V t (typical range 15-30 Ohm × cm 2 ) with the VCC MC4S Multi-Channel Voltage Current Clamp (Physiologic Instrument, San Diego, USA). After that the voltage was clamped at 0 mV and the raw short circuit current ( r I sc ) was recorded from then on. Due to different sliders with different areas (P2407C [1.5 mm diameter aperture slider; area 0.018 cm 2 ] or P2407B [1.2 mm diameter aperture slider; area 0.011 cm 2 ]); Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, USA), the raw r I sc was converted to I sc (μA/ cm 2 ). After applying 100 μM carbachol (which stimulates cholinergic Cl − secretion by opening basolateral K + channels) to the serosal compartment, an I sc response was evoked for quality control of the biopsy. After a 40-min equilibration in Meyler buffer, the basal I sc was noted and 2 μl amiloride (to block amiloride-sensitive sodium channels) was added to the mucosal compartment. After 5 min or when the I sc was stable, 10 μM forskolin and 100 μM IBMX (to stimulate cAMPdependent CFTR-Cl − transport) were added to the mucosal and serosal compartments (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX ). After a minimum of 10 min, 10 μM genisteine (CFTR-potentiator) was added to both compartments. After a minimum of 5 min, 100 μM carbachol was added to the serosal compartment (ΔI sc, carbachol ). After a minimum of 10 min, 200 μM 4,4′-Diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) (blocking non-CFTR-Cl − channels) was added to the mucosal compartment. After 10 min, 500 μM histamine (to stimulate Ca 2+ and proteinkinase Cmediated CFTR Cl − secretion) was added to the serosal compartment (ΔI sc, histamine ). In the open circuit, the final transepithelial voltage and final resistance were measured by applying short current pulses as in the beginning. Preliminary data suggested that the average ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine is the best diagnostic ICM parameter for chloride secretory response (ICM CFTR response), but reference ranges have not been established [10] . Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (normally distributed variables), respective the median values, and 25th and 75th percentiles (nonnormally distributed variables). Group comparisons were performed using the Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test for normally or non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (release 21; IBM, Armonk, USA). Our study included 18 patients with CF and 13 healthy controls with a median age of 20.5 and 25.0 years, respectively (NS) ( Table 1 ). As consequence of our inclusion criteria, sweat chloride values distinguish patients with CF from healthy controls (p < 0.001). Although the mean sweat chloride differed between CF-PS and CF-PI patients (p = 0.003), an individual overlap occurs (Table 1, Figure 1 ). The mean NPD CFTR response significantly discriminated between CF patients and healthy controls (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS versus PI (Table 1 ). Four healthy controls had an average Δ0Cl − + Iso of > −7.7 mV. Three out of four controls had a repeatable average NPD CFTR response in the CF-range for Δ0Cl − + Iso > −7.7 mV (23% of all healthy controls) (Figure 1 ), and two additional controls when using the Wilschanski score (15% of all healthy controls) (Figure 2 ). All these healthy controls were smokers. CFTR genotyping was offered to these three healthy controls as part of clinical routine and none had two CF-causing mutations (Table 1) . For ICM a median of 6 (5-7) rectal biopsies were sampled per patient without severe adverse events. The mean ICM CFTR response was significantly different between CF patients and healthy controls (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS versus those who were PI (Table 1) . We could not detect any age-dependency of the response to Isoproterenol/Forskolin. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap between CF-patients and controls (Figures 3  and 4 ). Using the best instead of the average NPD, the CFTR response overlap did not change (Additional file 1). Using the best instead of the average ICM, the CFTR response resulted in one overlap (Additional file 2). In healthy controls, smoking had no influence on sweat chloride (NS), but decreased CFTR function as measured by NPD (p = 0.049) ( Table 2 and Figure 5 ), Figure 3 Correlation between the average ΔIsc (forskolin/IBMX + carbachol + histamine) (ICM) and average Δ0Cl − + Iso (NPD). The normal range is shown left of the dotted line. The intermediate range is shown between the solid and dotted lines. A higher ΔIsc (forskolin/ IBMX + carbachol + histamine) represents a better CFTR response. and resulted in intermediate or even abnormal NPD results, but not ICM or sweat chloride results. There is a trend in ICM measurements indicative that smoking might not only affect CFTR in the respiratory tract, but also in the intestine (Table 2 and Figure 6 ). ICM is superior to NPD for distinguishing between CF patients with a sweat chloride >60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM diffe rentiated patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD, and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD. There is a trend in ICM indicative that smoking might not only affect CFTR in the respiratory tract, but also in the intestine, which has no impact on diagnostic interpretation. NPD has been used as a diagnostic test for CF since the late 1980s [14, 21, 22] . Studies have shown 94.8-100% sensitivity and 96.5-100% specificity of Δ0Cl − + Iso for separating PI patients with CF from healthy controls [13, 14, 23] . Experience with a broader spectrum of patients with CF [24, 25] and equivocal patients (sweat chloride <60 mmol/l and less than two CF-causing mutations) [20] described a clinically relevant overlap for Δ0Cl − + Iso. Even in F508del homozygous patients, a residual CFTR NPD response with [26] or without [27, 28] an observed clinical difference has been described. Some centers introduced an intermediate category for Δ0Cl − + Iso [6] , interpret the highest NPD CFTR response [29] , or use a composite score that includes sodium and chloride conductance [20, 30] . Irrespective of the diagnostic criteria, our result showed a clinically relevant overlap between patients with CF and healthy controls. A normal average NPD CFTR response excludes CF, but an abnormal average NPD CFTR response could occur in healthy controls, especially in smokers, and can lead to a false-positive diagnosis of CF. A repeated measurement of a pathologic NPD response reduced the falsepositive results in 1 out of 4 healthy controls in our cohort and should be recommended as a standard approach. ICM was developed as a research tool for CFTR function in the 1990s [31] and has been used as a diagnostic test since the early 2000s [15, 32] . Two different protocols are established; the Freiburg protocol [9] and the original [33] and adapted [34] Rotterdam protocol. We used the newest ECFS-ICM-SOP, which is an adapted Rotterdam protocol. The combination of cAMP-mediated Cl − secretion, and the carbachol and histamine (Rotterdam protocol) responses separate patients with CF from those without CF [11, 12, 34] , but not patients with CF who are PS from those who are PI [11, 12] , which is in accordance with our results. The 50% loss of CFTR protein in CF heterozygotes could not be detected by ICM [35] independent of the protocol [15, 32] . For the Rotterdam protocol, De Jonge postulated that the ICM response is not proportional to the CFTR amount in the apical membrane of coloncytes except at a low level (<10-15%) and could therefore only detect an 80-85% loss of CFTR expression/ function [32] . Therefore, mild mutations could result in a false-negative ICM. Interestingly, Derichs reported 8 patients with a sweat chloride >60 mmol/l, fewer than two CF-causing mutations after sequencing, and a normal ICM response who were judged as CF unlikely [12] . Our results with the new ECFS-ICM SOP confirm the high predictive value and practicability of this adapted ICM Rotterdam protocol. Our data suggest that NPD is more likely to detect CFTR dysfunction in healthy controls than the ICM or sweat test. This could be explained by tissue specific differences in CFTR expression, alternative chloride channel expression, or extrinsic factors. Kälin et al. showed identical CFTR expression in the respiratory and intestinal tract of F508del-homozygous patients and healthy controls [36] . Highly variable CFTR expression in the nose [37] and colon [38] of F508del homozygous patients has been described, varying from 0-100% [37] . Therefore, in the respiratory and intestinal tract, individual CFTR expression seems to be more relevant than tissue specific expression. Alternative chloride channels could contribute to the chloride conductance, but have not been described in the distal colon [39] . Furthermore, previous infections [40] , milder trauma [14] , smoking [17] , increased paracellular permeability [41] , and decreased CFTR expression [42] and CFTR response [43] . With the exception of smoking, these extrinsic factors are relevant only for NPD, but not for rectal biopsies [44] . Smoking causes a decreased NPD response [17] , but although a decreased systemic CFTR function mediated by acrolein [18] . Raju et al. demonstrated a 65% decrease in the ICM CFTR response in healthy smokers compared with non-smokers [18] . Our results confirm these findings. In contrast to NPD, smoking did not influence the diagnostic cut-off for ICM in our cohort. Therefore, ICM seems to be a more robust diagnostic test than NPD to distinguish primary from secondary CFTR dysfunction. This is important for the interpretation of NPD as an adjunctive diagnostic test in patients with query-CF who are exposed to smoking. Limitations of our study include the small number of participants in each group, the lack of patients with CF with a sweat chloride value < 60 mmol/l, and patients with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). The strength of our study is the genotyping of healthy controls with an abnormal CFTR NPD response, and the use of standardized protocols for sweat testing, NPD, and ICM.

         "Intestinal current measurement versus nasal potential difference measurements for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: a case–control study. BACKGROUND: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl(-) + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI(sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2466-14-156) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is diagnosed based on a defined clinical phenotype and confirmation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) dysfunction, commonly demonstrated by a sweat chloride value of ≥ 60 mmol/l and/or detection of two CF-causing mutations [1, 2] . A small but increasing number of patients present with clinical symptoms characteristic of CF, an intermediate (30- 60 mmol/l) or negative (≤29 mml/l) sweat test, and less than two CF-causing mutations [3] [4] [5] [6] . For these query CF patients, a specific and sensitive CFTR functional test to exclude or confirm a CFTR functional defect characteristic of CF is needed [1, 6] . CFTR modulating and correcting drugs have improved CFTR-function in cell cultures [7] . To test their effect in CF-patients, especially those with rare mutations, CFTR-functional tests with low variability and high reproducibility are needed [7] . In addition to sweat testing, two additional CFTR functional tests have been developed over the past 30 years; nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement [8] and intestinal current measurement (ICM) [9] . CFTR function is measured in vivo in the respiratory epithelium by NPD and ex vivo in superficial rectal biopsies by ICM. International standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been established for both tests [8, 10] . Both tests block epithelial sodium channels by amiloride and stimulate cAMPmediated CFTR-mediated chloride transport in chloridefree solution and isoproterenol (NPD) or forskolin and IBMX (ICM). In addition, cholinergic chloride transport is tested by carbachol with ICM. The change after chloridefree and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl − + Iso) with NPD [8] and the sum of the responses after carbachol, forskolin/IBMX ( [11] ) plus histamine (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine ) with ICM [12] has been proposed to be the best parameter of CFTR function. Both techniques can discriminate CF patients from healthy controls (NPD [13, 14] ; ICM [11, 12, 15, 16] ), but comparative clinical trials are lacking. Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR-function [17, 18] , but the impact on the diagnostic aspects of NPD and ICM have not been investigated. We performed NPD and ICM measurement in CFpatients and healthy controls to determine (1) the ability of these measurements to differentiate CF patients from healthy controls, and (2) the influence of smoking on CFTR function in healthy controls. Between October 2012 and February 2013, 18 patients with CF and 13 healthy controls were recruited at the Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany. For this study, the diagnosis of CF was based on at least one clinical manifestation of CF, sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/l and the presence of two CF-causing mutations [1] . Pancreatic sufficiency (PS) was defined as fecal elastase >100 μg/g stool. Healthy controls had no clinical manifestation of CF and a sweat chloride value <60 mmol/l (Non-CF). Smoking was defined as any active or passive exposure to tobacco smoke. Exclusion criteria were participation in another medical clinical trial during the past 30 days, acute respiratory symptoms, intake of ivacaftor, known hemorrhoids, or bleeding diathesis. The ethics committee of the Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen approved the protocol (AZ109/12). The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant aged 18 years and older. For participants younger than 18 years of age, written informed consent was obtained from each participant's parents or legal guardian, and age-appropriate consent was obtained from each participant. The sweat test, NPD, and ICM were performed on the same day for each subject. The sweat test was performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [19] . For sweat stimulation and collection, the Macroduct® system (Wescor, Data are shown as ratios or the mean ± standard deviation incl. median (minmax). *p <0.001 (CF-all versus controls); **p = 0.003 (CF-PI versus CF-PS). Inc., Logan, USA) was used. Chloride was measured by chloride titration. A sweat chloride level ≥60 mmol/l was interpreted as within the CF range, 30-60 mmol/l as equivocal, and ≤29 mmol as normal [1] . NPD was performed by one operator who was accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundations' (CFF) Therapeutic Developments Network (TDN), and followed the CFF TDN SOP (version: January 2009) [8] . We used terbutaline as a substitute for isoproterenol in accordance with the SOP. The chloride-free and isoproterenol response (Δ0Cl − + Iso) (NPD CFTR response) and the Wilschanksi score (defined as e (response to chloride-free and isoproterenol/response to amiloride) ) [20] representing the CFTR response were calculated as the average or best result from both nostrils. The Δ0Cl − + Iso was interpreted as normal when < −12 mV, as in the CF range when > −7.7 mV, and as equivocal for results between −12 and −7.7 mV [6] . The Wilschanski score was interpreted as normal (<0.65), in the CF-range (>0.70), or equivocal (0.65-0.70) [20] . If the mean Δ0Cl − + Iso was > −7.7 mV in healthy controls, the NPD was repeated on a different day. Only the measurement with the highest Δ0Cl − + Iso was reported. If both measurements confirmed a Δ0Cl − + Iso in the CF range, CFTR genotyping (sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) was offered as part of the participant's clinical care and reported as part of the baseline data. Genotyping of all healthy controls was not ethically approved. The For ICM, at least 4 superficial rectal biopsies were obtained by suction biopsies (aspiration biopsy instrument according to Wilital (UE7605); ulrich GmbH, Ulm, Germany) without prior bowel preparation. Biopsies were immediately stored in ice-cold buffer solution (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline and indomethacin, final concentration 10 μM) and mounted on adequate tissue sliders. After mounting the sliders in the heated and slightly sparged (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) 4-chamber system, each basal resistance was measured by applying short current pulses (15 μA) and registering the corresponding change in V t (typical range 15-30 Ohm × cm 2 ) with the VCC MC4S Multi-Channel Voltage Current Clamp (Physiologic Instrument, San Diego, USA). After that the voltage was clamped at 0 mV and the raw short circuit current ( r I sc ) was recorded from then on. Due to different sliders with different areas (P2407C [1.5 mm diameter aperture slider; area 0.018 cm 2 ] or P2407B [1.2 mm diameter aperture slider; area 0.011 cm 2 ]); Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, USA), the raw r I sc was converted to I sc (μA/ cm 2 ). After applying 100 μM carbachol (which stimulates cholinergic Cl − secretion by opening basolateral K + channels) to the serosal compartment, an I sc response was evoked for quality control of the biopsy. After a 40-min equilibration in Meyler buffer, the basal I sc was noted and 2 μl amiloride (to block amiloride-sensitive sodium channels) was added to the mucosal compartment. After 5 min or when the I sc was stable, 10 μM forskolin and 100 μM IBMX (to stimulate cAMPdependent CFTR-Cl − transport) were added to the mucosal and serosal compartments (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX ). After a minimum of 10 min, 10 μM genisteine (CFTR-potentiator) was added to both compartments. After a minimum of 5 min, 100 μM carbachol was added to the serosal compartment (ΔI sc, carbachol ). After a minimum of 10 min, 200 μM 4,4′-Diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) (blocking non-CFTR-Cl − channels) was added to the mucosal compartment. After 10 min, 500 μM histamine (to stimulate Ca 2+ and proteinkinase Cmediated CFTR Cl − secretion) was added to the serosal compartment (ΔI sc, histamine ). In the open circuit, the final transepithelial voltage and final resistance were measured by applying short current pulses as in the beginning. Preliminary data suggested that the average ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine is the best diagnostic ICM parameter for chloride secretory response (ICM CFTR response), but reference ranges have not been established [10] . Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (normally distributed variables), respective the median values, and 25th and 75th percentiles (nonnormally distributed variables). Group comparisons were performed using the Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test for normally or non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (release 21; IBM, Armonk, USA). Our study included 18 patients with CF and 13 healthy controls with a median age of 20.5 and 25.0 years, respectively (NS) ( Table 1 ). As consequence of our inclusion criteria, sweat chloride values distinguish patients with CF from healthy controls (p < 0.001). Although the mean sweat chloride differed between CF-PS and CF-PI patients (p = 0.003), an individual overlap occurs (Table 1, Figure 1 ). The mean NPD CFTR response significantly discriminated between CF patients and healthy controls (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS versus PI (Table 1 ). Four healthy controls had an average Δ0Cl − + Iso of > −7.7 mV. Three out of four controls had a repeatable average NPD CFTR response in the CF-range for Δ0Cl − + Iso > −7.7 mV (23% of all healthy controls) (Figure 1 ), and two additional controls when using the Wilschanski score (15% of all healthy controls) (Figure 2 ). All these healthy controls were smokers. CFTR genotyping was offered to these three healthy controls as part of clinical routine and none had two CF-causing mutations (Table 1) . For ICM a median of 6 (5-7) rectal biopsies were sampled per patient without severe adverse events. The mean ICM CFTR response was significantly different between CF patients and healthy controls (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS versus those who were PI (Table 1) . We could not detect any age-dependency of the response to Isoproterenol/Forskolin. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap between CF-patients and controls (Figures 3  and 4 ). Using the best instead of the average NPD, the CFTR response overlap did not change (Additional file 1). Using the best instead of the average ICM, the CFTR response resulted in one overlap (Additional file 2). In healthy controls, smoking had no influence on sweat chloride (NS), but decreased CFTR function as measured by NPD (p = 0.049) ( Table 2 and Figure 5 ), Figure 3 Correlation between the average ΔIsc (forskolin/IBMX + carbachol + histamine) (ICM) and average Δ0Cl − + Iso (NPD). The normal range is shown left of the dotted line. The intermediate range is shown between the solid and dotted lines. A higher ΔIsc (forskolin/ IBMX + carbachol + histamine) represents a better CFTR response. and resulted in intermediate or even abnormal NPD results, but not ICM or sweat chloride results. There is a trend in ICM measurements indicative that smoking might not only affect CFTR in the respiratory tract, but also in the intestine (Table 2 and Figure 6 ). ICM is superior to NPD for distinguishing between CF patients with a sweat chloride >60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM diffe rentiated patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD, and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD. There is a trend in ICM indicative that smoking might not only affect CFTR in the respiratory tract, but also in the intestine, which has no impact on diagnostic interpretation. NPD has been used as a diagnostic test for CF since the late 1980s [14, 21, 22] . Studies have shown 94.8-100% sensitivity and 96.5-100% specificity of Δ0Cl − + Iso for separating PI patients with CF from healthy controls [13, 14, 23] . Experience with a broader spectrum of patients with CF [24, 25] and equivocal patients (sweat chloride <60 mmol/l and less than two CF-causing mutations) [20] described a clinically relevant overlap for Δ0Cl − + Iso. Even in F508del homozygous patients, a residual CFTR NPD response with [26] or without [27, 28] an observed clinical difference has been described. Some centers introduced an intermediate category for Δ0Cl − + Iso [6] , interpret the highest NPD CFTR response [29] , or use a composite score that includes sodium and chloride conductance [20, 30] . Irrespective of the diagnostic criteria, our result showed a clinically relevant overlap between patients with CF and healthy controls. A normal average NPD CFTR response excludes CF, but an abnormal average NPD CFTR response could occur in healthy controls, especially in smokers, and can lead to a false-positive diagnosis of CF. A repeated measurement of a pathologic NPD response reduced the falsepositive results in 1 out of 4 healthy controls in our cohort and should be recommended as a standard approach. ICM was developed as a research tool for CFTR function in the 1990s [31] and has been used as a diagnostic test since the early 2000s [15, 32] . Two different protocols are established; the Freiburg protocol [9] and the original [33] and adapted [34] Rotterdam protocol. We used the newest ECFS-ICM-SOP, which is an adapted Rotterdam protocol. The combination of cAMP-mediated Cl − secretion, and the carbachol and histamine (Rotterdam protocol) responses separate patients with CF from those without CF [11, 12, 34] , but not patients with CF who are PS from those who are PI [11, 12] , which is in accordance with our results. The 50% loss of CFTR protein in CF heterozygotes could not be detected by ICM [35] independent of the protocol [15, 32] . For the Rotterdam protocol, De Jonge postulated that the ICM response is not proportional to the CFTR amount in the apical membrane of coloncytes except at a low level (<10-15%) and could therefore only detect an 80-85% loss of CFTR expression/ function [32] . Therefore, mild mutations could result in a false-negative ICM. Interestingly, Derichs reported 8 patients with a sweat chloride >60 mmol/l, fewer than two CF-causing mutations after sequencing, and a normal ICM response who were judged as CF unlikely [12] . Our results with the new ECFS-ICM SOP confirm the high predictive value and practicability of this adapted ICM Rotterdam protocol. Our data suggest that NPD is more likely to detect CFTR dysfunction in healthy controls than the ICM or sweat test. This could be explained by tissue specific differences in CFTR expression, alternative chloride channel expression, or extrinsic factors. Kälin et al. showed identical CFTR expression in the respiratory and intestinal tract of F508del-homozygous patients and healthy controls [36] . Highly variable CFTR expression in the nose [37] and colon [38] of F508del homozygous patients has been described, varying from 0-100% [37] . Therefore, in the respiratory and intestinal tract, individual CFTR expression seems to be more relevant than tissue specific expression. Alternative chloride channels could contribute to the chloride conductance, but have not been described in the distal colon [39] . Furthermore, previous infections [40] , milder trauma [14] , smoking [17] , increased paracellular permeability [41] , and decreased CFTR expression [42] and CFTR response [43] . With the exception of smoking, these extrinsic factors are relevant only for NPD, but not for rectal biopsies [44] . Smoking causes a decreased NPD response [17] , but although a decreased systemic CFTR function mediated by acrolein [18] . Raju et al. demonstrated a 65% decrease in the ICM CFTR response in healthy smokers compared with non-smokers [18] . Our results confirm these findings. In contrast to NPD, smoking did not influence the diagnostic cut-off for ICM in our cohort. Therefore, ICM seems to be a more robust diagnostic test than NPD to distinguish primary from secondary CFTR dysfunction.

         "The Importance of Bacterial and Viral Infections Associated with Adult Asthma Exacerbations in Clinical Practice",
         "BACKGROUND: Viral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. METHODS: The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients. H. influenzae was observed in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients. CONCLUSION: Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.",

         "Inhaled antigens including house dust mite are known to be the major cause of asthma exacerbation. Other triggers are cold air, smoking, drinking alcohol, exercise, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and viral infection [1] [2] [3] [4] . Several viral infections induce asthma exacerbation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are known to be major causes of asthma exacerbations in children [5] [6] [7] . Infection with these viruses in infants was associated with a higher incidence of asthma onset [8, 9] . The prevalence of virus detection in adult asthmatic exacerbation was reported to the range of 41-78% [10] . Among these viruses, HRV infection is a frequent cause of exacerbations in adults with asthma and a cold [11] HRV infection causes asthma due to its potential for a Th2-biased response [12, 13] . Influenza virus (IF) infection also induces asthma attacks in adults [10, 14] . The prevalence of IF infection with asthmatic exacerbation in adults is higher than that in children [10] . However, whether other viruses induce asthma exacerbations in adults remains unknown. There are few reports regarding the relationships between asthma attacks and bacterial infections [1-4, 15, 16] . Infection with atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetti, has been reported to be related to asthma attacks [17] [18] [19] . However, it is controversial whether the atypical bacteria are truly related with adult asthmatic exacerbation or not [10] . On in vitro examination, many viruses and bacteria are capable of activating several allergic inflammatory cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, bronchial epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Mast cells express toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on their surface [20] . TLR4 is a receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as a major receptor for RSV [21] . After stimulation of TLR4 ligands, mast cells induce a subset of genes that include a Th2 cytokine and chemokines that recruit Th2 cells and eosinophils [20] . Eosinophils express TLR7 and TLR8 [22] . TLR7 activation inhibits viral replication in the lung and prevents virus-induced airway hyperreactivity [23] . Bronchial epithelial cells express ICAM-1, which is upregulated by HRV infection [24, 25] . Smooth muscle cells express functional TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and NOD1 with induction of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF release and upregulation of ICAM-1 by HRV infection [26, 27] . Previous studies regarding asthma and infection in uncomplicated asthmatic patients have been limited. Patients with comorbid pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are excluded from usual clinical asthma studies. In our previous reports, 11.3% of asthmatics were found to have COPD in clinical practice [28] . The incidence of pneumonia is usually high in asthmatic patients. In the present study, the associations between several infections and adult asthma exacerbations were evaluated in clinical practice. A total of 50 adult inpatients with asthma attacks with or without comorbid pneumonia or COPD were recruited. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from these patients, and several viral and bacterial infections were detected by multiplex PCR analysis. A comprehensive analysis to examine the relation of various infections on adult asthma exacerbation in clinical practice was performed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients were aged over 18 years and had a clinical diagnosis of asthma supported by one or more other characteristics: variability in peak expiratory flow of more than 20%; airway reversibility by inhaled β2 agonist; hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge; and recurrent dyspnea episodes with wheezing. Fifty-five adult asthmatic patients were admitted to our hospital due to asthma exacerbations from May 2011 to December 2012. Asthmatic inpatients who were admitted to our hospital for other disease or who did not require systemic steroid treatment were excluded. Among 55 patients, 50 asthmatics were enrolled in this study with written informed consent. In comparison 20 stable asthmatic patients without any asthmatic attack in previous one year were recruited from the outpatient clinic in our hospital. These patients had no recent common cold in previous 2 weeks. Multiplex PCR analysis to detect 15 major respiratory viruses and 5 bacteria was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs taken from these patients. In brief, the nasopharyngeal swab was taken from each patient as soon as possible after hospital admission. The nasopharyngeal swab was dipped in PBS buffer, and the appropriate volume of RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) solution for extraction of RNA was added. Multiplex PCR was performed using these samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (RV15OneStepACE Detection kit and PneumoBacter ACE Detection kit, SeeGene, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The PCR products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. At the same time, the sputum culture from patients was performed for detection of bacterial infection. Differences between two groups were assessed using Pearson's χ 2 test, Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney's U test. Additional analysis was conducted by multiple logistic regression model. Data analyses were performed with SPSS statistics version 17.0.0 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Fifty patients were admitted to our hospital for asthma exacerbations. These patients' characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Their mean age was 57.9 years, and the average duration of asthma was 20.6 years. Eighty percent of the patients were atopic, 34% were non-smokers, and current smokers accounted for 36%. The comorbidities of the patients included sinusitis (32%), COPD (16%), and pneumonia (6%). The patients had poor asthma control (ACQ 3.7 ± 1.2) with high exhaled NO levels (FeNO 51.7 ± 47.6 ppb). Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had higher incidences of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, and pneumonia. There was no difference in the pathogen detection rate between inpatients and outpatients (Table 1) . Of the 50 asthma exacerbation inpatients, 48 suffered an asthma exacerbation after a common cold (fever, sore throat, or rhinorrhea) in previous one week, indicating that the respiratory infection rather than the human respiratory colonization was usually observed prior to asthma exacerbation. The nasopharyngeal swab collection in these patients was performed within one week (average 4.4 days) after a common cold. The numbers of patients with viral infections, bacterial infections, both viral and bacterial infections, and no pathogen were 16 (33.3%), 9 (18.8%), 9 (18.8%), and 14 (29.2%), respectively (Fig 1) . The dominant viruses were HRV A/B/ C, RSV A, influenza A virus, and metapneumovirus (Table 2 ). Several simultaneous virus infections were detected in some patients: 3 viruses in 3 patients and 2 viruses in 3 patients. The method of bacterial detection was sputum culture (20.8%), multiplex PCR (41.7%) and both (37.5%), respectively. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Table 2) . Several simultaneous bacterial infections were detected in a few patients: 3 bacteria in 1 patient, and 2 bacteria in 2 patients. Furthermore, co-infections of virus and bacteria were detected in 9 patients with no associations with specific viruses and specific bacteria ( Table 2) . Compared to pathogen-free patients, the infected patients were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, higher IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, and pneumonia (Table 3 ). There were no differences between the two groups in lymphocyte counts, CD4 absolute counts, and immunoglobulin levels (data not shown). After intensive treatment of the asthma exacerbation for one month, ACQ and FeNO levels decreased without any difference between the 2 groups. Compared to virus-free patients, the virus-detected patients were non-atopic type and high IgE titers (Table 3 ). Compared to bacteria-free patients, the bacteria-detected patients were high incidence of comorbid sinusitis and pneumonia (Table 3) . There was no difference in the pathogen detection rate between inpatients and outpatients ( Table 1) . Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, and higher incidences of HRV A/ B/C, RSV A, and metapneumovirus infections were observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients (Table 4 ). H. influenzae was observed even in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria other than H. influenzae, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients (Table 4 ). The recent asthma studies demonstrated the relationship between viral infections and the development of asthma [1, 2] . Even in the recent guidelines, there is few description of the association between bacterial infection and asthma [1] [2] [3] . In this study, infection with S. pneumoniae was the risk factor for adult asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. The current guideline was developed using an evidence-based medicine analysis, which utilized several clinical studies. Patients with a heavy smoking history or comorbid COPD or pneumonia were usually excluded in almost all of the clinical asthma studies. However, many asthmatic inpatients have a history of heavy smoking and some have comorbid COPD or pneumonia in clinical practice. The results of the present study are useful for many practicing clinicians because the patients in the present study were not all non-smoking uncomplicated asthmatics. It was found that viral infection, especially with IF, RSV, and HRV, was important for asthma exacerbation. These results are consistent with previous reports [5] [6] [7] 14] . Surprisingly, viruses were detected by multiplex PCR analysis in half of the stable asthmatic outpatients, indicating that several viruses were the common human respiratory microbes. Compared to stable asthmatic outpatients, higher incidences of HRV, RSV, and metapneumovirus infections were observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients, indicating that viral infection, especially with HRV, RSV, or metapneumovirus, plays an important role in adult asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Prevention of infections with these viruses is important for decreasing asthma exacerbations in clinical practice. The relationship between viral infection and asthma exacerbation may be explained by TLR or ICAM-1 [20, 21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , but a higher incidence of smoking may affect viral infection in asthmatic patients in clinical practice. Bacterial infection has not been the focus of previous studies of asthma exacerbation because patients who smoked or had COPD were usually completely excluded in usual clinical asthma studies. In the present study, there was a relationship between bacterial infection and asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Considering the results of this practical, clinical study, comorbid sinusitis may be the most important factor related to susceptibility to bacterial infection in asthmatic patients. The presence of comorbid pneumonia may also affect the susceptibility of asthmatic patients to bacterial infection. Although S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis are the major bacterial infections in the respiratory tract, only H. influenzae was detected from stable asthmatic outpatients. These results indicate that bacteria other than H. influenzae contributed to asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Early treatment with antibiotics, as well as steroid and bronchodilators, may be required for treatment of asthma exacerbation in these patients. It is important for clinicians to detect and treat bacterial infections in patients with asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. In the view point of the prevention of bacterial infection, pneumococcal vaccination is most important for asthmatic patients. Co-infections with virus and bacteria were observed in 18.8% of asthma attack patients in this study. Wark et al. reported that the viral and bacterial co-infections increased the risk of readmission in asthmatic and COPD patients [14] . This is an important issue when taking care of these asthmatic patients. The exacerbation group had a higher number of smokers versus the stable asthmatics in our study. The mechanism of this result may be explained by steroid resistance (via the histone deacetylase 2 pathway or overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor β) in severe smoking asthma. [29, 30] There are some limitations in this study. Although 98% of asthma exacerbation inpatients had a history of a common cold before their asthma attack, a pathogen was detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in only 70% of patients. Overall, 15 major viruses and 6 major bacteria were evaluated by multiplex PCR analysis. It is possible that other minor pathogens may be involved in asthma exacerbations in clinical practice. Another possible reason for the low yield is inappropriate timing of the taking of nasal swabs. The pathogen causing the common cold may have disappeared at the time the nasal swab was taken in some patients. Another reason is that some patients may have only had a lower respiratory tract infection. The symptom from the patients with allergic rhinitis may be misinterpreted as being due to a respiratory infection. Furthermore, this study is not a result from longitudinal data. We checked the microbes only once on admission. If we check the microbes several times, we can clearly elucidate whether the detected microbe is infection or colonization. Several pathogens were different between stable outpatients and asthma exacerbation inpatients. However, only the detection rate of S. pneumoniae was statisitically significant because the number of stable outpatients was too small compared to asthma exacerbation inpatients. If we could get the larger number of outpatients, other pathogen may be related to asthma exacerbation. In conclusion, several viral and bacterial infections were observed in patients with asthma attacks in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation. In the future, a fast and easy method for the detection of pathogens is required for early treatment of viral or bacterial infections in asthma exacerbation inpatients.",
         "The Importance of Bacterial and Viral Infections Associated with Adult Asthma Exacerbations in Clinical Practice. BACKGROUND: Viral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. METHODS: The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients. H. influenzae was observed in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients. CONCLUSION: Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.. Inhaled antigens including house dust mite are known to be the major cause of asthma exacerbation. Other triggers are cold air, smoking, drinking alcohol, exercise, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and viral infection [1] [2] [3] [4] . Several viral infections induce asthma exacerbation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are known to be major causes of asthma exacerbations in children [5] [6] [7] . Infection with these viruses in infants was associated with a higher incidence of asthma onset [8, 9] . The prevalence of virus detection in adult asthmatic exacerbation was reported to the range of 41-78% [10] . Among these viruses, HRV infection is a frequent cause of exacerbations in adults with asthma and a cold [11] HRV infection causes asthma due to its potential for a Th2-biased response [12, 13] . Influenza virus (IF) infection also induces asthma attacks in adults [10, 14] . The prevalence of IF infection with asthmatic exacerbation in adults is higher than that in children [10] . However, whether other viruses induce asthma exacerbations in adults remains unknown. There are few reports regarding the relationships between asthma attacks and bacterial infections [1-4, 15, 16] . Infection with atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetti, has been reported to be related to asthma attacks [17] [18] [19] . However, it is controversial whether the atypical bacteria are truly related with adult asthmatic exacerbation or not [10] . On in vitro examination, many viruses and bacteria are capable of activating several allergic inflammatory cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, bronchial epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Mast cells express toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on their surface [20] . TLR4 is a receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as a major receptor for RSV [21] . After stimulation of TLR4 ligands, mast cells induce a subset of genes that include a Th2 cytokine and chemokines that recruit Th2 cells and eosinophils [20] . Eosinophils express TLR7 and TLR8 [22] . TLR7 activation inhibits viral replication in the lung and prevents virus-induced airway hyperreactivity [23] . Bronchial epithelial cells express ICAM-1, which is upregulated by HRV infection [24, 25] . Smooth muscle cells express functional TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and NOD1 with induction of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF release and upregulation of ICAM-1 by HRV infection [26, 27] . Previous studies regarding asthma and infection in uncomplicated asthmatic patients have been limited. Patients with comorbid pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are excluded from usual clinical asthma studies. In our previous reports, 11.3% of asthmatics were found to have COPD in clinical practice [28] . The incidence of pneumonia is usually high in asthmatic patients. In the present study, the associations between several infections and adult asthma exacerbations were evaluated in clinical practice. A total of 50 adult inpatients with asthma attacks with or without comorbid pneumonia or COPD were recruited. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from these patients, and several viral and bacterial infections were detected by multiplex PCR analysis. A comprehensive analysis to examine the relation of various infections on adult asthma exacerbation in clinical practice was performed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients were aged over 18 years and had a clinical diagnosis of asthma supported by one or more other characteristics: variability in peak expiratory flow of more than 20%; airway reversibility by inhaled β2 agonist; hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge; and recurrent dyspnea episodes with wheezing. Fifty-five adult asthmatic patients were admitted to our hospital due to asthma exacerbations from May 2011 to December 2012. Asthmatic inpatients who were admitted to our hospital for other disease or who did not require systemic steroid treatment were excluded. Among 55 patients, 50 asthmatics were enrolled in this study with written informed consent. In comparison 20 stable asthmatic patients without any asthmatic attack in previous one year were recruited from the outpatient clinic in our hospital. These patients had no recent common cold in previous 2 weeks. Multiplex PCR analysis to detect 15 major respiratory viruses and 5 bacteria was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs taken from these patients. In brief, the nasopharyngeal swab was taken from each patient as soon as possible after hospital admission. The nasopharyngeal swab was dipped in PBS buffer, and the appropriate volume of RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) solution for extraction of RNA was added. Multiplex PCR was performed using these samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (RV15OneStepACE Detection kit and PneumoBacter ACE Detection kit, SeeGene, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The PCR products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. At the same time, the sputum culture from patients was performed for detection of bacterial infection. Differences between two groups were assessed using Pearson's χ 2 test, Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney's U test. Additional analysis was conducted by multiple logistic regression model. Data analyses were performed with SPSS statistics version 17.0.0 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Fifty patients were admitted to our hospital for asthma exacerbations. These patients' characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Their mean age was 57.9 years, and the average duration of asthma was 20.6 years. Eighty percent of the patients were atopic, 34% were non-smokers, and current smokers accounted for 36%. The comorbidities of the patients included sinusitis (32%), COPD (16%), and pneumonia (6%). The patients had poor asthma control (ACQ 3.7 ± 1.2) with high exhaled NO levels (FeNO 51.7 ± 47.6 ppb). Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had higher incidences of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, and pneumonia. There was no difference in the pathogen detection rate between inpatients and outpatients (Table 1) .

         "Effect of cadmium on the expression levels of interleukin-1α and interleukin-10 cytokines in human lung cells",
         "Cadmium is an environmentally hazardous metal, which causes toxicity in humans. Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl(2) compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl(2) concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl(2) concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl(2) affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.",

         "Cadmium is a hazardous environmental pollutant with economic value, however no known biological function. It is an industrial toxicant, which has been classified as a type I carcinogen (1, 2) . It is a highly reactive metal and complexes with ligands to form different compounds, which affect numerous biological molecules and organs (3) . A significant quantity of cadmium is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic activities, including copper and nickel smelting, electroplating, galvanizing, nickel-cadmium battery production, welding, phosphate fertilizers, sewage sludge and cigarette smoke (3, 4) . The toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5, 6) . Cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7, 8) . Although the level of cadmium exposure to humans is low, it can accumulate and remain in the system for 15-30 years (9) (10) (11) , which is responsible for the toxicity in various organs. Cadmium molecular toxicity has been associated with various diseases, including tumor formation. Our previous study investigated cadmium toxicity and the protective effect of different antioxidant or chelating compounds, which reduce the toxic effect of cadmium in liver cells (12) (13) (14) (15) . Inhalation is one of the predominant causes of cadmium exposure in humans and it has been reported to cause chronic inflammation and is responsible for various lung diseases (16) (17) (18) (19) . Cytokines are the predominant mediators of inflammation. Interleukin (IL)-1α is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, which regulates the expression levels of other cytokines and chemokines (20) (21) (22) . Conversely, cells respond to various toxic insults by secreting different anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, for defense and repair mechanisms (23) . The aim of the present study was to measure the expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines and to determine the viability of normal and cancerous human lung cells treated with various concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) for different incubation periods in order to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. The IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines were selected as they were significantly upregulated following treatment with 75 µM CdCl 2 after 24 h in our previous study using human A549 cancer cells (24) . Chemicals. The F12 K medium, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution (100X), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA solution (1X), amphotericin B (1,000X), phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, CdCl 2 , 25% glutaraldehyde and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The human IL-10 (cat. no. ELH-IL10-001) and human IL-1α (cat. no. ELH-IL1alpha-001) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Ray Biotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA, USA). Maintenance of the cell lines. The human MRC-9 normal lung (cat. no. CCL-212) and human A549 lung cancer (cat. no. CCL-185) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The supplied frozen cells were cultured, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were grown in 10 ml minimum essential medium (American Type Culture Collection) (MRC-9) or F12K (A549) medium, containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.025 µg/ml amphotericin B and 10% FBS in T-75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator (Nuaire Co., Plymouth, MN, USA). Crystal violet viability test. The viability test was performed as previously reported (25) . Briefly, to investigate the effect of CdCl 2 on the viability of the cells, ~1x10 5 A549 lung cancer cells or 5x10 4 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and allowed to stabilize overnight in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. The cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 µM CdCl 2 in a final volume of 1 ml in triplicate wells and were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Following incubation, the viability of the cells was measured. The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) value was calculated from the LD 50 graph where the two lines meet, according to a previous study (26) . Preparation of cell extracts. A total of ~3.9x10 6 A549 lung cancer cells or 1.95x10 6 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into T-75 cm 2 flasks in complete medium. Each cell line was treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 in triplicate flasks for various durations (0, 6, 12, 18 or 24 h) and were incubated at 37˚C at 5% CO 2 . At the end of each treatment period, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 1,350 x g for 5 min. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) lysis buffer, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, by homogenization in a vial on ice three times for 10 sec using a polytron homogenizer (Pro Scientific, Inc., Oxford, CT, USA). The homogenate was subsequently transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,740 x g for 10 min at 4˚C to remove the lysed cell membrane debris. The supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and the cell lysates were stored at -20˚C for cytokine analysis. Protein estimation. The protein concentration of the cell lysates were determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. The protein standards and working reagents were prepared, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In triplicate eppendorf tubes, 25 µl standard or lysate sample were added. The working reagent (500 µl) was added to each tube, incubated at 37˚C for 30 min and was subsequently measured at 562 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). The concentration of the lysate samples were determined using the standard curve. ELISA. The human IL-1α and IL-10 ELISA kits were purchased from Ray Biotech Inc. and used for the quantitative measurement of the expression levels of the cytokines in human lung cells. The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the color in the 96-well plate was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader (EL 800; Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Statistical analysis. The viability and cytokine assay results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3). All CdCl 2 -treated cell data are presented as a percentage value compared with the untreated control cells (100%). The data were analyzed for significance by Dunnet's multiple comparison test, using GraphPad Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Effect of CdCl 2 on the cell viability of human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 cancer cells. The viability of the normal and cancerous lung cells exposed to various CdCl 2 concentrations was demonstrated to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1) . The viability of the normal lung MRC-9 cells was reduced by 6, 11, 11, 44, 55, 60 and 75% (Fig. 1A) , while the viability of the A594 lung cancer cells was decreased by 13, 36, 42, 58, 65, 76 and 81% ( (Fig. 2) . The cytokine levels decreased with increasing concentration and duration (Fig. 2) . The results clearly demonstrated that normal MRC-9 lung cells responded to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 with high expression levels of the cytokines in the lysate at early time points and high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 demonstrated toxic effects on the expression levels of the cytokines. Fig. 3 , the expression levels of IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines in the A549 lung cancer cells treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 concentrations for 6, 12, 18 or 24 h were detected. The lung cancer cells treated with 50 µM CdCl 2 for 12 h demonstrated the maximum expression of each cytokine, and the expression levels decreased as the duration of exposure and concentration of CdCl 2 increased (Fig. 3) . The results clearly demonstrated the response of the A549 lung cancer cells to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 , with high expression of cytokines at high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 , demonstrating the toxic effect on the expression of cytokines. The widespread industrial usage of cadmium presents a health risk directly and indirectly to humans and other living organisms. Industrial waste fumes, burning of fossil fuels and cigarette smoke are the predominant direct sources of cadmium exposure to humans. It is estimated that 90% of the inhaled cadmium particles are absorbed by lung tissue and cause pulmonary damage, emphysema and lung cancer (16) (17) (18) (19) . Organisms respond to xeno-biotics via inflammation and it is initiated through various signaling molecules, including cytokines, in the cells. To date, few investigations into the expression levels of the cytokines, IL-1α (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory), have been reported (27) . Therefore, elucidating the expression levels of IL-1α and IL-10, and the cell viability at various CdCl 2 concentrations and incubation durations in human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 lung cancer cells may provide an understanding of how lung cells response to cadmium toxicity. The results indicated that A549 lung cancer cells were observed to be more sensitive to CdCl 2 compared with the MRC-9 normal lung cells. The difference in their sensitivities was reflected in their LD 50 values. The LD 50 of CdCl 2 for the normal MRC-9 lung cells was 112.5 µM, whereas the LD 50 of the lung cancer cells was 87.5 µM (Fig. 1) . A previous study demonstrated that carcinomas contain significantly less  metallothionein compared with their corresponding normal cells (28) . This may be one of the contributing factors for the higher sensitivity of cancer cells to cadmium toxicity, however, further investigation is required to prove this hypothesis. Normal lung cells and the lung cancer cells revealed high expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines following treatment with CdCl 2 (Figs. 1 and 2) . In a previous study (29) , a significant increase in IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines was observed in the tested cells, when human-derived bronchial epithelium was exposed to tobacco smoke components. Furthermore, other previous studies have revealed that cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation, to activate the cytokine network and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (30, 31) . The higher expression of cytokines, which lead to inflammation, may be responsible for the later cytotoxic effects in the cells, which lead to a decrease in viability, as observed in the present study (Fig. 1 ). This is supported by a previous study (32) demonstrating that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to cadmium exposure cause pathological conditions in a biological system. When the cytokine levels were compared in the normal lung cells, a higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α, was observed compared with the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, at 6 h exposure (Fig. 2) . A high level of IL-1α cytokine in the cells exposed to xeno-biotics has been reported to inhibit the expression of metallothionein protein (33) . In that previous study, IL-1α inhibited the mRNA expression of metallothionein in endometrial stromal cells and amniotic cells treated with CdCl 2 . Based on the above report, the present study hypothesized that increased levels of IL-1α may reduce the protein expression of metallothionein, which in turn leads to the increase in unbound CdCl 2 in the cell, which may now damage biological molecules, including proteins, as shown by the decreased expression of IL-1α and IL-10 observed in the present study (Fig. 2) . The expression pattern of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines from the A549 cancer lung cells was different compared with the normal lung cells. The maximum levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines were observed at a later period (12 h, Fig. 3 ) in the lung cancer cells compared with the normal cells (6 h, Fig. 2 ). In addition, it was also observed that each cytokine was highly expressed in cancer cells compared with the normal cells treated with CdCl 2 (Figs. 2 and 3) . A similar observation was observed when the cytokine levels of patients with cancer were compared with the cytokine levels of normal individuals (34) . The delayed expression and higher expression levels of the cytokines observed in cancer cells may be as a result of the malfunction of the cell regulatory mechanisms commonly observed in cancer cells. Lung cancer cells demonstrated higher expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, compared with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α (Fig. 3) . This was consistent with our previously reported findings (24) and another previous study (35) . IL-10 acts as anti-inflammatory cytokine and is also responsible for cell death. IL-10 cytokine has been demonstrated to decrease the translocation of nuclear factor-κB, which is important in increasing apoptotic markers, which later leads to apoptotic cell death (31) . Therefore, the higher levels of IL-10 cytokine in the A549 lung cancer cells may be one of the reasons for the higher cytotoxicity caused by CdCl 2 (Fig. 1) . In the present study, higher cadmium concentrations (100 and 150 µM) decreased the expression levels of the cytokines in the normal and cancer cells (Figs. 2 and 3) . Higher concentrations of cadmium induced higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which degrade macromolecules, including proteins and DNA (12, 13, 36) . The low expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines in each cell line may also be linked to the toxic effect of unbound cadmium in the cells, as a result of the lack of metallothionein protein. This result is consistent with a previous study, which reported inhibition of the expression of IL-1α in rat hepatocytes following treatment with high concentrations of CdCl 2 (32) . In addition, longer exposure durations may also be a factor in causing higher toxicity, as decreased expression of cytokines were observed with increased incubation durations in the present study (Figs. 2 and 3) . The longer exposure duration led to the accumulation of cadmium inside of the cell, which in turn causes decreased cytokine levels leading to cell death. In conclusion, the viability result revealed that human A549 lung cancer cells exhibited higher sensitivity to CdCl 2 compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. Furthermore,  the cells demonstrated a differential expression of the cytokines in response to CdCl 2 . The maximum cytokine levels were observed in the normal MRC-9 lung cells at an early incubation time (6 h) compared with the lung cancer cells (12 h) , demonstrating an early immune response of normal lung cells. The present study clearly demonstrated the effect of CdCl 2 on the expression levels of cytokines in lung cells and suggested that compounds, which activate the cytokines and reduce inflammation, may prevent cadmium toxicity.",
         "Effect of cadmium on the expression levels of interleukin-1α and interleukin-10 cytokines in human lung cells. Cadmium is an environmentally hazardous metal, which causes toxicity in humans. Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl(2) compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl(2) concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl(2) concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl(2) affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.. Cadmium is a hazardous environmental pollutant with economic value, however no known biological function. It is an industrial toxicant, which has been classified as a type I carcinogen (1, 2) . It is a highly reactive metal and complexes with ligands to form different compounds, which affect numerous biological molecules and organs (3) . A significant quantity of cadmium is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic activities, including copper and nickel smelting, electroplating, galvanizing, nickel-cadmium battery production, welding, phosphate fertilizers, sewage sludge and cigarette smoke (3, 4) . The toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5, 6) . Cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7, 8) . Although the level of cadmium exposure to humans is low, it can accumulate and remain in the system for 15-30 years (9) (10) (11) , which is responsible for the toxicity in various organs. Cadmium molecular toxicity has been associated with various diseases, including tumor formation. Our previous study investigated cadmium toxicity and the protective effect of different antioxidant or chelating compounds, which reduce the toxic effect of cadmium in liver cells (12) (13) (14) (15) . Inhalation is one of the predominant causes of cadmium exposure in humans and it has been reported to cause chronic inflammation and is responsible for various lung diseases (16) (17) (18) (19) . Cytokines are the predominant mediators of inflammation. Interleukin (IL)-1α is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, which regulates the expression levels of other cytokines and chemokines (20) (21) (22) . Conversely, cells respond to various toxic insults by secreting different anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, for defense and repair mechanisms (23) . The aim of the present study was to measure the expression levels of the IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines and to determine the viability of normal and cancerous human lung cells treated with various concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) for different incubation periods in order to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. The IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines were selected as they were significantly upregulated following treatment with 75 µM CdCl 2 after 24 h in our previous study using human A549 cancer cells (24) . Chemicals. The F12 K medium, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution (100X), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA solution (1X), amphotericin B (1,000X), phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, CdCl 2 , 25% glutaraldehyde and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The human IL-10 (cat. no. ELH-IL10-001) and human IL-1α (cat. no. ELH-IL1alpha-001) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Ray Biotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA, USA). Maintenance of the cell lines. The human MRC-9 normal lung (cat. no. CCL-212) and human A549 lung cancer (cat. no. CCL-185) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The supplied frozen cells were cultured, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were grown in 10 ml minimum essential medium (American Type Culture Collection) (MRC-9) or F12K (A549) medium, containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.025 µg/ml amphotericin B and 10% FBS in T-75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator (Nuaire Co., Plymouth, MN, USA). Crystal violet viability test. The viability test was performed as previously reported (25) . Briefly, to investigate the effect of CdCl 2 on the viability of the cells, ~1x10 5 A549 lung cancer cells or 5x10 4 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and allowed to stabilize overnight in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. The cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 µM CdCl 2 in a final volume of 1 ml in triplicate wells and were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 37˚C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Following incubation, the viability of the cells was measured. The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) value was calculated from the LD 50 graph where the two lines meet, according to a previous study (26) . Preparation of cell extracts. A total of ~3.9x10 6 A549 lung cancer cells or 1.95x10 6 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into T-75 cm 2 flasks in complete medium. Each cell line was treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 in triplicate flasks for various durations (0, 6, 12, 18 or 24 h) and were incubated at 37˚C at 5% CO 2 . At the end of each treatment period, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 1,350 x g for 5 min. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) lysis buffer, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, by homogenization in a vial on ice three times for 10 sec using a polytron homogenizer (Pro Scientific, Inc., Oxford, CT, USA). The homogenate was subsequently transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,740 x g for 10 min at 4˚C to remove the lysed cell membrane debris. The supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and the cell lysates were stored at -20˚C for cytokine analysis. Protein estimation. The protein concentration of the cell lysates were determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. The protein standards and working reagents were prepared, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In triplicate eppendorf tubes, 25 µl standard or lysate sample were added. The working reagent (500 µl) was added to each tube, incubated at 37˚C for 30 min and was subsequently measured at 562 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). The concentration of the lysate samples were determined using the standard curve. ELISA. The human IL-1α and IL-10 ELISA kits were purchased from Ray Biotech Inc. and used for the quantitative measurement of the expression levels of the cytokines in human lung cells. The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the color in the 96-well plate was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader (EL 800; Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Statistical analysis. The viability and cytokine assay results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3). All CdCl 2 -treated cell data are presented as a percentage value compared with the untreated control cells (100%). The data were analyzed for significance by Dunnet's multiple comparison test, using GraphPad Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Effect of CdCl 2 on the cell viability of human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 cancer cells. The viability of the normal and cancerous lung cells exposed to various CdCl 2 concentrations was demonstrated to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1) . The viability of the normal lung MRC-9 cells was reduced by 6, 11, 11, 44, 55, 60 and 75% (Fig. 1A) , while the viability of the A594 lung cancer cells was decreased by 13, 36, 42, 58, 65, 76 and 81% ( (Fig. 2) . The cytokine levels decreased with increasing concentration and duration (Fig. 2) . The results clearly demonstrated that normal MRC-9 lung cells responded to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 with high expression levels of the cytokines in the lysate at early time points and high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 demonstrated toxic effects on the expression levels of the cytokines. Fig. 3 , the expression levels of IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines in the A549 lung cancer cells treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 concentrations for 6, 12, 18 or 24 h were detected. The lung cancer cells treated with 50 µM CdCl 2 for 12 h demonstrated the maximum expression of each cytokine, and the expression levels decreased as the duration of exposure and concentration of CdCl 2 increased (Fig. 3) . The results clearly demonstrated the response of the A549 lung cancer cells to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 , with high expression of cytokines at high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 , demonstrating the toxic effect on the expression of cytokines.

         "Influence of the Pressure Difference and Door Swing on Heavy Contaminants Migration between Rooms",
         "This paper presents the results of investigations whose aim was to describe the influence of the pressure difference level on the ability of contaminants migration between neighbouring rooms in dynamic conditions associated with door swing. The analysis was based on airflow visualization made with cold smoke, which simulated the heavy contaminants. The test room was pressurized to a specific level and then the door was opened to observe the trail of the smoke plume in the plane of the door. The door was opened in both directions: to the positively and negatively pressurized room. This study focuses on the visualization of smoke plume discharge and an uncertainty analysis is not applicable. Unlike other studies which focus on the analysis of pressure difference, the present study looks at the contaminants which are heavier than air and on “pumping out” the contaminants by means of door swing. Setting the proper level of pressure difference between the contaminated room and the neighbouring rooms can prove instrumental in ensuring protection against toxic contaminants migration. This study helped to establish the threshold of pressure difference necessary to reduce migration of heavy contaminants to neighbouring rooms.",

         "An effective and well-designed ventilation system is essential when protection of indoor environment against external conditions is required, and on the premises of special use where hazardous airborne contaminants could be released. Control of contaminants migration between rooms or areas is crucial in both cases. The common strategy to direct the airflow and thus the contaminants transfer is room pressurization. It is widely utilized in chemical or biological laboratories and clean rooms. Room pressurization is also the main method used for the protection of isolation rooms in hospitals. In health care facilities, this way of ventilation system operation is utilized in both the Airborne Infection Isolation and Protective Environment Rooms, however, the key difference is the required direction of airflow between the room and the adjacent space, such as a corridor, which determines the application of negative or positive pressure in the protected room, respectively. Positive pressure ventilation is also designed in operating rooms. There are many different suggestions with regard to the level of pressure difference which should be created to avoid contaminants migration between rooms. Useful information can be found in the guidelines for health services buildings, biological and chemical laboratories, as well as for smoke control systems, but the specific value depends on the local standards, law or recommendations. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention [1] , a minimum pressure difference needed to direct airflow between rooms should be equal to 2.5 Pa. A similar value is recommended by the American Institute of Architects [2] . The UK Department of Health in the best practice guidance for health buildings recommends 5 Pa as a minimum for negative pressure isolation and, instead of a negative pressure in the isolation room, allows a positive pressure of outside corridor of 8-12 Pa (10 Pa nominally) [3] . Guidelines in Taiwan suggest a minimum negative pressure of 8 Pa in relation to the adjacent room or corridor [4] . ASHRAE [5] recommends 12.45 Pa as a value of pressure difference for the rooms of enhanced cleanliness requirements (class), which is confirmed by the study conducted by Ahmed et al. 1993 [6] . Similar guidelines can be found in the Guidance for Industry Sterile Drug Products [7] , where, in the case of clean areas, the value of 10-15 Pa is recommended as a minimum value of pressure difference protecting the room. In the case of protection of aseptic isolations, where it is recommended to achieve complete physical separation from the external environment, the values range from 17.5 to 50 Pa. Some publications refer to the airflow control as a primary means of protection of rooms and thus having an indirect influence on diversification of pressure between adjacent rooms NIH (2003) [8] ; AIA (2001) [2] ; Hitchings (1994) [9] ; Gill (1994) [10] and Coogan [11] . Such publications recommend a range of 126-510 m 3 /h as the difference between the exhausted and supplied air in a contaminated room. However, since the value of the difference of airflow and the generated pressure difference value are closely connected, Streifel (2000) [12] recommends 212 m 3 /h as a difference in the airflow and simultaneously points out 2.5 Pa as a minimum pressure difference necessary to protect rooms and 7.5 Pa as an optimum value. Additionally, Gill [10] presents a minimum velocity on the room leakages at the level of 0.508 m/s. However, all the above guidelines and considerations refer to the steady-state conditions with the doors closed. Another ratio recommended in the guidelines, especially for health care rooms, is the required air change per hour (ACH), which, depending on the source, ranges from 6 to 12 ACH [1, 3] . Research with tracer gas SF 6 conducted by Tung et al. [4] indicates that the ventilation system of negative pressure differential 15.0 Pa in the isolation room demonstrates the best ventilation efficiency to extract contaminants, for both 12 and 24 ACH, which were tested. At lower values of pressure differential the more important factor was ACH, and higher ACH gives better results. can be the case in operating rooms [19, 20] . Door opening immediately causes pressure equilibration between the rooms [21, 15, 22] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that door swinging makes the air mass from both sides blend, especially at the top edge of the door wing, while the difference in the airflow, which protects the rooms when the door is open, is too low to direct the airflow appropriately with the door open [15, 22] . Thus, it was noted that the door should not be opened rapidly. Similar conclusions can be found in [14] where it is pointed out that the negative pressure gradient may have been transiently reversed if the door-opening motion was too rapid, and sliding doors were recommended instead of hinged one. Under the study [15, 22] permanent conditions with the door open were also verified. The limit value, which prevents the air from coming out of the room was the pressure difference at the level of 2 Pa. To compare, the American Industrial Hygiene Association [23] recommends minimum airflow velocity of 0.25 m/s through any opening, including open doorways, and preferred velocity of 0.51 m/s in a desired direction. Airflow through the doorway is also influenced by the air density difference which results from temperature difference between neighbouring rooms [16, 17, 24, 25] . When the temperature difference is high enough, the airflow is directed by the gravity rather than by the pumping effect of door swing [16, 17] . The research described in the available literature, concerning migration of air between rooms in the conditions of pressure difference was conducted using tracer gases, CFD simulations and smoke visualization. It also took into consideration such factors as door operation, temperature difference or ACH level. However, most investigations focused on the general contaminant without taking into account its weight and location in the room. Whenever it is required to protect rooms against migrating contamination, contamination may also contain elements which are heavier than air. In laboratories, these may be chemical compounds connected with the production taking place in the laboratory, while in hospitals these may be anesthetic gases or even aerosols containing hazardous bacteria or viruses. Research on heavy contaminants behaviour is also important due to the fact that among the heavier than air contaminants there are a lot of toxic substances belonging to the group of chemical weapons. [26] . Literature does not define specific requirements for the contaminants heavier than air, apart from the layout of air exhausts (if any). Therefore, in room protection focused design the same pressure difference values are usually used, regardless of the kind, density or weight of the contaminants. In the present paper we focused on heavier-than-air contaminants, accumulated in the lower part of a room. The tests were made with dense smoke visualization in order to investigate the relation between the value of pressure difference, door swing and migration level of heavy contaminants between the rooms. In addition, disturbances in contaminant transfer resulting from movement of a person from a contaminated room to a protected one were also considered. The main method of conducting tests and observation was visualization of contaminated air flow, carried out by means of smoke. The tests were conducted on a suitably prepared testing stand. The measuring stand was configured in a testing room equipped with air-supply/air-exhaust systems (Fig 1) . Both adjacent rooms, where the tests were conducted, had an area of 6x8 m and were 3 m high. They were connected by a single-wing swing door, 2x0.9 m in size. The measuring set-up let us precisely set and monitor the pressure difference between test rooms, measure velocity of the air in the apertures, airflow rate of the air supplied or exhausted from the rooms and visualize the contaminant transfer. A set of measurement series was performed with different values of maintained pressure difference, starting with small values, i.e. 2.5 Pa till 50 Pa used in standard smoke control systems. The main components of the test installation were (Fig 2) : • a device for adjustment and measurement of supply/exhaust airflow rate, adjustment dampers, measuring area reducers and orifice plate, pressure transducers, • simulated source of smoke-the low fog machine, • camera for visualization of smoke transfer with adjustment elements, • lighting for measurement area. The area near the door in both test rooms was lined with black fabric in order to enhance contrast between the smoke and the background. The smoke, generated by the low fog machine, was let in, each time, just above the floor level, at the distance of approx. 1.5 m from the doors. The airflow volume was measured by a system containing a measuring tube (Venturi flow meter) and a pressure transducer. The measuring tube was a standard made element with external diameter of 160mm and measurement accuracy not lower than 5%. The pressure transducer connected with the measuring tube had a measuring range from 0 to 500 Pa, resolution of 1 Pa and measurement accuracy of 0.5%. The airflow volume was calculated as follows: where: k-constant value for the measuring tube, ΔPm-measurement pressure, Pa. The maximum measurement error of the airflow volume V, calculated as an error of a compound value was 5.3%. Positive pressure in the room was measured by means of a pressure transducer with measuring range of 0-100 Pa, resolution of 0.1 Pa and measurement accuracy of 0.5%. During all measurement sessions a constant temperature of 23°C was maintained both in the rooms and in the ventilation system which generated pressure difference. Pressure difference between the rooms provoked air leakage through the air leakage points in the room envelope, and in the closed elements of the ventilation system. Functional relationship between the airflow volume and the pressure difference it generated as well as geometry of the openings, the so called Power law equation, confirmed in numerous sources in the literature, was proposed by ASHRAE in [27] : where: Q-airflow through opening, m 3 /s, c-flow coefficient, m 3 /(s ÁPa n ), n-pressure exponent, [-], Δp-pressure difference across opening, Pa. Exponent (n) and coefficient (c) depend on the kind of openings through which the air passes. The research conducted [28] also proved that the results obtained depend significantly on the geometrical parameters of the openings and on the inflow and outflow of air from the opening. The value of exponent (n) on the basis of tests performed by Walker [29] for the process of air infiltration through the openings, is constant and equals approx.0.6-0.7. Most frequently, exponent (n) has a typical value of 0.65. The value of flow coefficient (c) and that of pressure exponent (n) can be determined empirically by means of appropriate pressure tests. During the tests parameters of the test room were determined, with the door and other openings closed. For this purpose, volume of the airflow supplied to the test room with gradually increasing pressure values was measured. The results of airflow measurements are shown in Table 1 . The above results were approximated by means of the function described in Eq 1. The following relationship was obtained: with correlation coefficient R = 0.998 Adopting a typical coefficient n = 0.65 resulted in a very good representation of room characteristics in the form of the following relationship: with correlation coefficient R = 0.998 Room characteristics are shown in Fig 3. As it can be seen, the test room used in the test has typical characteristics describing leakage. The tests were performed in measurement series with different values of maintained initial level of pressure difference (from low values of approx. 2.5 Pa to the values typically used in desmoking systems, i.e. 50 Pa) and the direction and width of the door swing shown in Tab.2. The testing variants assumed certain behavioural patterns of the users. For this reason, the case of opening and closing the door adjacent to the contaminated area was considered, i.e. a scenario in which a person is looking out of the door in order to assess the situation. For this testing variant, two widths of door swing were taken into account i.e. 10 cm (s = 10) and 50 cm (s = 50). Variant s = 10 was realized at two values of door swing velocity, the so called \"slow\" and \"fast\". Moreover, during the measurement series the influence exerted by movement of a person on the contaminants migration was also taken into consideration. Such a scenario corresponds to the case of \"escape\" from the endangered zone. However, with variants s = 10 and s = 50 the door was opened and then closed while in the escape mode the door was opened to 50 cm and left open after a person transition. The process of opening and closing the door was manual so there could have occurred small differences in velocity and time of its opening. Testing variants used in measurement series are shown in Table 2 . Simulation of contamination was carried out using a low fog machine. During measurements the machine was always placed on the negatively pressurized side, approx. 1.5 m away from the door. Smoke was introduced at the floor level (5 cm above the floor) in a low turbulent manner, so the mixing of smoke with indoor air was limited. The height of smoke layer was about 10-15 cm at the beginning of each test. Temperature of air above the smoke layer in the negative pressure room was equal to the air temperature in the positive pressure room, and no significant temperature gradient was observed in both rooms. The course of a single measurement series was: • closing of the door, • generating appropriate pressure difference, • start-up of a simulated source of contamination (low fog machine), • generating appropriate conditions: opening and closing of the door, \"escape\" mode. Selected results obtained in different measurement series and notes about each series are presented below. Case \"I\" refers to the door opening towards the negatively pressurized zone, while case\"II\" refers to the door opening towards the positively pressurized zone. Descriptions of the series and conclusions were prepared on the basis of visualization and observation of the smoke movement. Temperature during the measurements remained constant, therefore, the influence of the buoyant force on contamination movement through the door can be excluded. The door was opened manually and therefore small differences in velocity and time of door opening may have occurred. However, control measurements showed that these differences would not have been greater than 5%. Figs 4-9 shows the results for cases I and II and pressure difference: 2.5, 12.5 and 25 Pa. In all the cases, with 2.5 Pa pressure difference, a considerable amount of smoke migrated to the adjacent room with the door closed. In the \"escape\" mode, a plume of smoke trailed after With 12.5 Pa, when the door was opened and closed at the width of 10 cm, the smoke practically did not migrate out of the room. At 50 cm wide opening and in the \"escape\" mode, a relatively small amount of smoke remained outside the room. Above the pressure difference of 25 Pa, the smoke practically did not migrate out of the room when the door was opened and closed. Only at 25 Pa, a passage of a person still caused moderate migration of the smoke outside. In all the cases, with pressure difference up to 5 Pa, the smoke remained outside the room after the door was closed. In the \"escape\" mode the smoke trailed after the person leaving the room. A 25 Pa the degree of smoke migration when the door was closed and opened, fell to a moderate level. When a person passed through the door, the smoke practically did not trailed after the person and soon withdrew. Figs 10 and 11 show the results obtained in different series. During the measurement series with the door opened towards a negatively pressurized zone (Fig 10) , in the case of the lowest values of pressure difference (2.5 Pa), a considerable degree of contaminants migration to the Influence of the Pressure Difference and Door Swing on Heavy Contaminants Migration between Rooms room was observed. After closing the door, it was noted that a certain portion of the smoke left migrated further towards an adjacent room or remained at the doorsill. Increased pressure difference (5, 7, 12.5 Pa) between rooms made it possible to arrest smoke in a room when the door was open to the width of 10 and 50 cm. However, a passage of a person through the door resulted in intensive turbulences causing discharge of certain portion of smoke plume outside. When the door was left ajar, the airflow provoked by generating initial pressure difference of 25 Pa, prohibited smoke from getting outside. The same case was noted in previous measurement scenarios. Additionally, like in other cases, also in those conditions, the opening of the door and passage of a person through that door resulted in a small discharge of smoke plume. Initial pressure difference generated at the level of 50 Pa caused a complete blockage of smoke transfer even when a person was passing through the door, not only when the door was partly open. During the measurements conducted with the door directed towards a positive pressure zone (Fig 11) a slightly bigger smoke plume discharge was noted in comparison to the corresponding measurements for the door swing towards negative pressure. Pressurization at the level of 2.5 Pa, 5.0 Pa, irrespective of the width of the door swing, does not prevent migration of the smoke plume outside, which remains in a protected room after the door has been closed. It is only with the door left ajar that a slow withdrawal of smoke plum to a contaminated room was observed. A similar phenomenon was noted during the measurement series with pressure difference of 7.0 and 12.5 Pa; the amount of smoke plume migrating outside was visibly smaller. In comparison to the measurements with lower pressurization, initial generation of pressure difference at 25 Pa noticeably minimizes migration of smoke plume outside, irrespective of the width of the door swing and of a passage of a person through the door. Only minute quantities of smoke migrate. Opening of the door between the rooms of different pressure levelled pressure value on both sides, which was proved by the tests performed, and confirmed in some publications [21, 15, 22] . The studies showed that door swing outside the room towards a positively pressurized zone was more disadvantageous in comparison to the cases when the door was opened into the contaminated room (with negative pressure). With the door opened towards negative pressure, reduction of the amount of contamination to the level specified as moderate or small occurred when the pressure difference was at approx. 7 Pa. That was the case for all the examined modes of door swing (s = 10 fast, s = 10 slow, s = 50, \"escape\" mode). Similar reduction in the amount of contamination in the case of opening of the door towards positive pressure was observed only with the door swing at 12.5 Pa, and even at 25 Pa. This finding is confirmed by the studies of Sansone and Keimig [15] published earlier. The reason for such a phenomenon is the effect of drawing in contamination through the opposite to the leading side of the door opening towards the room with positive pressure and further pushing of the contamination into the room when the door was closed. In the case of door swing towards the negative pressure, the smoke was drawn in through the eddies that formed around the edge of travelling door, but the air passing through the door left ajar made the smoke withdraw. Different observations were recorded by Wiesman in [22] , where the author decided that it is more advantageous to open the door towards the positive pressure. However, his studies assumed only opening of the door in the required direction without closing the door afterwards, which did not take into account the door pumping effect. This effect has a considerable impact on contamination spreading. The studies performed showed that the amount of contamination depends on the velocity of contamination pumping. Faster pumping made more contamination migrate. This was demonstrated by both measurement sessions for cases II 12.5 and 50 Pa carried out in variants s = 10 slow and s = 10 fast, and also by the comparison of the \"escape\" mode and s = 50 mode. In both cases longer time of door swing was connected with a smaller amount of contamination getting out. These observations confirm the conclusions put forward by Sansone and Keimig [15] showing that it is necessary to swing the door more slowly. Door pumping presents a considerable difficulty for the effective protection against contamination migration. The tests show that it causes greater contaminants migration as compared to the door left ajar in stable conditions. The measurements performed showed that in order to protect the rooms against contaminants migration during door pumping, it is necessary to have an airflow ensuring velocity of approx. 0.6-1.0 m/s on the door left ajar. It is a three times greater value in comparison with the values recommended by the AIHA [2] in the case of the door left ajar in stable conditions (0.254m/s). Moreover, measurement results presented in the article indicate that contaminants migration depends on two factors: door pumping and transferring contaminants on the feet of the person passing through the door in the \"escape\" mode. However, with a lower pressure difference and with lower velocity values with the door left ajar, door pumping plays a much bigger role. With the pressure and velocity values growing with the door left ajar, the influence of door pumping decreases, while the contamination is transferred mainly on the person's feet. The presented studies, unlike the other ones which also examine the influence of pressure difference, included the \"pumping\" effect, i.e. transfer of contaminants by means of the door swing. The observations provided the grounds to conclude that the door effect can be a contributing factor to intensification of contaminants transfer, even in comparison to the cases when the door was left open. Although, in terms of contamination, it is more advantageous to swing the door towards negative pressure of 2.5 Pa, as shown in some publications, it is definitely not sufficient in order to protect the rooms if the door swings. Door swinging towards negative pressure causes reduction in the contaminants transfer to the level specified as moderate or small already at the pressure of 7 Pa. The same effect with the door opened in the opposite direction is obtained with pressure difference of 12.5 Pa and even 25 Pa. Increase of pressure difference from 25 to 50 Pa did not help to prevent migration with the door swing towards negative pressure. Moreover, it was shown that quick door swing causes a greater transfer of contaminants regardless of the width of the door opening, which shows that it is necessary to open the door more slowly. In order to protect the rooms against contaminants transfer during door pumping it is necessary to have the airflow which guarantees velocity of approx. 0.6-1.0 m/s on the door left ajar. Contaminants migration is also influenced by their transfer on the feet of the person passing through the door. With an increase in pressure and velocity on the door left ajar, the influence of door swing decreases while the effect on contamination transfer on the feet increases.",
         "Influence of the Pressure Difference and Door Swing on Heavy Contaminants Migration between Rooms. This paper presents the results of investigations whose aim was to describe the influence of the pressure difference level on the ability of contaminants migration between neighbouring rooms in dynamic conditions associated with door swing. The analysis was based on airflow visualization made with cold smoke, which simulated the heavy contaminants. The test room was pressurized to a specific level and then the door was opened to observe the trail of the smoke plume in the plane of the door. The door was opened in both directions: to the positively and negatively pressurized room. This study focuses on the visualization of smoke plume discharge and an uncertainty analysis is not applicable. Unlike other studies which focus on the analysis of pressure difference, the present study looks at the contaminants which are heavier than air and on “pumping out” the contaminants by means of door swing. Setting the proper level of pressure difference between the contaminated room and the neighbouring rooms can prove instrumental in ensuring protection against toxic contaminants migration. This study helped to establish the threshold of pressure difference necessary to reduce migration of heavy contaminants to neighbouring rooms.. An effective and well-designed ventilation system is essential when protection of indoor environment against external conditions is required, and on the premises of special use where hazardous airborne contaminants could be released. Control of contaminants migration between rooms or areas is crucial in both cases. The common strategy to direct the airflow and thus the contaminants transfer is room pressurization. It is widely utilized in chemical or biological laboratories and clean rooms. Room pressurization is also the main method used for the protection of isolation rooms in hospitals. In health care facilities, this way of ventilation system operation is utilized in both the Airborne Infection Isolation and Protective Environment Rooms, however, the key difference is the required direction of airflow between the room and the adjacent space, such as a corridor, which determines the application of negative or positive pressure in the protected room, respectively. Positive pressure ventilation is also designed in operating rooms. There are many different suggestions with regard to the level of pressure difference which should be created to avoid contaminants migration between rooms. Useful information can be found in the guidelines for health services buildings, biological and chemical laboratories, as well as for smoke control systems, but the specific value depends on the local standards, law or recommendations. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention [1] , a minimum pressure difference needed to direct airflow between rooms should be equal to 2.5 Pa. A similar value is recommended by the American Institute of Architects [2] . The UK Department of Health in the best practice guidance for health buildings recommends 5 Pa as a minimum for negative pressure isolation and, instead of a negative pressure in the isolation room, allows a positive pressure of outside corridor of 8-12 Pa (10 Pa nominally) [3] . Guidelines in Taiwan suggest a minimum negative pressure of 8 Pa in relation to the adjacent room or corridor [4] . ASHRAE [5] recommends 12.45 Pa as a value of pressure difference for the rooms of enhanced cleanliness requirements (class), which is confirmed by the study conducted by Ahmed et al. 1993 [6] . Similar guidelines can be found in the Guidance for Industry Sterile Drug Products [7] , where, in the case of clean areas, the value of 10-15 Pa is recommended as a minimum value of pressure difference protecting the room. In the case of protection of aseptic isolations, where it is recommended to achieve complete physical separation from the external environment, the values range from 17.5 to 50 Pa. Some publications refer to the airflow control as a primary means of protection of rooms and thus having an indirect influence on diversification of pressure between adjacent rooms NIH (2003) [8] ; AIA (2001) [2] ; Hitchings (1994) [9] ; Gill (1994) [10] and Coogan [11] . Such publications recommend a range of 126-510 m 3 /h as the difference between the exhausted and supplied air in a contaminated room. However, since the value of the difference of airflow and the generated pressure difference value are closely connected, Streifel (2000) [12] recommends 212 m 3 /h as a difference in the airflow and simultaneously points out 2.5 Pa as a minimum pressure difference necessary to protect rooms and 7.5 Pa as an optimum value. Additionally, Gill [10] presents a minimum velocity on the room leakages at the level of 0.508 m/s. However, all the above guidelines and considerations refer to the steady-state conditions with the doors closed. Another ratio recommended in the guidelines, especially for health care rooms, is the required air change per hour (ACH), which, depending on the source, ranges from 6 to 12 ACH [1, 3] . Research with tracer gas SF 6 conducted by Tung et al. [4] indicates that the ventilation system of negative pressure differential 15.0 Pa in the isolation room demonstrates the best ventilation efficiency to extract contaminants, for both 12 and 24 ACH, which were tested. At lower values of pressure differential the more important factor was ACH, and higher ACH gives better results. can be the case in operating rooms [19, 20] . Door opening immediately causes pressure equilibration between the rooms [21, 15, 22] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that door swinging makes the air mass from both sides blend, especially at the top edge of the door wing, while the difference in the airflow, which protects the rooms when the door is open, is too low to direct the airflow appropriately with the door open [15, 22] . Thus, it was noted that the door should not be opened rapidly. Similar conclusions can be found in [14] where it is pointed out that the negative pressure gradient may have been transiently reversed if the door-opening motion was too rapid, and sliding doors were recommended instead of hinged one. Under the study [15, 22] permanent conditions with the door open were also verified. The limit value, which prevents the air from coming out of the room was the pressure difference at the level of 2 Pa. To compare, the American Industrial Hygiene Association [23] recommends minimum airflow velocity of 0.25 m/s through any opening, including open doorways, and preferred velocity of 0.51 m/s in a desired direction. Airflow through the doorway is also influenced by the air density difference which results from temperature difference between neighbouring rooms [16, 17, 24, 25] . When the temperature difference is high enough, the airflow is directed by the gravity rather than by the pumping effect of door swing [16, 17] . The research described in the available literature, concerning migration of air between rooms in the conditions of pressure difference was conducted using tracer gases, CFD simulations and smoke visualization. It also took into consideration such factors as door operation, temperature difference or ACH level. However, most investigations focused on the general contaminant without taking into account its weight and location in the room. Whenever it is required to protect rooms against migrating contamination, contamination may also contain elements which are heavier than air. In laboratories, these may be chemical compounds connected with the production taking place in the laboratory, while in hospitals these may be anesthetic gases or even aerosols containing hazardous bacteria or viruses. Research on heavy contaminants behaviour is also important due to the fact that among the heavier than air contaminants there are a lot of toxic substances belonging to the group of chemical weapons. [26] . Literature does not define specific requirements for the contaminants heavier than air, apart from the layout of air exhausts (if any). Therefore, in room protection focused design the same pressure difference values are usually used, regardless of the kind, density or weight of the contaminants. In the present paper we focused on heavier-than-air contaminants, accumulated in the lower part of a room. The tests were made with dense smoke visualization in order to investigate the relation between the value of pressure difference, door swing and migration level of heavy contaminants between the rooms.

This finding is confirmed by the studies of Sansone and Keimig [15] published earlier. The reason for such a phenomenon is the effect of drawing in contamination through the opposite to the leading side of the door opening towards the room with positive pressure and further pushing of the contamination into the room when the door was closed. In the case of door swing towards the negative pressure, the smoke was drawn in through the eddies that formed around the edge of travelling door, but the air passing through the door left ajar made the smoke withdraw. Different observations were recorded by Wiesman in [22] , where the author decided that it is more advantageous to open the door towards the positive pressure. However, his studies assumed only opening of the door in the required direction without closing the door afterwards, which did not take into account the door pumping effect. This effect has a considerable impact on contamination spreading. The studies performed showed that the amount of contamination depends on the velocity of contamination pumping. Faster pumping made more contamination migrate. This was demonstrated by both measurement sessions for cases II 12.5 and 50 Pa carried out in variants s = 10 slow and s = 10 fast, and also by the comparison of the \"escape\" mode and s = 50 mode. In both cases longer time of door swing was connected with a smaller amount of contamination getting out. These observations confirm the conclusions put forward by Sansone and Keimig [15] showing that it is necessary to swing the door more slowly. Door pumping presents a considerable difficulty for the effective protection against contamination migration. The tests show that it causes greater contaminants migration as compared to the door left ajar in stable conditions. The measurements performed showed that in order to protect the rooms against contaminants migration during door pumping, it is necessary to have an airflow ensuring velocity of approx. 0.6-1.0 m/s on the door left ajar. It is a three times greater value in comparison with the values recommended by the AIHA [2] in the case of the door left ajar in stable conditions (0.254m/s). Moreover, measurement results presented in the article indicate that contaminants migration depends on two factors: door pumping and transferring contaminants on the feet of the person passing through the door in the \"escape\" mode. However, with a lower pressure difference and with lower velocity values with the door left ajar, door pumping plays a much bigger role. With the pressure and velocity values growing with the door left ajar, the influence of door pumping decreases, while the contamination is transferred mainly on the person's feet. The presented studies, unlike the other ones which also examine the influence of pressure difference, included the \"pumping\" effect, i.e. transfer of contaminants by means of the door swing. The observations provided the grounds to conclude that the door effect can be a contributing factor to intensification of contaminants transfer, even in comparison to the cases when the door was left open. Although, in terms of contamination, it is more advantageous to swing the door towards negative pressure of 2.5 Pa, as shown in some publications, it is definitely not sufficient in order to protect the rooms if the door swings. Door swinging towards negative pressure causes reduction in the contaminants transfer to the level specified as moderate or small already at the pressure of 7 Pa. The same effect with the door opened in the opposite direction is obtained with pressure difference of 12.5 Pa and even 25 Pa. Increase of pressure difference from 25 to 50 Pa did not help to prevent migration with the door swing towards negative pressure. Moreover, it was shown that quick door swing causes a greater transfer of contaminants regardless of the width of the door opening, which shows that it is necessary to open the door more slowly. In order to protect the rooms against contaminants transfer during door pumping it is necessary to have the airflow which guarantees velocity of approx. 0.6-1.0 m/s on the door left ajar. Contaminants migration is also influenced by their transfer on the feet of the person passing through the door. With an increase in pressure and velocity on the door left ajar, the influence of door swing decreases while the effect on contamination transfer on the feet increases.",

         "COPD is characterized by a continuous inflammatory process of the airways, leading to obstruction or limitation of airflow, which is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. 1, 2 However, only 10%-20% of smokers will develop the disease at some day in their life. These data lead to the belief that this disease is due to multiple factors that interact with each other. Among the most prominent are genetic factors that can condition patients to have a certain susceptibility to COPD. For example, deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) (responsible for inhibiting proteases, whose function is to deplete the extracellular matrix) is present in at least 1% of the carriers of the disease in Europe and the United States and other regions around the world such as Africa and Australia. 3 Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and the chemical mediators they produce (cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, growth factors, etc.). For example, neutrophil elastase (NE) is an enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix to facilitate the migration of the neutrophil through the lung parenchyma to the inflammation area. People harboring AAT deficiency alleles have a greater susceptibility to presenting the disease or presenting it at an earlier age. 1, 4 On the other hand, cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL8 (also called IL-8), IL-22, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17F and TGF-β among others are increased in samples from patients with COPD, suggesting an important role in its pathophysiology and in the exacerbations that may occur due Epidemiology COPD is now considered a serious public health problem, reaching the fourth place in mortality worldwide and in Mexico as well. 6, 7 Globally, this disease is present in ~600 million of people, especially in low-and middle-income countries. It is estimated that in 2020, it will rank among the first three causes of death worldwide. 8 COPD and asthma are the airway obstructive pathologies more prevalent. 9 The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a common and treatable disease characterized by the persistent limitation of airflow, which is usually progressive and associated with an increase in the inflammatory response in the airways and in the lungs by harmful particles and gases. 10 Also, this guide defines exacerbations as an acute event characterized by worsening of patient's respiratory symptoms that go beyond daily variations and leads to a change in medication. 6, 10, 48 In addition, the guide also points out that a patient with frequent exacerbating COPD will be considered when he has two or more exacerbations per year, where the best predictor will be the history of previous treatments for exacerbations. 10 Indeed, about half of COPD patients die after 4 years of their first episode of exacerbation. 11 The symptomatology of COPD is diverse, depending on the phenotype (emphysema and chronic bronchitis, the most common). However, there is a range of signs and symptoms that occur more frequently, such as dyspnea of small efforts, chronic cough and increased sputum production. In addition, other clinical data that may appear are hypoxemia, hypercapnia, the so-called \"chest in barrel\" (which appears due to lack of elasticity in the lungs and does not retract properly), weight loss, etc. 6, 10, 48 Molecular mechanisms in COPD Innate immunity COPD is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process caused by tobacco smoke, harmful particles or gases that are capable of activating the cascade of inflammatory reactions that cause tissue destruction in the airways. 5 Pathological changes that are induced as a consequence of chronic exposure to cigarette smoke are observed more early in airway epithelium, which acts as a barrier that protects the lungs from environmental factors and also from .4,000 toxic compounds present in tobacco smoke. 12 Toxic particles contained in the cigarette smoke generate tissue remodeling ( Figure 1 ) as a consequence of the damage they cause to airway epithelium. 13 The most pronounced changes are shortening of the cilia (resulting in less mobility Figure 1 When airway epithelium is exposed to harmful substances, such as those contained in cigarette smoke, it changes its structure. Note: These changes include the loss of close junctions between ciliated epithelial cells, shortening of cilia, hyperplasia of goblet-producing goblet cells and basal cells, in addition to squamous epithelial cell metaplasia.

International Journal of COPD 2017:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations of the mucus produced by goblet cells and less elimination of pathogens), metaplasia (change from one cell type to another, which in normal situations would not be present in a specific tissue) of squamous epithelial cells, hyperplasia of goblet-producing goblet cells and basal cells (a type of cells capable of differentiating into ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cells, caused by the action of growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor [EGF]), in addition to the loss of tight junctions that, under normal conditions, work as an impermeable barrier and protect the respiratory tract from pathogens, xenobiotics and other harmful particles. 9, 13 Once the damage is generated in airway epithelial cells, they secrete chemical mediators (chemokines, cytokines, etc.) in order to generate and maintain an inflammatory response against foreign agents. 5 Cell death produced releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as heat shock proteins, S100 protein and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), 14 which are recognized by extracellular receptors present in neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs; such as Toll-like receptors [TLRs], for example) [15] [16] [17] and trigger an intracellular signaling cascade led by the transcription factors Myd88 and NF-κB that culminate in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18 (a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase 1 and releasing mature forms of various cytokines), 18 which, together with other cytokines (TNF-α, CXCL8, IL-6, among others), are responsible for the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammation zone. Once in the area to which they were recruited, leukocytes (mainly neutrophils and macrophages) release products stored in their granules, such as enzymes responsible for destroying the extracellular matrix (MMP-9, MMP-12, NE), which help their migration through the lung parenchyma but, in turn, generate damage in the lung, thus promoting the progressive reduction of its functionality. 19  Mostly, adaptive immunity appears due to the action of DCs that, in the first instance, pick up the signals of damage of diverse cell types or the antigens that it recognizes as strangers and takes them to the lymph nodes and it is there where it happens the antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules either class I or class II, which results in the differentiation and polarization of T lymphocytes, which recognize the antigen presented by mediated T lymphocyte receptor (T cell receptor [TCR]) ( Figure 2 ). 20, 21 In addition, the production of proinflammatory cytokines is required for this polarization to occur. For example, a microenvironment rich in IL-12 will lead to the activation and differentiation of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. 22 It has recently been proposed that COPD may be an entity of autoimmune etiology, because autoantibodies have been found against peptides present in the extracellular matrix of lung tissue. Among them, the most important is elastin (anti-elastin antibodies are then formed). These autoantigens would be responsible, in large part, for mediating and perpetuating the inflammatory response present in the disease. 2 In this context, B lymphocytes present in the peribronchial lymph nodes will be of special importance. Once sensitized by CD4+ T lymphocytes, they will be able to synthesize and secrete antibodies (which may be directed against host peptides). 5 Migration of neutrophils to the inflammation region may be mediated largely by cytokines related to CD17+ Th17 lymphocytes ( Figure 3 ), since it has been shown that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 serve as inducers for the secretion of CXCL8, CXCL5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF by airway epithelial cells, which have as their mission the differentiation, proliferation and recruitment of these cells. 23 Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes are characterized by the production of IL-17 and are believed to be involved in protection against microorganisms for which Th1 and Th2 are not prepared to fight, such as certain extracellular bacteria and fungi. Its differentiation from naive T lymphocytes occurs from three signals: first, the binding of the TCR to the antigen; second, the action of costimulators (for example, B7 binding to CD28 present on the lymphocyte membrane); third, the environment of cytokines that exist in the medium, for example, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23 and TGF-β. 24 In this way, naive T lymphocyte is polarized to Th17 lymphocyte from transcription factors characteristic of that cell line, such as RORγT, STAT-3 and STAT-5. 25, 26 Once polarization of the naive T lymphocyte occurs in Th17 lymphocyte, it synthesizes IL-21 to generate an autocrine stimulation and, thus, to activate the transcription factor RORγT for the synthesis of new cytokines, especially of the IL-17 family. 27 In addition, IL-23 in combination with TGF-β also induces the activation of RORγT and subsequent expression of IL-17A. However, they can only do so after IL-6 or IL-21 has facilitated the expression of their receptors. 28, 29 It has also been proposed that, in addition to participating in the recruitment of leukocytes (mainly neutrophils), IL-17A influences most cells in the lung parenchyma, such as macrophages and DCs, which express receptors for  Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations IL-17A and synthesize proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. 30 On the other hand, IL-22 has been linked to multiple pathologies of an inflammatory nature, for example, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to having an important role in the defense of the lungs against pathogens, especially extracellular bacteria, assisting production and release, for example, of defensins in the mucosa of the airways, in addition to maintaining the integrity of the epithelium. 31 A study by Pichavant et al 31 showed that, during Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in mice exposed to cigar smoke, cytokine levels related to Th17 lymphocytes are decreased, leading to exacerbations. 33 In addition, IL-23 is associated with maintenance of the response generated by this group of cooperating T lymphocytes. Table 1 shows some of the main functions and characteristics of cytokines related to the Th17 profile. Generally, genes have characteristics common to each other but differ from one another at different levels, ranging from the locus, number of introns and exons, number of base pairs and the position in which they are within the genome (forward/reverse strand). In this case, the genes related to the Th17 profile have similar characteristics, such as being on the same chromosome and similar size in terms of base pairs. Table 2 shows the main characteristics of these genes. In general, COPD patients tend to experience frequent exacerbations. Of these, the most frequent are those of infectious origin, with bacteria and viruses being the most prevalent etiological agents, with 50%-70% and 30%, respectively. 37 The clinical manifestations present during exacerbations are a consequence of the action of the virus/bacteria and of the immune response against the pathogen that assembles the host. 38 Bacteria Previously, the lungs were believed to be a sterile area, free of microorganisms. 39 However, recent studies have shown that this is not entirely true and that the lungs contain, depending on the disease or stage in which they are found, a variable content of microbiomas. 40 In the upper airways, there are also colonizing microorganisms; nose, for example, is colonized by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Corynebacteria. 41 The nasopharynx is colonized under normal conditions by non-hemolytic, α-hemolytic Streptococcus and some Neisseria species, in addition to S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 42 The presence of bacteria in patients who have had an exacerbation does not prove that these alone are sufficient to trigger the exacerbation of the symptomatology of patients with COPD, because they can also be isolated in individuals who do not have this pathology. 39 In healthy individuals, different species of bacteria are constantly inhaled. However, due of the responsiveness of their immune system that is not compromised, they are not capable of infecting the host. This response is generated mainly by the presence of antimicrobial molecules present in the respiratory mucosa such as defensins, pentraxin-3, lactoferrin, lysozyme and cathelicidin, as well as immunoglobulin A (IgA) and tissue resident cells. 39 An important factor associated with the predisposition of COPD patients to present exacerbations is the metaplasia of squamous epithelial cells that appears as a consequence of the damage generated to the airway epithelium by the chemical compounds of the cigarette. This event, together with the loss of ciliated epithelial cells, promotes the accumulation of  Induces expression of G-CSF; it maintains the integrity of the epithelium by limiting cellular apoptosis and favoring regeneration processes.

Ponce-Gallegos et al infectious agents, generating an imbalance in the pulmonary microbioma and, therefore, a greater probability of producing an infection triggering exacerbations. 41 In addition, the loss of the tight junctions between epithelial cells acting as an impermeable barrier is a factor that helps colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria. It has also been shown that patients with COPD who are vaccinated against some pneumococcal strains are less prone to exacerbations due to this infectious agent. Table 3 shows the main bacteria causing exacerbations in patients with COPD. In the past, it was believed that only bacteria were capable of generating exacerbations in patients with COPD. 48, 52 However, the occurrence of these in the winter and symptoms similar to cold led to the belief that viruses were also associated with the complications of this obstructive pathology of the airways. 53 On the other hand, viral infections of the respiratory tract have been shown to influence the lung microbiome in patients with COPD, which indicates that both microorganisms can coexist and predispose to exacerbations. 54 The most prevalent viruses during acute exacerbations of COPD are rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza, among others. 51, 55 There are many factors that influence virus infection in patients with COPD. Among them, ICAM-1 overexpression stands out, where, for example, rhinoviruses are anchored and more easily enter epithelial cells, favoring infection. 41 It has been described in several studies that the functionality of NK lymphocytes in patients with COPD is severely diminished, which leads to a greater propensity for virus infections (rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, etc.), causal agents of a high percentage of exacerbations in this type of patients. The low antiviral activity is due, in large part, to the inhibition of the secretion of cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12, in addition to the low production of enzymes such as perforins, so they cannot eliminate the cells already infected by virus, so that the infection continues its course without having a response that attenuates it. 56 It has been proposed that vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25D] ) plays a key role on lung immunity. During a viral infection, vitamin D induces IκBα (a potent inhibitor of NF-κB) expression in airway epithelial cells, favoring a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and no change in viral clearance. 57 This increase of 1,25D in airways will contribute to control tissue damage, while maintaining viral clearance. In COPD, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and correlates with severity of COPD. 58 An important mechanism through which 1,25D can predispose to present an exacerbation is by suppressing Th1 (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α) and Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F) cytokines and promoting regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) (IL-10, TGF-β) function. 59 Lower levels of 1,25D in COPD may be explained by different mechanisms, for example, the reduction of cutaneous vitamin D3 production caused by smoking and limited sunlight exposure. Other mechanisms of vitamin D deficiency could be reduced vitamin D activation in liver and kidneys, increased vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue and decreased intestinal absorption. 60 As with pneumococcus, it is recommended that COPD patients be immunized annually with the influenza vaccine, since it is also one of the main etiological agents of exacerbations. In addition, several studies suggest that epidemiologically speaking, influenza vaccine is more effective than pneumococcus. 42 In COPD exacerbations, there is an increase in the lungs and respiratory tracts cellularity. Therefore, an increase in the number of leukocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages  Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations in the airway, and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines are directly related to the severity of the exacerbations. 39 Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes synthesize IL-17A that promotes the activation of bronchial fibroblasts, epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells, inducing them to produce proinflammatory cytokines responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils and their local infiltration, thus aggravating the COPD symptomatology. 55 IL-17A promotes inflammation by coordinating granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization. This cytokine is particularly central to lung immunity because it has been demonstrated that innate host defenses to respiratory pathogens are compromised in mice lacking this proinflammatory cytokine or its receptor (IL-17RA), leading to reduced neutrophil activation, differentiation and recruitment and increased bacterial proliferation. 61 Le Rouzic et al 62 in their study showed that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) inhibits S. pneumoniaeinduced monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) maturation and secretion of cytokines involved in Th1 and Th17 T cell differentiation, among which are IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 (which is necessary to Th17 polarization). These events can contribute to colonization of pathogens capable of generating exacerbations. Qiu et al 63 found that IL-27 significantly augmented T-bet expression by naive CD4+ T cells in Th1 conditions. In contrast, the expression of ROR-γT was dramatically suppressed by the addition of IL-27. Both in COPD patients and in mice, cigarette smoke exposure induced the upregulation of IL-27R (WSX-1) by naive CD4+ T cells. IL-27 promotes the expression of Th1 cells but inhibits the expression of Th17 cells in vitro. Also, IL-27R expression is increased during bacterial and parasitic infections, bringing on an exacerbation. Receptors on the cell membrane of antigen-presenting phagocytes (APCs) such as TLRs recognize the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the membrane of bacteria such as H. influenzae and M. catharralis that colonize in a large part of the respiratory tract under normal conditions and that imbalance in the pulmonary microbiome exerts a stimulus that allows phagocytes to synthesize and release proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to phagocytosing the pathogen to subsequently present the antigen to T lymphocytes naive and allow their polarization together with the cytokine microenvironment present at that time. These data suggest that CD17+ Th17 lymphocytes play an important role in the immune response to bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and M. catharralis. 56 DCs are professional APCs whose principal function is linking the innate and adaptive immune responses, a central mechanism in COPD. A chronic exposure to CSE has been related to a deficiency in the phagolysosome trafficking in DC, secondary to low expression of maturation markers such as CD83, which leads to a deficient antigenic presentation and, consequently, an inadequate response against bacteria such as S. pneumoniae. 62 van der Sluijs et al 64 reported in their study that inhibiting the production of IL-10 (inhibitory cytokine) by Tregs decreases the likelihood of secondary S. pneumoniae infection. In the case of viruses, pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by TLRs present in endolysosomes or by RIG1 receptors (RLRs) in the cytoplasm. When this happens, the signaling pathway led by NF-κB and IRF3 culminates in the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to type I IFNs, such as IFN-α and IFN-β, creating an antiviral state that rests the infection. With the production of these IFNs, inhibition of the response of this strain of cooperating T lymphocytes, such as Th17 CD4+, is generated, causing greater susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, thus aggravating the health status of patients with COPD susceptible to this type of infections. 56 Since cytokines such as IL-17A and IL-17F do not exist in the airway microenvironment, the production of neutrophil chemoattractants by airway epithelial cells such as CXCL8 and CXCL5 cannot be induced and the action required attracting neutrophils, and therefore, there is not adequate containment of extracellular bacteria. 34 Another way that has been recently described as an important mediator of Th17 CD4+ inducers is a serum amyloid A (SAA), which promotes expression of inflammatory mediators and neutrophil chemotaxis and survival by the ALX-FPR2 receptor. SAA is also a potent endogenous ligand that stimulates expression of Th17 polarizing mediators and influences in vitro Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells. 61 Mechanisms involved in infectious COPD exacerbations are not entirely clear. Various cellular types and molecules are involved in its pathogenesis. Importantly, the Th17 profile has been linked as one of the main participants, which involves a complex system of proinflammatory cells and molecules. For these reasons, it is essential to conduct clinical and basic studies to have a broader perspective of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that take place during COPD exacerbations, which can compromise the life of patients. the initial Marco Antonio Ponce-Gallegos research for this article in the HLA laboratory.

International Journal of COPD 2017:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations of the mucus produced by goblet cells and less elimination of pathogens), metaplasia (change from one cell type to another, which in normal situations would not be present in a specific tissue) of squamous epithelial cells, hyperplasia of goblet-producing goblet cells and basal cells (a type of cells capable of differentiating into ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cells, caused by the action of growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor [EGF]), in addition to the loss of tight junctions that, under normal conditions, work as an impermeable barrier and protect the respiratory tract from pathogens, xenobiotics and other harmful particles. 9, 13 Once the damage is generated in airway epithelial cells, they secrete chemical mediators (chemokines, cytokines, etc.) in order to generate and maintain an inflammatory response against foreign agents. 5 Cell death produced releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as heat shock proteins, S100 protein and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), 14 which are recognized by extracellular receptors present in neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs; such as Toll-like receptors [TLRs], for example) [15] [16] [17] and trigger an intracellular signaling cascade led by the transcription factors Myd88 and NF-κB that culminate in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18 (a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase 1 and releasing mature forms of various cytokines), 18 which, together with other cytokines (TNF-α, CXCL8, IL-6, among others), are responsible for the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammation zone. Once in the area to which they were recruited, leukocytes (mainly neutrophils and macrophages) release products stored in their granules, such as enzymes responsible for destroying the extracellular matrix (MMP-9, MMP-12, NE), which help their migration through the lung parenchyma but, in turn, generate damage in the lung, thus promoting the progressive reduction of its functionality. 19  Mostly, adaptive immunity appears due to the action of DCs that, in the first instance, pick up the signals of damage of diverse cell types or the antigens that it recognizes as strangers and takes them to the lymph nodes and it is there where it happens the antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules either class I or class II, which results in the differentiation and polarization of T lymphocytes, which recognize the antigen presented by mediated T lymphocyte receptor (T cell receptor [TCR]) ( Figure 2 ). 20, 21 In addition, the production of proinflammatory cytokines is required for this polarization to occur. For example, a microenvironment rich in IL-12 will lead to the activation and differentiation of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. 22 It has recently been proposed that COPD may be an entity of autoimmune etiology, because autoantibodies have been found against peptides present in the extracellular matrix of lung tissue. Among them, the most important is elastin (anti-elastin antibodies are then formed). These autoantigens would be responsible, in large part, for mediating and perpetuating the inflammatory response present in the disease. 2 In this context, B lymphocytes present in the peribronchial lymph nodes will be of special importance. Once sensitized by CD4+ T lymphocytes, they will be able to synthesize and secrete antibodies (which may be directed against host peptides). 5 Migration of neutrophils to the inflammation region may be mediated largely by cytokines related to CD17+ Th17 lymphocytes ( Figure 3 ), since it has been shown that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 serve as inducers for the secretion of CXCL8, CXCL5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF by airway epithelial cells, which have as their mission the differentiation, proliferation and recruitment of these cells. 23 Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes are characterized by the production of IL-17 and are believed to be involved in protection against microorganisms for which Th1 and Th2 are not prepared to fight, such as certain extracellular bacteria and fungi. Its differentiation from naive T lymphocytes occurs from three signals: first, the binding of the TCR to the antigen; second, the action of costimulators (for example, B7 binding to CD28 present on the lymphocyte membrane); third, the environment of cytokines that exist in the medium, for example, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23 and TGF-β. 24 In this way, naive T lymphocyte is polarized to Th17 lymphocyte from transcription factors characteristic of that cell line, such as RORγT, STAT-3 and STAT-5. 25, 26 Once polarization of the naive T lymphocyte occurs in Th17 lymphocyte, it synthesizes IL-21 to generate an autocrine stimulation and, thus, to activate the transcription factor RORγT for the synthesis of new cytokines, especially of the IL-17 family. 27 In addition, IL-23 in combination with TGF-β also induces the activation of RORγT and subsequent expression of IL-17A. However, they can only do so after IL-6 or IL-21 has facilitated the expression of their receptors. 28, 29 It has also been proposed that, in addition to participating in the recruitment of leukocytes (mainly neutrophils), IL-17A influences most cells in the lung parenchyma, such as macrophages and DCs, which express receptors for  Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations IL-17A and synthesize proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. 30 On the other hand, IL-22 has been linked to multiple pathologies of an inflammatory nature, for example, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to having an important role in the defense of the lungs against pathogens, especially extracellular bacteria, assisting production and release, for example, of defensins in the mucosa of the airways, in addition to maintaining the integrity of the epithelium. 31 A study by Pichavant et al 31 showed that, during Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in mice exposed to cigar smoke, cytokine levels related to Th17 lymphocytes are decreased, leading to exacerbations. 33 In addition, IL-23 is associated with maintenance of the response generated by this group of cooperating T lymphocytes. Table 1 shows some of the main functions and characteristics of cytokines related to the Th17 profile. Generally, genes have characteristics common to each other but differ from one another at different levels, ranging from the locus, number of introns and exons, number of base pairs and the position in which they are within the genome (forward/reverse strand). In this case, the genes related to the Th17 profile have similar characteristics, such as being on the same chromosome and similar size in terms of base pairs. Table 2 shows the main characteristics of these genes. In general, COPD patients tend to experience frequent exacerbations. Of these, the most frequent are those of infectious origin, with bacteria and viruses being the most prevalent etiological agents, with 50%-70% and 30%, respectively. 37 The clinical manifestations present during exacerbations are a consequence of the action of the virus/bacteria and of the immune response against the pathogen that assembles the host. 38 Bacteria Previously, the lungs were believed to be a sterile area, free of microorganisms. 39 However, recent studies have shown that this is not entirely true and that the lungs contain, depending on the disease or stage in which they are found, a variable content of microbiomas. 40 In the upper airways, there are also colonizing microorganisms; nose, for example, is colonized by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Corynebacteria. 41 The nasopharynx is colonized under normal conditions by non-hemolytic, α-hemolytic Streptococcus and some Neisseria species, in addition to S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 42 The presence of bacteria in patients who have had an exacerbation does not prove that these alone are sufficient to trigger the exacerbation of the symptomatology of patients with COPD, because they can also be isolated in individuals who do not have this pathology. 39 In healthy individuals, different species of bacteria are constantly inhaled. However, due of the responsiveness of their immune system that is not compromised, they are not capable of infecting the host. This response is generated mainly by the presence of antimicrobial molecules present in the respiratory mucosa such as defensins, pentraxin-3, lactoferrin, lysozyme and cathelicidin, as well as immunoglobulin A (IgA) and tissue resident cells. 39 An important factor associated with the predisposition of COPD patients to present exacerbations is the metaplasia of squamous epithelial cells that appears as a consequence of the damage generated to the airway epithelium by the chemical compounds of the cigarette. This event, together with the loss of ciliated epithelial cells, promotes the accumulation of  Induces expression of G-CSF; it maintains the integrity of the epithelium by limiting cellular apoptosis and favoring regeneration processes.

Ponce-Gallegos et al infectious agents, generating an imbalance in the pulmonary microbioma and, therefore, a greater probability of producing an infection triggering exacerbations. 41 In addition, the loss of the tight junctions between epithelial cells acting as an impermeable barrier is a factor that helps colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria. It has also been shown that patients with COPD who are vaccinated against some pneumococcal strains are less prone to exacerbations due to this infectious agent. Table 3 shows the main bacteria causing exacerbations in patients with COPD. In the past, it was believed that only bacteria were capable of generating exacerbations in patients with COPD. 48, 52 However, the occurrence of these in the winter and symptoms similar to cold led to the belief that viruses were also associated with the complications of this obstructive pathology of the airways. 53 On the other hand, viral infections of the respiratory tract have been shown to influence the lung microbiome in patients with COPD, which indicates that both microorganisms can coexist and predispose to exacerbations. 54 The most prevalent viruses during acute exacerbations of COPD are rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza, among others. 51, 55 There are many factors that influence virus infection in patients with COPD. Among them, ICAM-1 overexpression stands out, where, for example, rhinoviruses are anchored and more easily enter epithelial cells, favoring infection. 41 It has been described in several studies that the functionality of NK lymphocytes in patients with COPD is severely diminished, which leads to a greater propensity for virus infections (rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, etc.), causal agents of a high percentage of exacerbations in this type of patients. The low antiviral activity is due, in large part, to the inhibition of the secretion of cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12, in addition to the low production of enzymes such as perforins, so they cannot eliminate the cells already infected by virus, so that the infection continues its course without having a response that attenuates it. 56 It has been proposed that vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25D] ) plays a key role on lung immunity. During a viral infection, vitamin D induces IκBα (a potent inhibitor of NF-κB) expression in airway epithelial cells, favoring a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and no change in viral clearance. 57 This increase of 1,25D in airways will contribute to control tissue damage, while maintaining viral clearance. In COPD, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and correlates with severity of COPD. 58 An important mechanism through which 1,25D can predispose to present an exacerbation is by suppressing Th1 (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α) and Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F) cytokines and promoting regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) (IL-10, TGF-β) function. 59 Lower levels of 1,25D in COPD may be explained by different mechanisms, for example, the reduction of cutaneous vitamin D3 production caused by smoking and limited sunlight exposure. Other mechanisms of vitamin D deficiency could be reduced vitamin D activation in liver and kidneys, increased vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue and decreased intestinal absorption. 60 As with pneumococcus, it is recommended that COPD patients be immunized annually with the influenza vaccine, since it is also one of the main etiological agents of exacerbations. In addition, several studies suggest that epidemiologically speaking, influenza vaccine is more effective than pneumococcus. 42 In COPD exacerbations, there is an increase in the lungs and respiratory tracts cellularity. Therefore, an increase in the number of leukocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages  Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations in the airway, and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines are directly related to the severity of the exacerbations. 39 Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes synthesize IL-17A that promotes the activation of bronchial fibroblasts, epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells, inducing them to produce proinflammatory cytokines responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils and their local infiltration, thus aggravating the COPD symptomatology. 55 IL-17A promotes inflammation by coordinating granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization. This cytokine is particularly central to lung immunity because it has been demonstrated that innate host defenses to respiratory pathogens are compromised in mice lacking this proinflammatory cytokine or its receptor (IL-17RA), leading to reduced neutrophil activation, differentiation and recruitment and increased bacterial proliferation. 61 Le Rouzic et al 62 in their study showed that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) inhibits S. pneumoniaeinduced monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) maturation and secretion of cytokines involved in Th1 and Th17 T cell differentiation, among which are IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 (which is necessary to Th17 polarization). These events can contribute to colonization of pathogens capable of generating exacerbations. Qiu et al 63 found that IL-27 significantly augmented T-bet expression by naive CD4+ T cells in Th1 conditions. In contrast, the expression of ROR-γT was dramatically suppressed by the addition of IL-27. Both in COPD patients and in mice, cigarette smoke exposure induced the upregulation of IL-27R (WSX-1) by naive CD4+ T cells. IL-27 promotes the expression of Th1 cells but inhibits the expression of Th17 cells in vitro. Also, IL-27R expression is increased during bacterial and parasitic infections, bringing on an exacerbation. Receptors on the cell membrane of antigen-presenting phagocytes (APCs) such as TLRs recognize the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the membrane of bacteria such as H. influenzae and M. catharralis that colonize in a large part of the respiratory tract under normal conditions and that imbalance in the pulmonary microbiome exerts a stimulus that allows phagocytes to synthesize and release proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to phagocytosing the pathogen to subsequently present the antigen to T lymphocytes naive and allow their polarization together with the cytokine microenvironment present at that time. These data suggest that CD17+ Th17 lymphocytes play an important role in the immune response to bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and M. catharralis. 56 DCs are professional APCs whose principal function is linking the innate and adaptive immune responses, a central mechanism in COPD. A chronic exposure to CSE has been related to a deficiency in the phagolysosome trafficking in DC, secondary to low expression of maturation markers such as CD83, which leads to a deficient antigenic presentation and, consequently, an inadequate response against bacteria such as S. pneumoniae. 62 van der Sluijs et al 64 reported in their study that inhibiting the production of IL-10 (inhibitory cytokine) by Tregs decreases the likelihood of secondary S. pneumoniae infection. In the case of viruses, pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by TLRs present in endolysosomes or by RIG1 receptors (RLRs) in the cytoplasm. When this happens, the signaling pathway led by NF-κB and IRF3 culminates in the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to type I IFNs, such as IFN-α and IFN-β, creating an antiviral state that rests the infection. With the production of these IFNs, inhibition of the response of this strain of cooperating T lymphocytes, such as Th17 CD4+, is generated, causing greater susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, thus aggravating the health status of patients with COPD susceptible to this type of infections. 56 Since cytokines such as IL-17A and IL-17F do not exist in the airway microenvironment, the production of neutrophil chemoattractants by airway epithelial cells such as CXCL8 and CXCL5 cannot be induced and the action required attracting neutrophils, and therefore, there is not adequate containment of extracellular bacteria. 34 Another way that has been recently described as an important mediator of Th17 CD4+ inducers is a serum amyloid A (SAA), which promotes expression of inflammatory mediators and neutrophil chemotaxis and survival by the ALX-FPR2 receptor. SAA is also a potent endogenous ligand that stimulates expression of Th17 polarizing mediators and influences in vitro Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells. 61 Mechanisms involved in infectious COPD exacerbations are not entirely clear. Various cellular types and molecules are involved in its pathogenesis. Importantly, the Th17 profile has been linked as one of the main participants, which involves a complex system of proinflammatory cells and molecules. For these reasons, it is essential to conduct clinical and basic studies to have a broader perspective of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that take place during COPD exacerbations, which can compromise the life of patients. the initial Marco Antonio Ponce-Gallegos research for this article in the HLA laboratory.

         "Estimates of global research productivity in using nicotine replacement therapy for tobacco cessation: a bibliometric study",
         "BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Tobacco smoking remains the most important risk factor for both cancer and heart diseases. This study was initiated due to the lack of published data concerning the real progress in research output in the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for tobacco cessation. This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. METHODS: Core of the search strategy was the documents that contained specific words or phrases regarding NRT as keywords in the title. Publication output of most prolific countries was adjusted to the gross domestic product and population size. All citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 2138 references were retrieved and published from 56 countries, which were published between 1970 and 2016. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications). No data related to NRT were published from 156 countries. No significant correlation was found between the country population size or 2016 gross domestic product values and the number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = − 0.156, P = 0.664; and r = − 0.173, P = 0.632, respectively). Furthermore, there is no correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = − 0.235, P = 0.514). CONCLUSIONS: The present data reveal a solid mass of research activity on NRT. The USA was by far the predominant country in the amount of NRT-based research activity. NRT-based research activities were low or not available in most countries. The results of this study delineate a framework for better understanding the situations of current NRT research and prospective directions of the research in this field which could be applied for managing and prioritizing future research efforts in NRT research.",

         "Tobacco use is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Tobacco smoking remains the most important risk factor for both cancer and heart diseases causing about 6 million deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars burdens at global level each year [1, 2] . The World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) recommends that governments institute broad national tobacco control policies, which should contain the provision of treatment for tobacco dependence, including use of effective smoking-cessation strategies and counselling services [3] . Medication therapy such as nicotine has been shown to help in smoking cessation [4] . This type of medication is called Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) [4] . NRT has been widely accepted as the first-line pharmacological intervention for tobacco dependence because of its safety and efficacy profile [5] [6] [7] . Since the development of NRT in 1978, tobacco cessation options have continued to evolve and expand [8] . The aim of NRT is to reduce or prevent withdrawal symptoms related to quitting smoking by substituting the nicotine from tobacco smoking to reach complete abstinence from tobacco smoking [9] [10] [11] [12] . NRT is available in various forms, e.g. nicotine skin patches, chewing nicotine gum, lozenges/tablets, nasal and oral sprays and inhalers [6, 7] . All forms of NRT were all significantly more effective than placebo, or no NRT, as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation [6] . Tobacco smoking is on the rise, and since smoking behaviours and consequences involve a multidisciplinary research approach, there is an increasing level of research that includes almost all of worldwide regions that have interested in health sciences production [13, 14] . Research output has an important function in the scientific development providing a key association between knowledge generation, and use [15] . Although, to the author's knowledge, there were small number of bibliometric studies in the field of tobacco smoking were conducted [2, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , no bibliometric studies have been conducted in the field of NRT. Bibliometric is the application of quantitative analysis method based on statistics and mathematics within a given certain topic [21] [22] [23] . This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level, and to identify hotspots in research related to NRT. Results from this study will allow researchers to identify the hotspots in NRT which may open doors to new research on the development of effective smoking-cessation strategies and counselling services. Additionally, results delineate a framework for a perceptive recognition of current NRT research and as a result of a realistic advice for decision makers. The analysis of the scientific research output in this bibliometric study was based on previous bibliometric studies [2, 14, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Scopus database was used as the source to retrieve all the bibliometric data regarding the research output in the field of NRT. The Scopus database was used because it is the largest citation and abstract database of peer-reviewed Journals, and it is one of the most reliable databases for publications and citations. Moreover, this database has been widely used in several bibliometric studies in the field of tobacco use [2, 14, 19, 28] . Furthermore, Scopus database has been commonly employed in several bibliometric analyses due to combining in the characteristics of both Web of Science and PubMed [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Documents were selected including the keywords related to NRT that were chosen from previous studies may have been reviews, practical reporting or metaanalyses [6, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Keywords used are: 'nicotine replacement' , 'NRT' , 'nicotine patches' , 'nicotine gum' , 'nicotine transdermal' , 'nicotine medications' , 'Nicotinell' , 'Nicoderm' , 'nicotine chewing' , 'nicotine pastilles' , 'nicotine delivery system' , 'Nicorette' , 'medicinal nicotine' , 'nicotine tablet' , 'over-the-counter nicotine' , 'OTC nicotine' , 'nicotine orally' , 'nicotine intranasal' , 'nicotine polacrilex' , 'nicotine sprays' , 'nicotine sublingual' , 'nicotine lozenges' and 'nicotine inhalers'. These keywords were used to search titles. Although people reported that using electronic cigarette (EC) may reduce cigarette smoking consumption and help quit smoking [42, 43] , EC was not included as an avenue of nicotine replacement. Little evidence is known about EC, and relatively little research on this issue has been performed [44] [45] [46] . In a recent systematic review about EC that health care providers are recommended to be aware that EC devises are of unknown safety and of unsure help as an effective smoking-cessation strategy [47] . Most of the time, NRT term is used as a general term in many different types of sciences. So, to avoid this confusion, the following keywords: 'smoking' and 'tobacco' were entered as 'article title, abstract, keywords'. The bibliometric analysis is determined by looking at all past years up to December 31, 2016 and all citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017 to avoid any updating on the database [14] . Research output in the years 2017 was expelled from further analysis. Furthermore, erratum documents were excluded from analysis. The NRT research productivity was analyzed as previous similar bibliometric studies [2, 14, [24] [25] [26] [27] by examining the relative growth rate, citations patterns, collaborative measures, the most prolific institutions and journals. The indicators of bibliometric evaluation including countries, journals, cited articles, and institutions were transformed to the rank order by using the standard competition ranking (SCR) (i.e. \"1224\" ranking) as in previous similar bibliometric studies [33, 34, [48] [49] [50] . Only the ten top-ranked of the measurements were taken into account. In addition, the impact factor (IF) for the ten top-ranked journals was derived from 2016 Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Furthermore, the h-index (also known as Hirsch index) was used as qualitative measure to assess the scientific research performance in the field of NRT for the ten top-ranked countries. The h-index was introduced by J. Hirsch in 2005 [51] and is defined as follows: \"A certain country has an h-index, if it has at least h publications for which it has received at least h citations\". All extracted data from Scopus were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 15.0). Frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range (IQR: i.e. Q1-Q3, lower quartile-upper quartile) were considered. Research activity for the top 10 countries were adjusted to the population size (publications per 1 million inhabitants) and the gross domestic product (GDP) value (publications per $1 billion USD of GDP) retrieved from the online databases of the World Bank [52] , and data associated with prevalence of tobacco smoking retrieved from the online databases of the World Health Organization [53] . Pearson's correlation coefficient test was used to assess the correlations between number of publications and the countries' population and economies indicators or prevalence of tobacco smoking. P < 0.05 was considered significant. In addition, VOSviewer software version 1.6.6 [54] was used to build bibliometric diagrams for visualization the co-occurrence network of terms extracted from the title or abstract of the articles, and to visualize the collaboration network between countries. Using the methodology presented above, 2138 documents related to the use of NRT in tobacco cessation were retrieved. Among them, 1533 (71.7%) were original journal articles, distantly followed by note (171, 8.0%), letters to the editor (160, 7.5%), review articles (149, 7.0%), and other document types such as editorials (125, 4.8%). The yearly production trend increased steadily from 1970 to 2016, and showed a clearer trend to increase in the last years ( Fig. 1 ). The first article related to NRT for tobacco cessation in Scopus was published by Jarvik et al. in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics in 1970 [55] . Most documents published in the field of NRT were in English (n = 1961; 91.7%), followed by German (n = 55; 2.6%), French (n = 31; 1.4%) and Spanish language documents (n = 30; 1.4%). The 2138 documents on NRT research were published by research groups in 56 countries/territories. Figure 2 shows the collaboration network of countries who had at least five publications. The thickness of lines indicates the size of collaboration and the size of circles signifies the number of publications of the country. In addition, the USA produces the most international collaborative documents, with involvement from 32 countries, followed by 21 countries for the UK and 19 for Sweden. The top 10 countries published 1809 documents, accounting for 84.6% of the total number of publications. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications); (Table 1) . No data related to NRT were published from 156 (73.6%). The publication tendency of the most active 4 countries among the first 10 countries in the field of NRT was revealed in Fig. 3 . After adjusting for population size, Sweden, New Zealand and Denmark become the most prolific country by achieving the highest number of publications per population size in million inhabitants (10.303, 7.249, and 7.155, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting for the socio-economic parameters, New Zealand, Denmark, and the UK become the most prolific country by achieving the highest number of publications per GDP (current US$) in billion (0.184, 0.134, and 0.118, respectively); (Table 1) The total number of citations for the published articles related to the use of NRT in tobacco cessation was 57,333, with a median of citations (interquartile range) nine (9-31) which achieved 26.8 citations per document. Moreover, the h-index for the published articles related to the use of NRT in tobacco cessation was 113 (113 articles had been achieved citations at least 113 times), and the highest h of an individual was 92 for the USA, followed by 57 for the UK. The top 10 most productive journals are summarized in Table 2 . Nicotine and Tobacco Research ranked first and published 143 (6.69%) articles on NRT. Addiction published the second most articles (77, 3.60%), followed by Psychopharmacology (61, 2.85%), and Addictive Behaviors (54, 2.53%). Furthermore, all the top 10 most productive journals had an official IF more than 2. It was shown that the USA was the most prolific country for the top 10 most productive journals ( Table 2) . Medicine was the most researched area, achieved by 1760 (82.3%) articles, followed by pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics with 485 (22.7%) articles, and psychology with 167 (7.8%) articles. The co-occurrence network of terms that extracted from the title or abstract of at least in 10 articles are presented in Fig. 4a . Overall, 445 of the 23,444 terms meet the threshold of co-occurrence and the top 60% with the highest relevance, that is, 267 terms are set out in the figure and were classified into the 4 clusters according to different colors. The blue cluster mainly represents randomized clinical trials in which NRT in different dosage forms was compared to placebo. The yellow one include terms mainly grouping topics related to related to randomized clinical trials in which NRT in different dosage forms was compared vs. varenicline vs. bupropion vs. Combination. while the red cluster normally implement terms related to population survey studies regarding attitudes, practices, perceptions, and barriers in tobacco cessation. Moreover, the green cluster includes side effect of NRT and pharmacokinetic terms as well. Terms were color coded by VOSviewer based on the average time they founded in the 2138 related publications (Fig. 4b) . Figure 3b represented the earlier (blue color) or later (red color) years when the term appeared. Before 2010, in the early stage of NRT research, the main popular topics were related to clinical trials of NRT. The latest trends showed that the main popular topics were related to population survey studies regarding NRT. Table 3 shows the articles with high citations from 1970 to 2016. Number of citations ranged from 1348 to Table 4 illustrates the top 10 prolific institutions ranked by the numbers of publications. The most productive institution was the VA Medical Center, USA (3.18%), followed by King's College London, UK (3.13%), and University of Pittsburgh, USA (3.04%). For authors who had the most publications in the field of NRT (Table 5) , Shiffman, S ranked the first (59 publications), followed by Benowitz, NL (54 publications), and West, R (53 publications). The cooperation between authors was elucidated in a network map (Fig. 5 ). Reducing morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use involves an understanding of how scientific research related to tobacco use has progressed. Such study is helpful in implementation or developing of an efficient strategies to respond to this progress [25, 64] . To my knowledge, this is a first study that using bibliometric approach analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. Bibliometric indicators in the current study illustrated that research output in the field of NRT was ignored in most countries. The current study also adds to the emerging international bibliometric studies in the field of tobacco smoking [2, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , which may open doors to new research on the evaluation of effective smokingcessation strategies and counselling services. However, the first publications related to NRT were introduced in the early 1970s, the Lancet was published in 1942 paper entitled 'Tobacco smoking and nicotine' by Johnston who recognised smoking as one of the most important factors for lung cancer and later he considered one of the first anti-smoking campaigners by suggesting a total ban on smoking [65] . Johnston reported that he had administered a subcutaneous small dose of nicotine solution to 35 volunteers, including himself [65] . He declared that if nicotine injections were abruptly discontinued, craving to tobacco will be arise. He demonstrated that smoking tobacco (i.e. smoking addiction) is actually a means of administer nicotine, similar to smoking opium is essentially a means to administer morphine [65, 66] . Jarvik and colleagues published the first article about the use of orally administered nicotine for tobacco substitutes in 1970 in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics. Jarvik et al. found that nicotine administration produces a significant decrease in the average number of cigarettes smoked [55] . Later, Jarvik became the co-inventor of the nicotine patch. Three years later, Ferno and colleagues developed a chewing nicotine gum that released nicotine at a suitable rate when chewed [67] . A preliminary report given at the Second World Conference on Smoking and Health in 1971 in London compared the nicotine-containing chewing gum with a placebo gum in a double blind study [68] , and the results were published in 1973 in Psychopharmacologia [69] . The USA was the most prolific country, accounting for 46.1% (n = 986) of total output. Furthermore, the USA was the most collaborative country in the world and got the central position in the collaborative network. This finding was similar to other recent studies related to waterpipe tobacco smoking and EC [14, 28] . The current research indicates that Australia has published a b Fig. 4 Mapping of terms in the research on nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). a shows the co-occurrence network of terms that extracted from the title or abstract of at least 10 articles.

The 10 most prolific countries to publish articles on NRT consist of numerous nations that will be similar to other scientific output rankings [70] . This research output from these countries is possible due to fact that these are: a) countries with more resources [71] , b) countries experiencing high rates of tobacco smoking [53] , c) countries with a research and publishing culture in relation to tobacco smoking [72] [73] [74] [75] , and d) countries that publish most journals in the field of health [76] . In the current study, the performance in research output for every country is different. This study demonstrated that the USA and the UK are the most influential countries in the field of NRT. This activity may be associated with the population size, and socioeconomic of these countries [77] . No study has been found in the literature similar to this point, thus the author was interpreting these results in light of other results. These findings are consistent with data obtained in other previous research which found similar findings [78, 79] . Countries with fast-rising economies, which consequently have more funding and investment for conducting research [25] , thus may contribute to increasing number of publications regarding NRT. In this study, the average citation rate was 26.8 citations per article. This citation was higher than the average citation of papers published in toxicological journals [24, 26, [80] [81] [82] . A more recent studies using similar bibliometric indicators found the average citation rate for waterpipe tobacco smoking publications was 13 citations per article, and for EC publications was 6.4 citations per article [14, 28] . This finding indicates that NRT become a hot issue in scientific research. Another important finding was that was the investigation of publications' quality. To note, all the top 10 journals in which international articles related to NRT were published carried IFs greater than 2.00 and had significant impact in the field of tobacco smoking.

         "Estimates of global research productivity in using nicotine replacement therapy for tobacco cessation: a bibliometric study. BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Tobacco smoking remains the most important risk factor for both cancer and heart diseases. This study was initiated due to the lack of published data concerning the real progress in research output in the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for tobacco cessation. This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. METHODS: Core of the search strategy was the documents that contained specific words or phrases regarding NRT as keywords in the title. Publication output of most prolific countries was adjusted to the gross domestic product and population size. All citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 2138 references were retrieved and published from 56 countries, which were published between 1970 and 2016. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications). No data related to NRT were published from 156 countries. No significant correlation was found between the country population size or 2016 gross domestic product values and the number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = − 0.156, P = 0.664; and r = − 0.173, P = 0.632, respectively). Furthermore, there is no correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = − 0.235, P = 0.514). CONCLUSIONS: The present data reveal a solid mass of research activity on NRT. The USA was by far the predominant country in the amount of NRT-based research activity. NRT-based research activities were low or not available in most countries. The results of this study delineate a framework for better understanding the situations of current NRT research and prospective directions of the research in this field which could be applied for managing and prioritizing future research efforts in NRT research.. Tobacco use is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Tobacco smoking remains the most important risk factor for both cancer and heart diseases causing about 6 million deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars burdens at global level each year [1, 2] . The World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) recommends that governments institute broad national tobacco control policies, which should contain the provision of treatment for tobacco dependence, including use of effective smoking-cessation strategies and counselling services [3] . Medication therapy such as nicotine has been shown to help in smoking cessation [4] . This type of medication is called Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) [4] . NRT has been widely accepted as the first-line pharmacological intervention for tobacco dependence because of its safety and efficacy profile [5] [6] [7] . Since the development of NRT in 1978, tobacco cessation options have continued to evolve and expand [8] . The aim of NRT is to reduce or prevent withdrawal symptoms related to quitting smoking by substituting the nicotine from tobacco smoking to reach complete abstinence from tobacco smoking [9] [10] [11] [12] . NRT is available in various forms, e.g. nicotine skin patches, chewing nicotine gum, lozenges/tablets, nasal and oral sprays and inhalers [6, 7] . All forms of NRT were all significantly more effective than placebo, or no NRT, as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation [6] . Tobacco smoking is on the rise, and since smoking behaviours and consequences involve a multidisciplinary research approach, there is an increasing level of research that includes almost all of worldwide regions that have interested in health sciences production [13, 14] . Research output has an important function in the scientific development providing a key association between knowledge generation, and use [15] . Although, to the author's knowledge, there were small number of bibliometric studies in the field of tobacco smoking were conducted [2, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , no bibliometric studies have been conducted in the field of NRT. Bibliometric is the application of quantitative analysis method based on statistics and mathematics within a given certain topic [21] [22] [23] . This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level, and to identify hotspots in research related to NRT. Results from this study will allow researchers to identify the hotspots in NRT which may open doors to new research on the development of effective smoking-cessation strategies and counselling services. Additionally, results delineate a framework for a perceptive recognition of current NRT research and as a result of a realistic advice for decision makers. The analysis of the scientific research output in this bibliometric study was based on previous bibliometric studies [2, 14, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Scopus database was used as the source to retrieve all the bibliometric data regarding the research output in the field of NRT. The Scopus database was used because it is the largest citation and abstract database of peer-reviewed Journals, and it is one of the most reliable databases for publications and citations. Moreover, this database has been widely used in several bibliometric studies in the field of tobacco use [2, 14, 19, 28] . Furthermore, Scopus database has been commonly employed in several bibliometric analyses due to combining in the characteristics of both Web of Science and PubMed [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Documents were selected including the keywords related to NRT that were chosen from previous studies may have been reviews, practical reporting or metaanalyses [6, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Keywords used are: 'nicotine replacement' , 'NRT' , 'nicotine patches' , 'nicotine gum' , 'nicotine transdermal' , 'nicotine medications' , 'Nicotinell' , 'Nicoderm' , 'nicotine chewing' , 'nicotine pastilles' , 'nicotine delivery system' , 'Nicorette' , 'medicinal nicotine' , 'nicotine tablet' , 'over-the-counter nicotine' , 'OTC nicotine' , 'nicotine orally' , 'nicotine intranasal' , 'nicotine polacrilex' , 'nicotine sprays' , 'nicotine sublingual' , 'nicotine lozenges' and 'nicotine inhalers'. These keywords were used to search titles. Although people reported that using electronic cigarette (EC) may reduce cigarette smoking consumption and help quit smoking [42, 43] , EC was not included as an avenue of nicotine replacement. Little evidence is known about EC, and relatively little research on this issue has been performed [44] [45] [46] . In a recent systematic review about EC that health care providers are recommended to be aware that EC devises are of unknown safety and of unsure help as an effective smoking-cessation strategy [47] . Most of the time, NRT term is used as a general term in many different types of sciences. So, to avoid this confusion, the following keywords: 'smoking' and 'tobacco' were entered as 'article title, abstract, keywords'. The bibliometric analysis is determined by looking at all past years up to December 31, 2016 and all citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017 to avoid any updating on the database [14] . Research output in the years 2017 was expelled from further analysis. Furthermore, erratum documents were excluded from analysis. The NRT research productivity was analyzed as previous similar bibliometric studies [2, 14, [24] [25] [26] [27] by examining the relative growth rate, citations patterns, collaborative measures, the most prolific institutions and journals. The indicators of bibliometric evaluation including countries, journals, cited articles, and institutions were transformed to the rank order by using the standard competition ranking (SCR) (i.e. \"1224\" ranking) as in previous similar bibliometric studies [33, 34, [48] [49] [50] . Only the ten top-ranked of the measurements were taken into account. In addition, the impact factor (IF) for the ten top-ranked journals was derived from 2016 Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Furthermore, the h-index (also known as Hirsch index) was used as qualitative measure to assess the scientific research performance in the field of NRT for the ten top-ranked countries. The h-index was introduced by J. Hirsch in 2005 [51] and is defined as follows: \"A certain country has an h-index, if it has at least h publications for which it has received at least h citations\". All extracted data from Scopus were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 15.0). Frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range (IQR: i.e. Q1-Q3, lower quartile-upper quartile) were considered. Research activity for the top 10 countries were adjusted to the population size (publications per 1 million inhabitants) and the gross domestic product (GDP) value (publications per $1 billion USD of GDP) retrieved from the online databases of the World Bank [52] , and data associated with prevalence of tobacco smoking retrieved from the online databases of the World Health Organization [53] . Pearson's correlation coefficient test was used to assess the correlations between number of publications and the countries' population and economies indicators or prevalence of tobacco smoking. P < 0.05 was considered significant. In addition, VOSviewer software version 1.6.6 [54] was used to build bibliometric diagrams for visualization the co-occurrence network of terms extracted from the title or abstract of the articles, and to visualize the collaboration network between countries. Using the methodology presented above, 2138 documents related to the use of NRT in tobacco cessation were retrieved. Among them, 1533 (71.7%) were original journal articles, distantly followed by note (171, 8.0%), letters to the editor (160, 7.5%), review articles (149, 7.0%), and other document types such as editorials (125, 4.8%). The yearly production trend increased steadily from 1970 to 2016, and showed a clearer trend to increase in the last years ( Fig. 1 ). The first article related to NRT for tobacco cessation in Scopus was published by Jarvik et al. in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics in 1970 [55] . Most documents published in the field of NRT were in English (n = 1961; 91.7%), followed by German (n = 55; 2.6%), French (n = 31; 1.4%) and Spanish language documents (n = 30; 1.4%). The 2138 documents on NRT research were published by research groups in 56 countries/territories. Figure 2 shows the collaboration network of countries who had at least five publications. The thickness of lines indicates the size of collaboration and the size of circles signifies the number of publications of the country. In addition, the USA produces the most international collaborative documents, with involvement from 32 countries, followed by 21 countries for the UK and 19 for Sweden. The top 10 countries published 1809 documents, accounting for 84.6% of the total number of publications. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications); (Table 1) . No data related to NRT were published from 156 (73.6%). The publication tendency of the most active 4 countries among the first 10 countries in the field of NRT was revealed in Fig. 3 . After adjusting for population size, Sweden, New Zealand and Denmark become the most prolific country by achieving the highest number of publications per population size in million inhabitants (10.303, 7.249, and 7.155, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting for the socio-economic parameters, New Zealand, Denmark, and the UK become the most prolific country by achieving the highest number of publications per GDP (current US$) in billion (0.184, 0.134, and 0.118, respectively); (Table 1) The total number of citations for the published articles related to the use of NRT in tobacco cessation was 57,333, with a median of citations (interquartile range) nine (9-31) which achieved 26.8 citations per document. Moreover, the h-index for the published articles related to the use of NRT in tobacco cessation was 113 (113 articles had been achieved citations at least 113 times), and the highest h of an individual was 92 for the USA, followed by 57 for the UK. The top 10 most productive journals are summarized in Table 2 . Nicotine and Tobacco Research ranked first and published 143 (6.69%) articles on NRT. Addiction published the second most articles (77, 3.60%), followed by Psychopharmacology (61, 2.85%), and Addictive Behaviors (54, 2.53%). Furthermore, all the top 10 most productive journals had an official IF more than 2. It was shown that the USA was the most prolific country for the top 10 most productive journals ( Table 2) . Medicine was the most researched area, achieved by 1760 (82.3%) articles, followed by pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics with 485 (22.7%) articles, and psychology with 167 (7.8%) articles. The co-occurrence network of terms that extracted from the title or abstract of at least in 10 articles are presented in Fig. 4a . Overall, 445 of the 23,444 terms meet the threshold of co-occurrence and the top 60% with the highest relevance, that is, 267 terms are set out in the figure and were classified into the 4 clusters according to different colors. The blue cluster mainly represents randomized clinical trials in which NRT in different dosage forms was compared to placebo. The yellow one include terms mainly grouping topics related to related to randomized clinical trials in which NRT in different dosage forms was compared vs. varenicline vs. bupropion vs. Combination. while the red cluster normally implement terms related to population survey studies regarding attitudes, practices, perceptions, and barriers in tobacco cessation. Moreover, the green cluster includes side effect of NRT and pharmacokinetic terms as well. Terms were color coded by VOSviewer based on the average time they founded in the 2138 related publications (Fig. 4b) . Figure 3b represented the earlier (blue color) or later (red color) years when the term appeared. Before 2010, in the early stage of NRT research, the main popular topics were related to clinical trials of NRT. The latest trends showed that the main popular topics were related to population survey studies regarding NRT. Table 3 shows the articles with high citations from 1970 to 2016. Number of citations ranged from 1348 to Table 4 illustrates the top 10 prolific institutions ranked by the numbers of publications. The most productive institution was the VA Medical Center, USA (3.18%), followed by King's College London, UK (3.13%), and University of Pittsburgh, USA (3.04%). For authors who had the most publications in the field of NRT (Table 5) , Shiffman, S ranked the first (59 publications), followed by Benowitz, NL (54 publications), and West, R (53 publications). The cooperation between authors was elucidated in a network map (Fig. 5 ). Reducing morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use involves an understanding of how scientific research related to tobacco use has progressed. Such study is helpful in implementation or developing of an efficient strategies to respond to this progress [25, 64] . To my knowledge, this is a first study that using bibliometric approach analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. Bibliometric indicators in the current study illustrated that research output in the field of NRT was ignored in most countries. The current study also adds to the emerging international bibliometric studies in the field of tobacco smoking [2, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , which may open doors to new research on the evaluation of effective smokingcessation strategies and counselling services.

         "BACKGROUND: Severe infections are common complications of immunosuppressive treatment for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) with renal involvement. We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors of severe infection in Chinese patients with AAV after immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: A total of 248 patients with a new diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis were included in this study. The incidence, time, site, and risk factors of severe infection by the induction therapies were analysed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 103 episodes of severe infection were identified in 86 (34.7%, 86/248) patients during a median follow-up of 15 months. The incidence of infection during induction therapy was 38.5% for corticosteroids (CS), 39.0% for CS+ intravenous cyclophosphamide (IV-CYC), 33.8% for CS+ mycophenolate mofetil and 22.5% for CS + tripterygium glycosides, 76 (73.8%) infection episodes occurred within 6 months, while 66 (64.1%) occurred within 3 months. Pneumonia (71.8%, 74/103) was the most frequent type of infection, and the main pathogenic spectrum included bacteria (78.6%), fungi (12.6%), and viruses (8.7%). The risk factors associated with infection were age at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000–1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236–4.424), baseline secrum creatinine (SCr) ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323–3.502), CD4(+) T cell< 281 μl (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133–2.900), and intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen (HR = 1.951, 95% CI =1.520–2.740). Twelve (13.9%) patients died of severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The infection rate during induction therapy was high in patients with AAV. Bacterial pneumonia was the main type of infection encountered. Age at the time of diagnosis, smoking, baseline SCr ≥5.74 mg/dl, CD4(+) T cell< 281 μl, and IV-CYC therapy were identified as risk factors for infection.",

         "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome including microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA) and renal-limited vasculitis (RLV). The diagnosis of AAV is based on the presence of clinical manifestations with characteristic histopathological findings and the presence of MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . AAV may have predominant involvement of the upper respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, skin, and nervous system. Most patients with AAV achieved remission after appropriate immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, including cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and rituximab (RTX) [8] [9] [10] [11] . Nevertheless, infection after immunosuppressive therapy contributes to the most common cause of death. The burden of infectious disease in patients with AAV has been reported [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Nonetheless, risk infectors reported so far are inconsistent. In this study, we retrospectively analysed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and discussed major infection episodes occurring during immunosuppressive therapy in a single centre. A total of 248 patients newly diagnosed with AAV and renal involvement who met the criteria of the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference [7] between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2013 at the National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases Jinling Hospital were included, among whom 194 patients had renal biopsies that showed pauci-immune necrotic and crescentic glomerulonephritis. All patients were ANCA-positive. Patients with secondary vasculitis, including Henoch-Schonlein purpura, allergy, autoimmune disease, tumour, cryoglobulinemia and infection, were not included. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or who received only non-immunosuppressive treatment for infection at the time of diagnosis of AAV were excluded from the study. Ethical statement: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital and performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in appropriate version of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed informed consent. All clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively at diagnosis and during the follow-up period, including the patients' age, gender, medical history, routine blood analysis, 24-h urine protein excretion, urinary sediment red blood cell count, serum albumin and serum creatinine (SCr), liver enzymes, immunoglobulin and T lymphocyte counts, serum ANCAs, lung involvement, Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) [16] , the usage of immunosuppressive agents, methlyprednisone pulse therapy, plasma exchange, and adverse events including major infection. Major infections were diagnosed according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4.0 in addition to clinical and radiological manifestations and microorganism cultures. None of the patients had received any immunosuppressive therapy before diagnosis. Patients without contraindication initially received intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (0.5 g, once daily, for 3 consecutive days) after diagnosis of AAV. Patients with severe manifestations of AAV underwent plasma exchange therapy. All patients received oral prednisone at a dose of 0.6-0.8 mg/ kg/day for 4 weeks, which was then tapered by 5 mg each week to 10 mg/day. Induction immunosuppressive agents included MMF 1-1.5 g/day orally, monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide (IV-CYC) at 0.75-1.0 g/m 2 body surface area in monthly pulses, tripterygium glycosides (TW, extract from the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii, which mainly contains triptolide) and multi-target therapy (prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus) [8] . Maintenance therapy included prednisone 5 mg/day combined with MMF and azathioprine. Prophylaxis of Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) with SMZ-CO (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 400/80 0.48 g per day) was used in patients whose CD4 + T cell counts were less than 200/μl, and the doses were tapered in patients with renal dysfunction [17] . All immunosuppressive agents, except prednisone, were discontinued in patients with AAV who suffered from major infection during the follow-up period. Antimicrobial therapy was prescribed according to clinical and radiological manifestations and microbiological characteristics. Patients diagnosed with PJP were treated with SMZ-CO and echinocandin together. Patients with weight loss were prescribed enteral nutrition. The patients with severe acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were treated with continuous blood purification. A recorded severe infectious complication was defined as implying the administration of an antimicrobial medication for an observable clinical, microbiological and radiologic suspected infection requiring hospitalization. Immediate dialysis was defined as the clinical necessity of renal replacement therapy on admission. The first immunosuppressive agent used in addition to corticosteroids was termed induction therapy. The immunosuppressive regimen used during follow-up was termed the maintenance agent. The diagnosis criteria for deep fungal infection included clinical manifestations, such as fever, cough, diarrhoea or lower urinary tract symptoms, and the detection of fungi in sputum, urine, stool or tissue specimens. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was diagnosed by CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The range of quantification of this assay was 600-100,000 copies/ml for CMV. CMV pneumonia was defined as the detection of ground glass opacity by chest X-ray film or computed tomography, the detection of CMV in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung tissue samples, and clinical signs such as fever, cough, dyspnoea and hypoxemia. The diagnosis of PJP was made clinically or by the identification of Pneumocystis from sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, tracheal secretions or lung tissue by special stains or a non-nested PCR, specifically designed to diagnose pneumonia rather than colonization [18] . ARDS was defined as the acute onset of hypoxemia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen [P aO2 /F IO2 ] ≤ 200 mmHg) with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs, without left atrial hypertension. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was defined as the simultaneous failure of at least two organs. ESRD was defined as eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73m 2 or requiring renal replacement treatment for > 3 months. The follow-up endpoints included the final date of December 31, 2014, dropping out before the final date, reaching ESRD, or death. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Medians and ranges were reported for non-normally distributed data, and means ± standard deviations were reported for normal-distributed data. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied for the comparison of non-normal distributed data. Differences between means were tested using the Student's t-test. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonparametric distributions. Chi-squared tests were used for the comparison of categorical data. To address the independent predictive value of factors associated with the rate of infections, the variables with P values of less than 0.1 in univariate analysis as well as those reported in the literature were selected for multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model. The group with corticosteroids only was used as a reference group in multivariate analysis. Only the time to first severe infection was evaluated. Laboratory values and BVAS used for modelling were from the time of diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-offs of SCr, haemoglobin, albumin, CD4+ T cells and BVAS. All tests were two-tailed, and P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated at the 95% level. This study identified 248 individuals with ages ranging from 14 to 78 years (median 55 years), including 214 cases diagnosed as MPA, 16 cases diagnosed as RLV, 10 cases diagnosed as GPA and 8 cases diagnosed as EGPA. Seventy-five patients (30.2%) showed lung involvement, 30 (12.1%) had alveolar haemorrhage, and 54 (21.8%) had sinus involvement. MPO-ANCA was more prevalent, and only 21 cases (8.5%) were PR3-ANCA-positive. Fifty-three patients started immediate dialysis. Initial immunosuppressive treatment consisted of pulse methylprednisolone (67.3%), plasma exchange (23.8%), IV-CYC (26.6%), MMF (31.0%) and TW (16.1%). Twenty-six percent of patients received only oral corticosteroids (Table 1) . Forty-two patients (16.5%) received SMZ-CO to prevent PJP, and 29 of them were CYC users. A total of 103 infectious episodes occurred in 86 patients (34.7%) during follow-up for 1~155 months (median 15 months). Fifteen cases experienced a second episode of infection, and one patient experienced a third episode. Seventy-six episodes (73.8%) of infection occurred during induction therapy (median 1.5 months). Twenty-seven episodes (26.2%) occurred during maintenance therapy (median 18 months), and six episodes (5.8%) occurred after 24 months. Pulmonary infections (71.8%, 74/103) were the most frequent type of infection, followed by skin (n = 7, 6.8%), digestive tract (n = 3, 2.9%), urinary tract (n = 2, 1.9%) and central nervous system (n = 1, 1.0%) infections. Six patients (5.8%) developed sepsis because of their reported infection. The pathogens responsible for infection were confirmed in 87 episodes. The whole pathogen spectrum included bacteria, fungi and viruses. Bacterial infection was the most common (n = 57, 66%), especially Acinetobacter baumannii, followed by fungal (n = 21, 24%) and viral infections (n = 9, 10%) There were four CMV, seven PJP and 16 unspecified infections (Table 2) . The infectious rate of induction therapy with corticosteroids only was 38.5% (25/65), that for CS + IV-CYC was 39.0% (26/66), CS + MMF was 33.8% (26/77) and CS + TW was 22.5% (9/40). The incidence of smoking (36.0% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.000) and diabetes (8.1% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.032) was significantly higher among the infected patients. The cutoff level of SCr haemoglobin, albumin, CD4+ T cells, and BVAS were determined as 5.74 mg/dl, 7.75 g/dl, 33.95 g/l, 281/ul, and 25.5 respectively based on ROC curve analysis. Single factor analysis revealed that risk factors for complicated infection in patients with AAV included age, smoking, pulmonary involvement, hemoglobulin, albumin, SCr level, CD4 + T cell count, BVAS, and immunosuppressive therapy with MMF, CYC and TW. In adjusted models for the AAV cohort, increased risks of infection were observed in patients who were older at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000-1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236-4.424), with baseline Scr ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323-3.502), CD4 + T cell< 281 μl (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133-2.900), and users of intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen (HR = 1.951, 95% CI =1.520-2.740) ( Table 3) . The exact pathogen was identified in 44 of 82 episodes of pneumonia. Bacteria were the most common pathogens (n = 27, 61.4%), especially Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6, 13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5, 18.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 6.0%). Thirteen cases were diagnosed as fungal infections, and most were caused by C. albicans (n = 8, 61.5%). CMV was identified in all four cases with viral pneumonia. The main pulmonary radiologic findings included consolidation (n = 38, 51.4%), diffuse interstitial pneumonia (n = 21, 28.4%) and multiple nodules (n = 13, 17.6%). Bacterial pneumonia presented with consolidation (n = 24, 32.4%), nodules (n = 9, 12.2%) and a diffuse reticular pattern (n = 6, 8.1%). CMV pneumonia mainly presented with ground-glass opacities (4, 5.4%), diffuse reticular thickening (n = 3, 4.1%) and nodules (n = 1, 1.4%) on bilateral lungs. Fungal pneumonia was characterized by consolidation (n = 14, 18.9%), nodules (n = 4, 5.4%), halo (n = 4, 5.4%) and air crescent sign (n = 2, 2.7%). Thirteen cases were complicated by ARDS, and 10 were complicated by MODS. Nine patients required mechanical respiration (5 BiPAP and 4 endotracheal intubation). All 103 episodes were treated with intravenous antibiotics. Twelve (11.7%) of 103 patients died and all due to severe pneumonia. The time to death was from one to sixteen months after the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. None died due to AAV (Table 4 ). A link between vasculitis and infection has long been suspected. Bacterial infections can trigger the production of various autoantibodies, including ANCA [19] . Infection is a major concern in the management of AAV and is the most common cause of death, especially in patients with malnutrition or immunosuppressive therapy [1] [2] [3] . Immunosuppressive therapy is performed with consideration of the disease activity, which is comprehensively evaluated based on the BVAS score [20] . Nonetheless, even in patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis, secondary infection, rather than active AAV, is the leading cause of death [21] . There still remains no firm conclusion about the burden and characteristics of major infections in patients with AAV. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of 248 Chinese patients with AAV. Major infections were reported in 34.6% of our single-centre cohort. Approximately 64.1% of these infections developed in the first three months of induction therapy. In the reported studies, corticosteroids contributed to 89% of infections of patients with AAV, and the infection rate decreased when the corticosteroids were tapered [1] [2] [3] [4] . Corticosteroid treatment leads to an immunocompromised status in patients by inhibiting cytokines, neutrophils, and immunologic response and by exerting anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [22] . Infection is suspected when fever (≥37.3°C) persists for no less than three days and C-reactive protein increases after remission of AAV [22] . The evaluation of infection is based on the presence of organ manifestations. Identificating methods of causative microorganisms, such as common bacteria, viruses, and fungi, include mycological, histological, and genetic tests [20] . The main areas of infection included the lungs and skin. The lung infection rate was as high as 79.6% in this cohort. Most AAV patients had impaired renal function, and lung involvement and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage injure the local protective barrier. Renal injury also increases the risk of severe infection and is closely associated with a poor outcome [6, 18] . According to the literature, the most common causative pathogens are bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza [23, 24] , followed by fungi and viruses. In our cohort, the main bacteria included Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 2) , and our rates of infections with fungi and viruses were higher and lower, respectively, than those of previous reports [25] . Characteristics of AAV, such as global inflammation, renal injury, lung involvement, malnutrition, and immunosuppressive therapy, contribute to infections by opportunistic pathogens [26] . CMV, PJP and 13 cases of pneumomycosis developed during induction therapy. It is also possible that a PJP diagnosis may have been [27] [28] [29] . Thus, improving the vaccination coverage against streptococcus pneumonia and influenza in high-risk populations could play an important role in pulmonary prevention [30] . The most common computed tomography findings were ground-glass attenuation, reticular pattern, and fibrous bands with infiltration. In cases of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia, a consolidation and reticular pattern, patchy consolidation and glass-ground attenuation were most commonly observed, respectively. These characteristics are predominantly seen in pneumonia patients with AAV. Given the high incidence of infections in patients with AAV, risk factors need to be defined in order to increase surveillance and prescribe prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Many studies have reported that age, female gender, diabetes, impaired renal function, clinical grade category of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), lymphopenia and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for infection in AAV [6, 12-14, 20, 31] . However, there remains no consensus about the infectious risk factors in Chinese patients with AAV. In this cohort, BVAS and the frequency of diabetes in the infectious group were higher than that in the control group, indicating that higher BVAS and diabetes are potential risk factors of infection. Age at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000-1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236-4.424), baseline Scr ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323-3.502), CD4 + T cell< 281 ul (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133-2.900), and use of intravenous CYC were independent risk factors of infection. Whether or not the use of CYC was a risk factor for developing infection in AAV patients remains controversial [9, 10, 14] . Masaharu [20] also reported that the use of CYC was a risk factor for developing infection in AAV patients, but no difference was observed in renal failure between those with or without infection. On the other hand, CYC showed similar adverse events when compared to Rituximab in two randomized controlled trials [9, 10] . In our study, the infection-related mortality (11.7%) was less than that reported in most of the literatures [4, 13, 14, 32] . Half of these cases died within the first month after diagnosis. Thus, clinicians should consider adaptive immunosuppressive agents to avoid life-threatening infection. There are some limitations in this retrospective study. First, the treatment protocols were not uniform and lack of data on Rituximab. Only a minority of patients were given SMZ-CO prophylaxis because of the insufficient awareness. None of these patients received prophylaxis for fungal infection. In addition, some cases with pulmonary or central nervous system infection failed to show a definitive pathogen. The frequency and severity of pneumonia should be lowered by prophylactic treatment and early diagnosis. Infections can develop during every stage of AAV, primarily in the lungs and skin. The pathogens identified in this study mainly consisted of bacteria, candidiasis, CMV and herpes simplex virus, and age at the diagnosis, smoking, baseline SCr higher than 5.74 mg/dl, CD4 + T cell< 281 μl, and CYC therapy were independent risk factors for infection in patients with AAV.",
         "Risk factors for infectious complications of ANCA-associated vasculitis: a cohort study. BACKGROUND: Severe infections are common complications of immunosuppressive treatment for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) with renal involvement. We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors of severe infection in Chinese patients with AAV after immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: A total of 248 patients with a new diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis were included in this study. The incidence, time, site, and risk factors of severe infection by the induction therapies were analysed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 103 episodes of severe infection were identified in 86 (34.7%, 86/248) patients during a median follow-up of 15 months. The incidence of infection during induction therapy was 38.5% for corticosteroids (CS), 39.0% for CS+ intravenous cyclophosphamide (IV-CYC), 33.8% for CS+ mycophenolate mofetil and 22.5% for CS + tripterygium glycosides, 76 (73.8%) infection episodes occurred within 6 months, while 66 (64.1%) occurred within 3 months. Pneumonia (71.8%, 74/103) was the most frequent type of infection, and the main pathogenic spectrum included bacteria (78.6%), fungi (12.6%), and viruses (8.7%). The risk factors associated with infection were age at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000–1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236–4.424), baseline secrum creatinine (SCr) ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323–3.502), CD4(+) T cell< 281 μl (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133–2.900), and intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen (HR = 1.951, 95% CI =1.520–2.740). Twelve (13.9%) patients died of severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The infection rate during induction therapy was high in patients with AAV. Bacterial pneumonia was the main type of infection encountered. Age at the time of diagnosis, smoking, baseline SCr ≥5.74 mg/dl, CD4(+) T cell< 281 μl, and IV-CYC therapy were identified as risk factors for infection.. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome including microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA) and renal-limited vasculitis (RLV).

Initial immunosuppressive treatment consisted of pulse methylprednisolone (67.3%), plasma exchange (23.8%), IV-CYC (26.6%), MMF (31.0%) and TW (16.1%). Twenty-six percent of patients received only oral corticosteroids (Table 1) . Forty-two patients (16.5%) received SMZ-CO to prevent PJP, and 29 of them were CYC users. A total of 103 infectious episodes occurred in 86 patients (34.7%) during follow-up for 1~155 months (median 15 months). Fifteen cases experienced a second episode of infection, and one patient experienced a third episode. Seventy-six episodes (73.8%) of infection occurred during induction therapy (median 1.5 months). Twenty-seven episodes (26.2%) occurred during maintenance therapy (median 18 months), and six episodes (5.8%) occurred after 24 months. Pulmonary infections (71.8%, 74/103) were the most frequent type of infection, followed by skin (n = 7, 6.8%), digestive tract (n = 3, 2.9%), urinary tract (n = 2, 1.9%) and central nervous system (n = 1, 1.0%) infections. Six patients (5.8%) developed sepsis because of their reported infection. The pathogens responsible for infection were confirmed in 87 episodes. The whole pathogen spectrum included bacteria, fungi and viruses. Bacterial infection was the most common (n = 57, 66%), especially Acinetobacter baumannii, followed by fungal (n = 21, 24%) and viral infections (n = 9, 10%) There were four CMV, seven PJP and 16 unspecified infections (Table 2) . The infectious rate of induction therapy with corticosteroids only was 38.5% (25/65), that for CS + IV-CYC was 39.0% (26/66), CS + MMF was 33.8% (26/77) and CS + TW was 22.5% (9/40). The incidence of smoking (36.0% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.000) and diabetes (8.1% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.032) was significantly higher among the infected patients. The cutoff level of SCr haemoglobin, albumin, CD4+ T cells, and BVAS were determined as 5.74 mg/dl, 7.75 g/dl, 33.95 g/l, 281/ul, and 25.5 respectively based on ROC curve analysis. Single factor analysis revealed that risk factors for complicated infection in patients with AAV included age, smoking, pulmonary involvement, hemoglobulin, albumin, SCr level, CD4 + T cell count, BVAS, and immunosuppressive therapy with MMF, CYC and TW. In adjusted models for the AAV cohort, increased risks of infection were observed in patients who were older at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000-1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236-4.424), with baseline Scr ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323-3.502), CD4 + T cell< 281 μl (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133-2.900), and users of intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen (HR = 1.951, 95% CI =1.520-2.740) ( Table 3) . The exact pathogen was identified in 44 of 82 episodes of pneumonia. Bacteria were the most common pathogens (n = 27, 61.4%), especially Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6, 13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5, 18.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 6.0%). Thirteen cases were diagnosed as fungal infections, and most were caused by C. albicans (n = 8, 61.5%). CMV was identified in all four cases with viral pneumonia. The main pulmonary radiologic findings included consolidation (n = 38, 51.4%), diffuse interstitial pneumonia (n = 21, 28.4%) and multiple nodules (n = 13, 17.6%). Bacterial pneumonia presented with consolidation (n = 24, 32.4%), nodules (n = 9, 12.2%) and a diffuse reticular pattern (n = 6, 8.1%). CMV pneumonia mainly presented with ground-glass opacities (4, 5.4%), diffuse reticular thickening (n = 3, 4.1%) and nodules (n = 1, 1.4%) on bilateral lungs. Fungal pneumonia was characterized by consolidation (n = 14, 18.9%), nodules (n = 4, 5.4%), halo (n = 4, 5.4%) and air crescent sign (n = 2, 2.7%). Thirteen cases were complicated by ARDS, and 10 were complicated by MODS. Nine patients required mechanical respiration (5 BiPAP and 4 endotracheal intubation). All 103 episodes were treated with intravenous antibiotics. Twelve (11.7%) of 103 patients died and all due to severe pneumonia. The time to death was from one to sixteen months after the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. None died due to AAV (Table 4 ). A link between vasculitis and infection has long been suspected. Bacterial infections can trigger the production of various autoantibodies, including ANCA [19] . Infection is a major concern in the management of AAV and is the most common cause of death, especially in patients with malnutrition or immunosuppressive therapy [1] [2] [3] . Immunosuppressive therapy is performed with consideration of the disease activity, which is comprehensively evaluated based on the BVAS score [20] . Nonetheless, even in patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis, secondary infection, rather than active AAV, is the leading cause of death [21] . There still remains no firm conclusion about the burden and characteristics of major infections in patients with AAV. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of 248 Chinese patients with AAV. Major infections were reported in 34.6% of our single-centre cohort. Approximately 64.1% of these infections developed in the first three months of induction therapy. In the reported studies, corticosteroids contributed to 89% of infections of patients with AAV, and the infection rate decreased when the corticosteroids were tapered [1] [2] [3] [4] . Corticosteroid treatment leads to an immunocompromised status in patients by inhibiting cytokines, neutrophils, and immunologic response and by exerting anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [22] . Infection is suspected when fever (≥37.3°C) persists for no less than three days and C-reactive protein increases after remission of AAV [22] . The evaluation of infection is based on the presence of organ manifestations. Identificating methods of causative microorganisms, such as common bacteria, viruses, and fungi, include mycological, histological, and genetic tests [20] . The main areas of infection included the lungs and skin. The lung infection rate was as high as 79.6% in this cohort. Most AAV patients had impaired renal function, and lung involvement and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage injure the local protective barrier. Renal injury also increases the risk of severe infection and is closely associated with a poor outcome [6, 18] . According to the literature, the most common causative pathogens are bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza [23, 24] , followed by fungi and viruses. In our cohort, the main bacteria included Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 2) , and our rates of infections with fungi and viruses were higher and lower, respectively, than those of previous reports [25] . Characteristics of AAV, such as global inflammation, renal injury, lung involvement, malnutrition, and immunosuppressive therapy, contribute to infections by opportunistic pathogens [26] . CMV, PJP and 13 cases of pneumomycosis developed during induction therapy. It is also possible that a PJP diagnosis may have been [27] [28] [29] . Thus, improving the vaccination coverage against streptococcus pneumonia and influenza in high-risk populations could play an important role in pulmonary prevention [30] . The most common computed tomography findings were ground-glass attenuation, reticular pattern, and fibrous bands with infiltration. In cases of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia, a consolidation and reticular pattern, patchy consolidation and glass-ground attenuation were most commonly observed, respectively. These characteristics are predominantly seen in pneumonia patients with AAV. Given the high incidence of infections in patients with AAV, risk factors need to be defined in order to increase surveillance and prescribe prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Many studies have reported that age, female gender, diabetes, impaired renal function, clinical grade category of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), lymphopenia and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for infection in AAV [6, 12-14, 20, 31] . However, there remains no consensus about the infectious risk factors in Chinese patients with AAV. In this cohort, BVAS and the frequency of diabetes in the infectious group were higher than that in the control group, indicating that higher BVAS and diabetes are potential risk factors of infection. Age at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.003, 95% CI = 1.000-1.006), smoking (HR = 2.338, 95% CI = 1.236-4.424), baseline Scr ≥5.74 mg/dl (HR = 2.153, 95% CI = 1.323-3.502), CD4 + T cell< 281 ul (HR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.133-2.900), and use of intravenous CYC were independent risk factors of infection. Whether or not the use of CYC was a risk factor for developing infection in AAV patients remains controversial [9, 10, 14] . Masaharu [20] also reported that the use of CYC was a risk factor for developing infection in AAV patients, but no difference was observed in renal failure between those with or without infection. On the other hand, CYC showed similar adverse events when compared to Rituximab in two randomized controlled trials [9, 10] . In our study, the infection-related mortality (11.7%) was less than that reported in most of the literatures [4, 13, 14, 32] . Half of these cases died within the first month after diagnosis. Thus, clinicians should consider adaptive immunosuppressive agents to avoid life-threatening infection. There are some limitations in this retrospective study. First, the treatment protocols were not uniform and lack of data on Rituximab. Only a minority of patients were given SMZ-CO prophylaxis because of the insufficient awareness. None of these patients received prophylaxis for fungal infection. In addition, some cases with pulmonary or central nervous system infection failed to show a definitive pathogen. The frequency and severity of pneumonia should be lowered by prophylactic treatment and early diagnosis. Infections can develop during every stage of AAV, primarily in the lungs and skin. The pathogens identified in this study mainly consisted of bacteria, candidiasis, CMV and herpes simplex virus, and age at the diagnosis, smoking, baseline SCr higher than 5.74 mg/dl, CD4 + T cell< 281 μl, and CYC therapy were independent risk factors for infection in patients with AAV.",

         "The Differential Effects of Alcohol and Nicotine-Specific Nitrosamine Ketone on White Matter Ultrastructure",
         "AIMS: The chronic consumption of alcohol is known to result in neurodegeneration and impairment of cognitive function. Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.",

         "Alcohol and tobacco are widely used and abused substances that are both high-risk factors for multiple diseases and significant global burdens on healthcare systems. A considerable amount of research demonstrates that alcohol has a degenerative effect on the brain with chronic consumption ultimately leading to alcoholrelated brain damage (ARBD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive function including decreased working memory and problem solving ability (Brust, 2010) . Early pathological studies of alcoholics found that brain volume reduction was largely due to loss of white matter (WM) (Sutherland et al., 2014; Harper and Kril, 1985; De la Monte, 1988) . Neurodegenerative effects are also seen but, in alcoholics without concomitant thiamine deficiency, these tend to be restricted to the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997) . These findings have been confirmed by neuroimaging studies with the changes being, at least partially, reversible with abstinence (Buhler and Mann, 2011; Pfefferbaum et al., 2014) . Chronic tobacco smoking has been associated with impairments in executive functions (Razani et al., 2004) , general intellectual abilities (Deary et al., 2003) , learning and memory (Ernst et al., 2001; Schinka et al., 2003) and cognitive flexibility (Kalmijn et al., 2002) . However, unlike ARBD, there is no consensus on the effects on brain atrophy with previous studies reporting increased temporal (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) and cingulate WM volumes (Yu et al., 2011) , or no significant change in WM volume (Durazzo et al., 2007; Gallinat et al., 2006; Paul, 2008 #7360) . However, decreased WM integrity has been consistently reported (Paul et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, it is unclear what component(s) of tobacco smoke might be responsible. There are more than 4000 toxic compounds in tobacco smoke including carbon monoxide, aldehydes and dihydroxybenzenes. There are also several kinds of tobacco specific nitrosamines, of which 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridyl)-1-butanone (also known as nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK)) is the most studied. Most studies have focused on NNK's carcinogenic effects but sub-mutagenic doses (2 mg/kg), that are known to be hepatotoxic (Zabala et al., 2015) , may also have neurodegenerative effects, as seen with other nitrosamines such as streptozotocin (Lester-Coll et al., 2006) . ARBD is likely to result from a variable interaction between the direct and indirect effects of alcohol on the brain combined with cosubstance abuse, malnutrition, head trauma and systemic disease. It has been estimated that more than 80% of chronic alcoholics regularly smoke tobacco (Kalman et al., 2005) and recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that a proportion of the damage seen in ARBD is due to smoking (Gazdzinski et al., 2005; Luhar et al., 2013; Durazzo et al., 2014) . To date, there has been only one pathological study looking at how chronic tobacco smoking affects the human brain (McCorkindale et al., 2016) . Experimental models of chronic alcohol and smoking behaviour, where there is strict control of dose and elimination of confounding variables, allow direct effects to be measured more accurately. De La Monte and colleagues have developed a rat model of chronic/binge alcohol and NNK consumption (Zabala et al., 2015) . They have recently used this model to show that oligodendroglial gene and protein expression is perturbed by coexposure and that this likely leads to impaired myelin synthesis (Tong et al., 2015b) . Here, we extend this work by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate whether myelin ultrastructure is affected in these rats and the relative effects of alcohol versus NNK. All animal experiments were carried out at The Rhode Island Hospital-Alpert Medical School of Brown University following approval the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee at the Lifespan-Rhode Island Hospital, and conformed to the National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines. The Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of University of Sydney approved the subsequent use of brain tissue samples. The alcohol/NNK model used here has been previously published (Zabala et al., 2015) and this study is part of a larger programme to examine the combined effects of alcohol and NNK on liver (Zabala et al., 2015) and brain function (Tong et al., 2015a, b) . Briefly, 39 1-month-old (adolescent) Long Evans (male) rats were administered isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 26% ethanol (alcohol) by caloric content (0% or 6% v/v) for a period of 2 months (8 weeks). The liquid diets were refreshed daily and as this was not a behaviour-based alcohol consumption experiment the rats did not have a choice between ethanol-containing and ethanol-free diets. Residual food was measured at 10 am each day to monitor food intake. To ensure equivalent caloric intake, the volumes of liquid diet supplied were balanced based on inter-group differences in the amounts consumed, although both groups consumed all of the food supplied each day. From Week 3 until Week 8, rats in each group (n = 9 or 10) were administered intraperitoneal NNK (2 mg/kg) or saline on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. In Weeks 7 and 8, ethanol-treated rats were binged with 2 g/kg ethanol (100 µl, intraperitoneal) on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays or saline for the controls. Binge administration of ethanol increased the blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) by 2-to 4-fold (mean 70 mg dl −1 chronic to 240, albeit this was slightly lower with NNK + ethanol treatment (200 mg dl −1 ) (Zabala et al., 2015) ). The rats were euthanized with isofluorane and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Their frontal lobes were dissected out and a representative WM tissue block removed and fixed by immersion in modified Karnovsky's fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for TEM. Tissue samples were washed and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ), dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin for sectioning. Three ultrathin sections (70 nm) were obtained from each block and placed on copper mesh grids. Sections were subsequently stained with dilute uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All sections were examined on a JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at 120 kV at Sydney Microscopy and Microanalysis, University of Sydney. All TEM images were captured using a highresolution Gatan digital CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, United States) and imported into open source GIMP (version 2.9.1, www.gimp.org) for adjustment of contrast and Image J (version 150b, wsr@nih.gov) for quantitation. TEM images were obtained in a random but systematic fashion. The field of view in the top left part of the section and a series of fields imaged by moving in a clockwise direction at random intervals. The accuracy of fibre counts was determined using a count-recount process on selected images from the control group. Otherwise the rater was blind to group status. Low magnification (3000×) images were imported into Image J. Images were divided into six equal square areas and an unbiased counting frame (100 μm 2 ) placed in the centre of each square. Each image was then examined in a systematic and uniform manner using a cell counter application in Image J. Myelinated fibres were counted if they were inside the counting frame, touching an inclusion line, were round or elliptical in cross section and free of artefacts such as sheath unravelling (Fig. 1A) . For each section the myelinated fibres were counted in five TEM fields (1140 μm 2 per field, at 3000×) of three sections per rat (15 images per rat, approximately 150 images per treatment group) and standardized to the mean number of myelinated fibres per 100 μm 2 . High magnification (30,000×) images were imported into Image J and the diameter of 10 randomly chosen myelinated fibres measured from three sections per rat. Fibres were also classified as small, medium and large as previously described (Liu and Schumann, 2014) and based on the fibre size distribution of the controls only (Fig. 1A) . high-resolution electron micrograph shows the features measured to derive the four indices. Myelinated and unmyelinated (black arrows) fibres were enumerated in 3000× and 15,000× magnified digital images, respectively. The diameter of those myelinated fibres (long dashed lines) in, or approximately in, cross section were measured using the image analysis software, Image J. Myelin sheath thickness was calculated by subtracting the axon diameter (short dashed lines) from the fibre diameter and dividing the difference by two. Myelinated fibres that were not in cross section (asterisks) were excluded from the analysis. Scale bar 0.5 μm. Box plots demonstrate the effect of ethanol (ET), NNK and NNK + ethanol on (B) mean myelinated fibre density and (C) mean myelinated fibre diameter. Each plot represents the mean data from 10 rats (or 9 in the combined treatment group) while the box itself shows the median and 75% and 25% quartiles. The whiskers define data that fall within the following range: third quartile + 1.5*(interquartile range) and first quartile -1.5*(interquartile range). (D) A mosaic histogram shows the distribution of small (≤ 0.42 μm, white), medium (> 0.42 ≤ 0.6 μm, grey) and large (> 0.6 μm, black) myelinated fibres in the ethanol (ET)-, NNK-, co-treated and control groups. All graphs were generated with JMP version. 10.0.0. Box plots demonstrate (E) myelin sheath diameter and (F) unmyelinated fibre diameter. High magnification (30,000×) images were imported into Image J and the diameter of the axon and whole fibre measured and sheath thickness calculated. Ten myelinated fibres were counted per section, 30 per rat. Myelinated fibres that had unravelled or disrupted sheaths were excluded (Fig. 1A) . The density of unmyelinated fibres was obtained in a similar fashion to myelinated fibre density but from mid-range magnification (15,000×) images for accurate visualization. Furthermore fibres quantified across the whole field rather than within unbiased counting frames. Five fields were counted in three sections, 15 per rat. All counts were standardized to unmyelinated fibres per 100 μm 2 . Statistical analyses were performed using the JMP PRO statistical software program (Version 9.0.0, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The distribution of data was determined with goodness of fit tests (Shapiro-Wilk). For each index differences were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc analysis between individual groups assessed using ANOVA or nonparametric testing (Wilcoxon) if data were not normally distributed. A Chi-squared test was used to assess potential differences in fibre size classes (small, medium and large). Data are reported as mean per treatment ± standard deviation and results of post-hoc analyses considered statistically significant at an adjusted α-level of 0.02 to allow for multiple comparisons. A total of 39 Long Evans rats underwent experimental paradigms simulating the chronic/binge pattern of alcohol drinking behaviour (Naimi et al., 2003; Seth et al., 2011) and comorbid smoking (Kalman et al., 2005) . Long Evans rats are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol on the liver (Yeon et al., 2003; Denucci et al., 2010) and brain (Miura et al., 2008; de la Monte et al., 2009) . Intraperitoneal administration of ethanol increases the likelihood of oxidative damage compared with oral gavage (Nogales et al., 2014) . NNK was chosen as a proxy for tobacco smoke exposure as it is the prominent nitrosamine in tobacco smoke and other nitrosamines such as streptozotocin (Lester-Coll et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 2009 ) are known to be neurotoxic. In this model, BAC increased 4-fold from a mean of 70-240 mg dl −1 following binge doses, although maximum BAC was slightly lower with combined NNK treatment (200 mg dl −1 ) (Zabala et al., 2015) . The rats were divided into subgroups composed of 10 controls, 10 NNK-treated, 10 ethanol-treated and nine NNK + ethanol-treated and four WM integrity indices measured on digital TEM images: myelinated fibre density, unmyelinated fibre density, myelinated fibre size and sheath thickness. There was a significant difference in mean myelinated fibre density between the four groups (P < 0.0001) with independent effects of ethanol (P < 0.0001) and NNK (P < 0.0001) along with an interaction between the two treatments (P < 0.0004) (Figs 1B and 2) . In comparison to the control group (55.6 ± 9.4, per 100 μm 2 ), there was a 35% decrease in myelinated fibre density in ethanol-treated rats (36.3 ± 12.0, per 100 μm 2 ; P < 0.0001), a 36% decrease in NNK-treated rats (35.7 ± 3.2, per 100 μm 2 ; P < 0.0001) and a 44% decrease in the rats exposed to both NNK and ethanol (24.6 ± 4.8, per 100 μm 2 ; P < 0.0001). The combined treatment group had significantly fewer myelinated fibres than either treatment group alone (P < 0.004 and P < 0.006). There was no difference between the NNK and ethanol-treated groups. There were no differences in mean fibre diameter between the four groups (Fig. 1C ). There were also no group differences in fibre size classes (small, medium and large; P = 0.14), although the percentage of large fibres was lowest in the ethanol-treated group (14%, P = 0.06) compared with controls (19%), NNK-treated (16%) and co-treated animals (16%) (Fig. 1D ). There was a difference in myelin sheath thickness between the four groups (P = 0.004) with pairwise analyses showed thinning in NNK-treated groups (both −17%; P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0008 (combined)) compared to controls (Fig. 1E) . The NNK-treated group was also significantly thinner than the ethanol-treated group (P = 0.02) that was, in turn, similar to the control group (−8%, P = 0.07). As unmyelinated fibres without an electron dense sheath were more difficult to discern in TEM micrographs they were quantified in 15,000× images (15 per rat) or approximately 5-fold less sampling, by area, than for myelinated fibres. There was a significant difference in unmyelinated fibre density between the treatment groups (P = 0.003) (Fig. 1F) . Pairwise analyses showed that only ethanoltreated animals significantly differed from controls (P = 0.01). A two-way ANOVA revealed an interaction of NNK and ethanol (P = 0.001) with co-exposed animals demonstrating the smallest reduction in unmyelinated fibres (2%) compared to NNK-(8%) and ethanol-treated animals (16%). This study examined the effect of chronic alcohol and NNK exposure on frontal lobe WM integrity in male Long Evans rats at an ultrastructural level. The results suggest a synergistic effect between the two exposures on myelinated fibre density but more complex interactions with other WM indices. In particular, the tobacco smoke component, NNK, appeared to specifically target the myelin sheath while the majority of ethanol's effects appear to be directed at the axonal (neuronal) component of WM. In the narrow sense of the term, NNK may not be neurodegenerative as its effects on WM appear to be confined to myelin integrity. Assuming that NNK is a reasonable proxy for tobacco smoke, then the findings here are consistent with human neuroimaging studies that showed smoking had an adverse effect on WM, and in particular decreased frontal lobe WM integrity (Zhang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, these results are consistent with studies that demonstrated that smoking leads to impaired cognitive function (Durazzo et al., 2007; Deary et al., 2003; Gazdzinski et al., 2005) . There seemed to be a subtle difference in the mechanism of action of ethanol versus NNK on the rat brain. Ethanol had no effect on myelin sheath thickness but had a similar effect to NNK on myelinated fibre density. In contrast ethanol was the only treatment to affect unmyelinated fibre density. Notwithstanding there was less sampling of unmyelinated fibres in the study, it does appear that ethanol, but not NNK, is directly neurotoxic. These results are consistent with the widespread WM loss seen in ARBD (de la Monte, 1988; Kril et al., 1997; Sutherland et al., 2014) . In the absence of TEM studies on ARBD the effect of ethanol on unmyelinated fibres appears consistent with the moderate but localized GM atrophy and neuronal loss seen in areas such as the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997) . The deleterious effect of ethanol and NNK on myelinated fibres may represent a double hit on the neuronal and oligodendroglial (myelin) components, respectively, of the myelinated fibres. Whereas the disparate effects on unmyelinated fibres suggest that in the absence of myelin, NNK can attenuate ethanol neurotoxicity. These results are generally consistent with neuroimaging studies. A MRI study by Gazdzinski et al. (2005) found significant GM losses in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes in alcoholics (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) . When this group re-analysed their results they found that these reductions were largely found in smoking alcoholics compared rather than non-smoking alcoholics (Durazzo et al., 2007) . These findings, along with greater WM loss also in smoking alcoholics, have since been replicated (Luhar et al., 2013; Durazzo et al., 2014) . In terms of a sparing effect of smoking on neuronal damage, our own work using autopsy tissue suggested trends towards increased volume in smokers in two GM regions (the supramarginal and sensory cortex) but there was no correlation to smoking pack-years (McCorkindale et al., 2016) . The findings here support a synergistic effect, although not strictly additive, of ethanol and NNK on WM injury in this rat model. These findings are consistent with those of De La Monte and colleagues who demonstrated with light microscopy in the same tissue that NNK and ethanol combined caused the loss of myelinated fibres and impaired memory and spatial learning (Tong et al., 2015b) . Tong et al. did observe a greater effect of ethanol on myelin sheath thickness than observed here. They also showed that the combined exposures decreased the expression proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, proteolipid protein 1 and myelin basic protein in mature oligodendrocytes. Whereas there was increased expression of immature oligodendroglial genes such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide. Interestingly, ethanol blocked these inhibitory effects. Tong et al. (2015a) went onto show that sub-mutagenic doses of NNK's neurotoxic effects were associated with the downregulation of the insulin/ IGF1 signalling pathway and increased oxidative damage although not to the same degree as seen with ethanol alone. Our study was a novel exploration of the combined effects of smoking and chronic alcohol consumption on WM ultrastructure in rats. The control group can be directly compared to previous TEM studies in rats that have looked at the effects of ageing (Li et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009) , malnutrition (Olivares et al., 2012) and alcohol/ thiamine deficiency (He et al., 2006) . Yang et al. (2009) reported that myelinated fibre diameter in cortical WM increased with age and that the youngest female Long Evans rats (6 months) had a mean diameter of 0.56 μm, the same figure observed here. In contrast, Olivares et al. (2012) quantified myelinated fibres in the corpus callosum of 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats and found a mean diameter of 0.49 μm. In terms of myelin sheath thickness the current mean (0.12 μm in controls) is consistent with the mean thickness in two previous studies of 0.13 μm (He et al., 2006) and 0.12 μm (Li et al., 2008) . In particular He et al. (2007) looked at the interaction between alcohol and thiamine deficiency on myelin fibres in the corpus callosum of 18-months male Wistar alcohol-preferring rats. They found that the alcohol/thiamine deficient (pyrithamine) group had smaller fibres, lower myelinated fibre diameter, thinner myelin sheaths but greater myelinated fibre density. There were interactions between alcohol and thiamine deficiency but the latter was largely responsible for WM damage seen. He et al. suggested that a selective loss or shrinkage of large fibres was responsible for the increase in myelinated fibre density. The more subtle alcohol effects reported by He et al. may reflect the chronic, intermittent exposure over 12 months, the strain and the age of the rats. Interestingly, a previous TEM study in human postmortem tissue of chronic alcoholics also failed to show a difference in WM volume or myelinated fibre diameter (Tang et al., 2004) . However, Tang et al. did note a non-significant reduction (9%) subcortical WM in alcoholics, similar to the 11% reduction in total WM seen in a previous volumetric study by their group (Jensen and Pakkenberg, 1993) and the 12% reduction in total WM reported recently by our group (McCorkindale et al., 2016) . This study provides evidence that NNK and ethanol have a synergistic relationship that results in WM degeneration. NNK and ethanol had similar effects on most of the indices measured suggesting that their pathomechanisms overlap to some degree but NNK had a greater effect on myelin integrity while ethanol had additional axonal effects. Further work is required to determine whether these findings can be extrapolated to ultrastructural studies of postmortem tissue from smoking and non-smoking alcoholics.",
         "The Differential Effects of Alcohol and Nicotine-Specific Nitrosamine Ketone on White Matter Ultrastructure. AIMS: The chronic consumption of alcohol is known to result in neurodegeneration and impairment of cognitive function. Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.. Alcohol and tobacco are widely used and abused substances that are both high-risk factors for multiple diseases and significant global burdens on healthcare systems. A considerable amount of research demonstrates that alcohol has a degenerative effect on the brain with chronic consumption ultimately leading to alcoholrelated brain damage (ARBD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive function including decreased working memory and problem solving ability (Brust, 2010) . Early pathological studies of alcoholics found that brain volume reduction was largely due to loss of white matter (WM) (Sutherland et al., 2014; Harper and Kril, 1985; De la Monte, 1988) . Neurodegenerative effects are also seen but, in alcoholics without concomitant thiamine deficiency, these tend to be restricted to the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997) . These findings have been confirmed by neuroimaging studies with the changes being, at least partially, reversible with abstinence (Buhler and Mann, 2011; Pfefferbaum et al., 2014) . Chronic tobacco smoking has been associated with impairments in executive functions (Razani et al., 2004) , general intellectual abilities (Deary et al., 2003) , learning and memory (Ernst et al., 2001; Schinka et al., 2003) and cognitive flexibility (Kalmijn et al., 2002) . However, unlike ARBD, there is no consensus on the effects on brain atrophy with previous studies reporting increased temporal (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) and cingulate WM volumes (Yu et al., 2011) , or no significant change in WM volume (Durazzo et al., 2007; Gallinat et al., 2006; Paul, 2008 #7360) . However, decreased WM integrity has been consistently reported (Paul et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, it is unclear what component(s) of tobacco smoke might be responsible. There are more than 4000 toxic compounds in tobacco smoke including carbon monoxide, aldehydes and dihydroxybenzenes. There are also several kinds of tobacco specific nitrosamines, of which 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridyl)-1-butanone (also known as nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK)) is the most studied. Most studies have focused on NNK's carcinogenic effects but sub-mutagenic doses (2 mg/kg), that are known to be hepatotoxic (Zabala et al., 2015) , may also have neurodegenerative effects, as seen with other nitrosamines such as streptozotocin (Lester-Coll et al., 2006) . ARBD is likely to result from a variable interaction between the direct and indirect effects of alcohol on the brain combined with cosubstance abuse, malnutrition, head trauma and systemic disease. It has been estimated that more than 80% of chronic alcoholics regularly smoke tobacco (Kalman et al., 2005) and recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that a proportion of the damage seen in ARBD is due to smoking (Gazdzinski et al., 2005; Luhar et al., 2013; Durazzo et al., 2014) . To date, there has been only one pathological study looking at how chronic tobacco smoking affects the human brain (McCorkindale et al., 2016) . Experimental models of chronic alcohol and smoking behaviour, where there is strict control of dose and elimination of confounding variables, allow direct effects to be measured more accurately. De La Monte and colleagues have developed a rat model of chronic/binge alcohol and NNK consumption (Zabala et al., 2015) . They have recently used this model to show that oligodendroglial gene and protein expression is perturbed by coexposure and that this likely leads to impaired myelin synthesis (Tong et al., 2015b) . Here, we extend this work by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate whether myelin ultrastructure is affected in these rats and the relative effects of alcohol versus NNK. All animal experiments were carried out at The Rhode Island Hospital-Alpert Medical School of Brown University following approval the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee at the Lifespan-Rhode Island Hospital, and conformed to the National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines. The Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of University of Sydney approved the subsequent use of brain tissue samples. The alcohol/NNK model used here has been previously published (Zabala et al., 2015) and this study is part of a larger programme to examine the combined effects of alcohol and NNK on liver (Zabala et al., 2015) and brain function (Tong et al., 2015a, b) . Briefly, 39 1-month-old (adolescent) Long Evans (male) rats were administered isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 26% ethanol (alcohol) by caloric content (0% or 6% v/v) for a period of 2 months (8 weeks). The liquid diets were refreshed daily and as this was not a behaviour-based alcohol consumption experiment the rats did not have a choice between ethanol-containing and ethanol-free diets. Residual food was measured at 10 am each day to monitor food intake. To ensure equivalent caloric intake, the volumes of liquid diet supplied were balanced based on inter-group differences in the amounts consumed, although both groups consumed all of the food supplied each day. From Week 3 until Week 8, rats in each group (n = 9 or 10) were administered intraperitoneal NNK (2 mg/kg) or saline on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. In Weeks 7 and 8, ethanol-treated rats were binged with 2 g/kg ethanol (100 µl, intraperitoneal) on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays or saline for the controls. Binge administration of ethanol increased the blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) by 2-to 4-fold (mean 70 mg dl −1 chronic to 240, albeit this was slightly lower with NNK + ethanol treatment (200 mg dl −1 ) (Zabala et al., 2015) ). The rats were euthanized with isofluorane and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Their frontal lobes were dissected out and a representative WM tissue block removed and fixed by immersion in modified Karnovsky's fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for TEM. Tissue samples were washed and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ), dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin for sectioning. Three ultrathin sections (70 nm) were obtained from each block and placed on copper mesh grids. Sections were subsequently stained with dilute uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All sections were examined on a JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at 120 kV at Sydney Microscopy and Microanalysis, University of Sydney. All TEM images were captured using a highresolution Gatan digital CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, United States) and imported into open source GIMP (version 2.9.1, www.gimp.org) for adjustment of contrast and Image J (version 150b, wsr@nih.gov) for quantitation. TEM images were obtained in a random but systematic fashion. The field of view in the top left part of the section and a series of fields imaged by moving in a clockwise direction at random intervals. The accuracy of fibre counts was determined using a count-recount process on selected images from the control group. Otherwise the rater was blind to group status. Low magnification (3000×) images were imported into Image J. Images were divided into six equal square areas and an unbiased counting frame (100 μm 2 ) placed in the centre of each square. Each image was then examined in a systematic and uniform manner using a cell counter application in Image J. Myelinated fibres were counted if they were inside the counting frame, touching an inclusion line, were round or elliptical in cross section and free of artefacts such as sheath unravelling (Fig. 1A) . For each section the myelinated fibres were counted in five TEM fields (1140 μm 2 per field, at 3000×) of three sections per rat (15 images per rat, approximately 150 images per treatment group) and standardized to the mean number of myelinated fibres per 100 μm 2 . High magnification (30,000×) images were imported into Image J and the diameter of 10 randomly chosen myelinated fibres measured from three sections per rat. Fibres were also classified as small, medium and large as previously described (Liu and Schumann, 2014) and based on the fibre size distribution of the controls only (Fig. 1A) . high-resolution electron micrograph shows the features measured to derive the four indices. Myelinated and unmyelinated (black arrows) fibres were enumerated in 3000× and 15,000× magnified digital images, respectively. The diameter of those myelinated fibres (long dashed lines) in, or approximately in, cross section were measured using the image analysis software, Image J. Myelin sheath thickness was calculated by subtracting the axon diameter (short dashed lines) from the fibre diameter and dividing the difference by two. Myelinated fibres that were not in cross section (asterisks) were excluded from the analysis. Scale bar 0.5 μm. Box plots demonstrate the effect of ethanol (ET), NNK and NNK + ethanol on (B) mean myelinated fibre density and (C) mean myelinated fibre diameter. Each plot represents the mean data from 10 rats (or 9 in the combined treatment group) while the box itself shows the median and 75% and 25% quartiles. The whiskers define data that fall within the following range: third quartile + 1.5*(interquartile range) and first quartile -1.5*(interquartile range). (D) A mosaic histogram shows the distribution of small (≤ 0.42 μm, white), medium (> 0.42 ≤ 0.6 μm, grey) and large (> 0.6 μm, black) myelinated fibres in the ethanol (ET)-, NNK-, co-treated and control groups. All graphs were generated with JMP version. 10.0.0. Box plots demonstrate (E) myelin sheath diameter and (F) unmyelinated fibre diameter. High magnification (30,000×) images were imported into Image J and the diameter of the axon and whole fibre measured and sheath thickness calculated. Ten myelinated fibres were counted per section, 30 per rat. Myelinated fibres that had unravelled or disrupted sheaths were excluded (Fig. 1A) . The density of unmyelinated fibres was obtained in a similar fashion to myelinated fibre density but from mid-range magnification (15,000×) images for accurate visualization. Furthermore fibres quantified across the whole field rather than within unbiased counting frames. Five fields were counted in three sections, 15 per rat. All counts were standardized to unmyelinated fibres per 100 μm 2 . Statistical analyses were performed using the JMP PRO statistical software program (Version 9.0.0, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The distribution of data was determined with goodness of fit tests (Shapiro-Wilk). For each index differences were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc analysis between individual groups assessed using ANOVA or nonparametric testing (Wilcoxon) if data were not normally distributed. A Chi-squared test was used to assess potential differences in fibre size classes (small, medium and large). Data are reported as mean per treatment ± standard deviation and results of post-hoc analyses considered statistically significant at an adjusted α-level of 0.02 to allow for multiple comparisons. A total of 39 Long Evans rats underwent experimental paradigms simulating the chronic/binge pattern of alcohol drinking behaviour (Naimi et al., 2003; Seth et al., 2011) and comorbid smoking (Kalman et al., 2005) . Long Evans rats are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol on the liver (Yeon et al., 2003; Denucci et al., 2010) and brain (Miura et al., 2008; de la Monte et al., 2009) . Intraperitoneal administration of ethanol increases the likelihood of oxidative damage compared with oral gavage (Nogales et al., 2014) . NNK was chosen as a proxy for tobacco smoke exposure as it is the prominent nitrosamine in tobacco smoke and other nitrosamines such as streptozotocin (Lester-Coll et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 2009 ) are known to be neurotoxic. In this model, BAC increased 4-fold from a mean of 70-240 mg dl −1 following binge doses, although maximum BAC was slightly lower with combined NNK treatment (200 mg dl −1 ) (Zabala et al., 2015) . The rats were divided into subgroups composed of 10 controls, 10 NNK-treated, 10 ethanol-treated and nine NNK + ethanol-treated and four WM integrity indices measured on digital TEM images: myelinated fibre density, unmyelinated fibre density, myelinated fibre size and sheath thickness. There was a significant difference in mean myelinated fibre density between the four groups (P < 0.0001) with independent effects of ethanol (P < 0.0001) and NNK (P < 0.0001) along with an interaction between the two treatments (P < 0.0004) (Figs 1B and 2) . In comparison to the control group (55.6 ± 9.4, per 100 μm 2 ), there was a 35% decrease in myelinated fibre density in ethanol-treated rats (36.3 ± 12.0, per 100 μm 2 ; P < 0.0001), a 36% decrease in NNK-treated rats (35.7 ± 3.2, per 100 μm 2 ; P < 0.0001) and a 44% decrease in the rats exposed to both NNK and ethanol (24.6 ± 4.8, per 100 μm 2 ; P < 0.0001). The combined treatment group had significantly fewer myelinated fibres than either treatment group alone (P < 0.004 and P < 0.006). There was no difference between the NNK and ethanol-treated groups. There were no differences in mean fibre diameter between the four groups (Fig. 1C ). There were also no group differences in fibre size classes (small, medium and large; P = 0.14), although the percentage of large fibres was lowest in the ethanol-treated group (14%, P = 0.06) compared with controls (19%), NNK-treated (16%) and co-treated animals (16%) (Fig. 1D ). There was a difference in myelin sheath thickness between the four groups (P = 0.004) with pairwise analyses showed thinning in NNK-treated groups (both −17%; P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0008 (combined)) compared to controls (Fig. 1E) . The NNK-treated group was also significantly thinner than the ethanol-treated group (P = 0.02) that was, in turn, similar to the control group (−8%, P = 0.07). As unmyelinated fibres without an electron dense sheath were more difficult to discern in TEM micrographs they were quantified in 15,000× images (15 per rat) or approximately 5-fold less sampling, by area, than for myelinated fibres. There was a significant difference in unmyelinated fibre density between the treatment groups (P = 0.003) (Fig. 1F) . Pairwise analyses showed that only ethanoltreated animals significantly differed from controls (P = 0.01). A two-way ANOVA revealed an interaction of NNK and ethanol (P = 0.001) with co-exposed animals demonstrating the smallest reduction in unmyelinated fibres (2%) compared to NNK-(8%) and ethanol-treated animals (16%). This study examined the effect of chronic alcohol and NNK exposure on frontal lobe WM integrity in male Long Evans rats at an ultrastructural level. The results suggest a synergistic effect between the two exposures on myelinated fibre density but more complex interactions with other WM indices. In particular, the tobacco smoke component, NNK, appeared to specifically target the myelin sheath while the majority of ethanol's effects appear to be directed at the axonal (neuronal) component of WM. In the narrow sense of the term, NNK may not be neurodegenerative as its effects on WM appear to be confined to myelin integrity. Assuming that NNK is a reasonable proxy for tobacco smoke, then the findings here are consistent with human neuroimaging studies that showed smoking had an adverse effect on WM, and in particular decreased frontal lobe WM integrity (Zhang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, these results are consistent with studies that demonstrated that smoking leads to impaired cognitive function (Durazzo et al., 2007; Deary et al., 2003; Gazdzinski et al., 2005) . There seemed to be a subtle difference in the mechanism of action of ethanol versus NNK on the rat brain. Ethanol had no effect on myelin sheath thickness but had a similar effect to NNK on myelinated fibre density. In contrast ethanol was the only treatment to affect unmyelinated fibre density. Notwithstanding there was less sampling of unmyelinated fibres in the study, it does appear that ethanol, but not NNK, is directly neurotoxic. These results are consistent with the widespread WM loss seen in ARBD (de la Monte, 1988; Kril et al., 1997; Sutherland et al., 2014) . In the absence of TEM studies on ARBD the effect of ethanol on unmyelinated fibres appears consistent with the moderate but localized GM atrophy and neuronal loss seen in areas such as the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997) . The deleterious effect of ethanol and NNK on myelinated fibres may represent a double hit on the neuronal and oligodendroglial (myelin) components, respectively, of the myelinated fibres. Whereas the disparate effects on unmyelinated fibres suggest that in the absence of myelin, NNK can attenuate ethanol neurotoxicity. These results are generally consistent with neuroimaging studies. A MRI study by Gazdzinski et al. (2005) found significant GM losses in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes in alcoholics (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) . When this group re-analysed their results they found that these reductions were largely found in smoking alcoholics compared rather than non-smoking alcoholics (Durazzo et al., 2007) . These findings, along with greater WM loss also in smoking alcoholics, have since been replicated (Luhar et al., 2013; Durazzo et al., 2014) . In terms of a sparing effect of smoking on neuronal damage, our own work using autopsy tissue suggested trends towards increased volume in smokers in two GM regions (the supramarginal and sensory cortex) but there was no correlation to smoking pack-years (McCorkindale et al., 2016) . The findings here support a synergistic effect, although not strictly additive, of ethanol and NNK on WM injury in this rat model. These findings are consistent with those of De La Monte and colleagues who demonstrated with light microscopy in the same tissue that NNK and ethanol combined caused the loss of myelinated fibres and impaired memory and spatial learning (Tong et al., 2015b) . Tong et al. did observe a greater effect of ethanol on myelin sheath thickness than observed here. They also showed that the combined exposures decreased the expression proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, proteolipid protein 1 and myelin basic protein in mature oligodendrocytes. Whereas there was increased expression of immature oligodendroglial genes such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide. Interestingly, ethanol blocked these inhibitory effects. Tong et al. (2015a) went onto show that sub-mutagenic doses of NNK's neurotoxic effects were associated with the downregulation of the insulin/ IGF1 signalling pathway and increased oxidative damage although not to the same degree as seen with ethanol alone. Our study was a novel exploration of the combined effects of smoking and chronic alcohol consumption on WM ultrastructure in rats. The control group can be directly compared to previous TEM studies in rats that have looked at the effects of ageing (Li et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009) , malnutrition (Olivares et al., 2012) and alcohol/ thiamine deficiency (He et al., 2006) . Yang et al. (2009) reported that myelinated fibre diameter in cortical WM increased with age and that the youngest female Long Evans rats (6 months) had a mean diameter of 0.56 μm, the same figure observed here. In contrast, Olivares et al. (2012) quantified myelinated fibres in the corpus callosum of 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats and found a mean diameter of 0.49 μm. In terms of myelin sheath thickness the current mean (0.12 μm in controls) is consistent with the mean thickness in two previous studies of 0.13 μm (He et al., 2006) and 0.12 μm (Li et al., 2008) . In particular He et al. (2007) looked at the interaction between alcohol and thiamine deficiency on myelin fibres in the corpus callosum of 18-months male Wistar alcohol-preferring rats. They found that the alcohol/thiamine deficient (pyrithamine) group had smaller fibres, lower myelinated fibre diameter, thinner myelin sheaths but greater myelinated fibre density. There were interactions between alcohol and thiamine deficiency but the latter was largely responsible for WM damage seen. He et al. suggested that a selective loss or shrinkage of large fibres was responsible for the increase in myelinated fibre density. The more subtle alcohol effects reported by He et al. may reflect the chronic, intermittent exposure over 12 months, the strain and the age of the rats. Interestingly, a previous TEM study in human postmortem tissue of chronic alcoholics also failed to show a difference in WM volume or myelinated fibre diameter (Tang et al., 2004) . However, Tang et al. did note a non-significant reduction (9%) subcortical WM in alcoholics, similar to the 11% reduction in total WM seen in a previous volumetric study by their group (Jensen and Pakkenberg, 1993) and the 12% reduction in total WM reported recently by our group (McCorkindale et al., 2016) . This study provides evidence that NNK and ethanol have a synergistic relationship that results in WM degeneration. NNK and ethanol had similar effects on most of the indices measured suggesting that their pathomechanisms overlap to some degree but NNK had a greater effect on myelin integrity while ethanol had additional axonal effects. Further work is required to determine whether these findings can be extrapolated to ultrastructural studies of postmortem tissue from smoking and non-smoking alcoholics.",

         "Sequelae of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Interest of Rehabilitation",
         "CASE PRESENTATION: This clinical case presents the history of a woman hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A 62-year-old woman, with regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking, was hospitalized for moderate ARDS with bilateral pneumonitis. Fourteen days later, she was discharged from the intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. One month later, she experienced exertional dyspnea. A regression of alveolar condensation with persistent sequelae at the pulmonary bases was noted. Three months later, the patient continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. A reduction in alveolar-capillary transfer, inappropriate hyperventilation upon exercise, and impairment of gas exchanges at maximal effort, suggestive of pulmonary shunt, were demonstrated. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed exertional dyspnea with residual bilateral basal consolidations. Six months later, the dyspnea had ceased. The persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations was noted, as well as a stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be proposed to ARDS survivors. Moreover, pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise is advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation and then regular physical activity.",

         "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts for 10.4% of intensive care admissions and is associated with high mortality, between 34.9 and 46.1% depending on the severity [1] . ARDS is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by (i) new or worsening symptoms during 1 week, (ii) bilateral opacities (not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules), (iii) the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen less than 300 mm Hg with positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H 2 O or more, and (iv) no clinical evidence of heart failure or fluid overload [2] . It causes physiological alterations: alteration of pulmonary thoracic compliance, intra-lung shunt, and alveolar derecruitment responsible for severe hypoxemia, which can be generated or aggravated by invasive mechanical ventilation [3] . The causes of ARDS can be respiratory (infectious or inhalation pneumonitis) or extra respiratory (acute pancreatitis). In addition to etiological treatment, the implementation of a specific ventilation system with a low tidal volume (called protective) is essential for the management of ARDS [4] . The main complication is the progression to chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Long-term sequelae are frequently observed in survivors, with physical and/or psychological impairments and altered higher functions that directly reduce the quality of life [5] . In addition, the impaired lung function may decrease exercise tolerance [6, 7] . Although the sequelae may diminish over time, they rarely disappear, even after 5 years [7] . Monitoring of lung function after ARDS is currently not systematic, and sequelae are therefore often detected somewhat late. Yet early assessment of impaired lung function, especially at exercise, would help to optimize management by preventing or limiting the severity of complications and ultimately reducing health costs. A 62-year-old woman (body mass: 61.2 kg; height: 1.57 m; body mass index (BMI): 24.8 kg.m −2 ) was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for ARDS of infectious origin. Her medical history included autoimmune hypothyroidism, arterial hypertension, and anosmia. She reported no history of smoking. She was retired and practiced regular physical activity: walking, hiking, and using a home stepper. She was only treated by levothyroxine. The patient was first seen as an outpatient with influenzalike symptoms and was treated with probabilistic antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin then ceftriaxone) for 7 days. The evolution was unfavorable and she was admitted to the pulmonary critical care unit on 5 April 2016 with signs of acute respiratory distress. The chest X-ray on admission showed bilateral alveolar-interstitial syndrome with bilateral lower lobe consolidations (Figure 1 ), prompting spiramycin addition to her antibiotic treatment. Following a rapid deterioration in lung function under high-flow oxygen therapy, the patient was intubated (D+1) and transferred to the intensive care unit. The worsening clinical picture prompted antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) in addition to ceftriaxone (2 g) and spiramycin (1.5 million units daily). Repeated samples were taken for bacteriological (i.e., protected brush sampling of mucus plugs, cytobacteriological examination of urine, blood culture, polymerase chain reaction, and antigenuria) and virological (e.g., polymerase chain reaction for influenza) investigations. The patient was treated with norepinephrine up to 0.5 microgramme.kg −1 .min −1 for 24 hours because of hemodynamic instability. Moderate ARDS (partial pressure arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio = 123 mmHg with positive endexpiratory pressure ≥ 5 cm H 2 O) with bilateral pneumonitis was diagnosed. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation at 6 mL.kg −1 predicted body weight, along with sedation using midazolam and sufentanil and curarization with cisatracurium for 48 hours. The favorable response led to a gradual decrease in sedation and ventilatory weaning at D+10. However, following respiratory distress secondary to laryngeal edema, the patient was reintubated, and systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg.kg −1 ) was initiated. In the absence of bacteriological evidence and given the favorable clinical course, antibiotic therapy was reduced to ceftriaxone alone for 10 days. The definitive extubation (D+13) proceeded without complication. The patient (body mass: 62.0 kg, i.e., BMI: 25.2 kg.m −2 ) was discharged from the intensive care unit (D+14) after weaning from oxygen. This delay is according to the literature, which recommends between 2 and 3 weeks [8] . She then received respiratory physical therapy in the aftercare and rehabilitation department. The rehabilitation program comprised physical exercises [9] . The endurance exercises were performed on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, or stepper. Initially, endurance exercises were executed in sequences of 10 minutes or less, with the goal of reaching 30 minutes per session. The intensity of endurance exercises was prescribed on the effort perception (score of 11-13 on the ratings of perceived exertion scale) [10] . In addition, muscle strengthening exercises for the upper and lower limbs were proposed, lasting 10-15 minutes per session and using weights, dumbbells, or elastic bands. Each exercise comprised a series of 6-12 repeated movements. A 1-minute recovery period was observed between exercises. Warmup and stretching exercises were performed, respectively, before and after each session [10] . Moreover, the patient was encouraged to increase the time spent in daily living activities. One month after this episode, she experienced dyspnea on exertion with whitish sputum and a 2-kg weight gain despite daily physical activity (30 minutes/day on a stepper). At D+39, a new chest X-ray showed the clear regression of alveolar condensation with some persistent sequelae at both pulmonary bases (Figure 2) . Three months later, the patient (body mass: 63.0 kg, i.e., BMI: 25.6 kg.m −2 ) was seen in consultation in the pulmonary department. She had continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance (30 minutes/day of treadmill walking and 15 minutes/day cycling at moderate intensity). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) revealed impaired alveolarcapillary transfer with a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity reduced to 3.93 mmol/(min * kPa) (60% of the theoretical value). The pulmonary volumes and expiratory flow rates were normal (forced expiratory volume second = 1.84 L, vital capacity = 2.2 L, total lung capacity = 4.49 L; i.e., 102%, 98%, and 109% of the respective theoretical values), with no sign of obstruction (Tiffeneau ratio: 87.1%). Respiratory muscle strength was normal (based on maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and the sniff test). The patient covered a satisfactory distance of 542 m (i.e., 109% of the theoretical value) [11] in the 6-minute walk test, with significant desaturation (i.e., 8% drop in saturation, with 88% saturation at the end of the test). The cardiopulmonary exercise test indicated normal aerobic fitness with a peak oxygen flow (VO 2peak ) of 20.4 mL.min −1 .kg −1 . The exercise intolerance appeared to be ventilatory in nature with low ventilatory reserve (RV = 6.3%), high respiratory quotient (RQ = 1.32), inappropriate hyperventilation (69 L.min −1 ) with high respiratory equivalents, significant desaturation on exertion, and a high alveolar-arterial gradient (8.1 kPa), consistent with ARDS sequelae. The exercise limitation also appeared to be of metabolic origin, related to overweight. She was advised to continue regular physical activity (at the first ventilatory threshold) at home, where she had a treadmill and an ergocycle. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed only mild exertional dyspnea, stage 1 of the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) classification, but her physical activity was limited by pain from a sternal fracture caused by a road accident (August 2016). The chest CT scan confirmed residual bilateral basal consolidations. At one year, the patient no longer experienced dyspnea. The chest CT scan showed the persistence of a bilateral interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations (Figure 3 ). PFT had remained stable (carbon monoxide diffusing capacity: 63%) and no other abnormality could be detected. ARDS is an acute edema of the lungs with a high mortality rate. For this reason, it usually requires admission to an intensive care unit. The progression of histological lesions has been described as resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. During the acute exudative phase, an inflammatory process in the pulmonary alveoli causes the diffuse alveolar damage and generates disturbances in the alveolar-capillary permeability. During the fibroproliferative phase (between D+7 and D+14), a large amount of collagen is secreted by type II pneumocytes, causing remodeling of the interstitium and the alveolar spaces. The chronic phase is characterized by either pulmonary repair or the progression to fibrosis. It should be noted that these phases overlap [12] , and the specificity of the syndrome is the loss of a compartmentalized inflammation response with the perpetuation of pulmonary aggression even when the initiating phenomenon has been controlled. The respiratory sequelae in ARDS are related to alveolarcapillary membrane impairment with diminished exercise capacity, which affects patient independence and quality of life, especially in the year following diagnosis [13] . These sequelae diminish over time but do not disappear, even over the long term. Herridge et al. [7] followed patients hospitalized for ARDS for 5 years. At each consultation (3 in the first year and once a year thereafter), the patients were clinically examined, underwent a chest X-ray, PFT, a 6-minute walk test, and exercise oximetry, and responded to a quality of life questionnaire. The results indicated significantly low exercise tolerance with little distance covered during the walking test, reduced vital capacity, diffusion limitation in alveolarcapillary transfer capacity, and low quality of life scores. The physical and psychological sequelae persisted at 5 years, with a significant impact on the health-related quality of life. Usually, this long-term substantial reduction in healthrelated quality of life in surviving ARDS does not differ from findings in patients surviving other critical illness [14] . In addition to these adverse consequences for the patient, ARDS represents a significant public health cost and early management strategies are thus needed. Moreover, it has been reported that a stay in the intensive care unit has functional consequences for ARDS patients, notably muscle weakness [15] . The literature therefore recommends early exercise rehabilitation, and we encouraged our patient to return to her regular physical activity [16] . Indeed, thanks to exercise rehabilitation and then physical exercises at home, the patient no longer experienced dyspnea, and she indicated to have an acceptable quality of life and to be able to execute the activities of daily living. Thus, cardiopulmonary exercise test has not been repeated. However, it would have been interesting to accurately evaluate exercise tolerance from field tests. Field tests are low-cost, require little equipment, and are considered to be more reflective of daily living than cardiopulmonary exercise test [9] . In numerous respiratory diseases [9] and especially in ARDS [17] , the most established is the 6minute walk test. Nevertheless, it must be performed in an unobstructed 30-metre hallway [18] , and such a space is rarely available in the patient's home, in the physician's office, or even in some respiratory medicine departments. Thus, to overcome this spatial limitation, a 6-minute stepper test has recently been proposed [19] . This exercise test requires only a limited amount of space and equipment and is feasible, valid, reproducible, and sensitive in patients with respiratory diseases [19, 20] . Consequently, this field exercise test might be recommended to evaluate tolerance exercise in ARDS survivors, when cardiopulmonary exercise test or 6-minute walk test is unavailable. Nevertheless, further studies are needed. The respiratory sequelae of ARDS had a significant clinical impact on our patient, especially during exercise. These sequelae were confirmed by the pulmonary evaluations at 3, 6, and 12 months. Moreover, overweight might have had an impact on the clinical response to exercise. Finally, the pain from a sternal fracture at the 6 months has limited patient's physical activity, and thus it is possible that, without the road accident, the benefits would have been better. As was the case for our patient and in the studies cited, post-intensive care management should be systematic for ARDS survivors, with early pulmonary evaluation at exercise (3 months) and, when possible, functional and respiratory rehabilitation to improve the respiratory function prognosis. Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be systematically proposed to ARDS survivors. In addition, a control chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise are advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to prevent or limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation, which should then be followed by regular physical activity. In this way, short-, medium-, and long-term prognosis are improved, as well as quality of life. All the authors disclose that they do not have any conflicts of interest.",
         "Sequelae of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Interest of Rehabilitation. CASE PRESENTATION: This clinical case presents the history of a woman hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A 62-year-old woman, with regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking, was hospitalized for moderate ARDS with bilateral pneumonitis. Fourteen days later, she was discharged from the intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. One month later, she experienced exertional dyspnea. A regression of alveolar condensation with persistent sequelae at the pulmonary bases was noted. Three months later, the patient continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. A reduction in alveolar-capillary transfer, inappropriate hyperventilation upon exercise, and impairment of gas exchanges at maximal effort, suggestive of pulmonary shunt, were demonstrated. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed exertional dyspnea with residual bilateral basal consolidations. Six months later, the dyspnea had ceased. The persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations was noted, as well as a stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be proposed to ARDS survivors. Moreover, pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise is advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation and then regular physical activity.. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts for 10.4% of intensive care admissions and is associated with high mortality, between 34.9 and 46.1% depending on the severity [1] . ARDS is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by (i) new or worsening symptoms during 1 week, (ii) bilateral opacities (not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules), (iii) the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen less than 300 mm Hg with positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H 2 O or more, and (iv) no clinical evidence of heart failure or fluid overload [2] . It causes physiological alterations: alteration of pulmonary thoracic compliance, intra-lung shunt, and alveolar derecruitment responsible for severe hypoxemia, which can be generated or aggravated by invasive mechanical ventilation [3] . The causes of ARDS can be respiratory (infectious or inhalation pneumonitis) or extra respiratory (acute pancreatitis). In addition to etiological treatment, the implementation of a specific ventilation system with a low tidal volume (called protective) is essential for the management of ARDS [4] . The main complication is the progression to chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Long-term sequelae are frequently observed in survivors, with physical and/or psychological impairments and altered higher functions that directly reduce the quality of life [5] . In addition, the impaired lung function may decrease exercise tolerance [6, 7] . Although the sequelae may diminish over time, they rarely disappear, even after 5 years [7] . Monitoring of lung function after ARDS is currently not systematic, and sequelae are therefore often detected somewhat late. Yet early assessment of impaired lung function, especially at exercise, would help to optimize management by preventing or limiting the severity of complications and ultimately reducing health costs. A 62-year-old woman (body mass: 61.2 kg; height: 1.57 m; body mass index (BMI): 24.8 kg.m −2 ) was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for ARDS of infectious origin. Her medical history included autoimmune hypothyroidism, arterial hypertension, and anosmia. She reported no history of smoking. She was retired and practiced regular physical activity: walking, hiking, and using a home stepper. She was only treated by levothyroxine. The patient was first seen as an outpatient with influenzalike symptoms and was treated with probabilistic antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin then ceftriaxone) for 7 days. The evolution was unfavorable and she was admitted to the pulmonary critical care unit on 5 April 2016 with signs of acute respiratory distress. The chest X-ray on admission showed bilateral alveolar-interstitial syndrome with bilateral lower lobe consolidations (Figure 1 ), prompting spiramycin addition to her antibiotic treatment. Following a rapid deterioration in lung function under high-flow oxygen therapy, the patient was intubated (D+1) and transferred to the intensive care unit. The worsening clinical picture prompted antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) in addition to ceftriaxone (2 g) and spiramycin (1.5 million units daily). Repeated samples were taken for bacteriological (i.e., protected brush sampling of mucus plugs, cytobacteriological examination of urine, blood culture, polymerase chain reaction, and antigenuria) and virological (e.g., polymerase chain reaction for influenza) investigations. The patient was treated with norepinephrine up to 0.5 microgramme.kg −1 .min −1 for 24 hours because of hemodynamic instability. Moderate ARDS (partial pressure arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio = 123 mmHg with positive endexpiratory pressure ≥ 5 cm H 2 O) with bilateral pneumonitis was diagnosed. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation at 6 mL.kg −1 predicted body weight, along with sedation using midazolam and sufentanil and curarization with cisatracurium for 48 hours. The favorable response led to a gradual decrease in sedation and ventilatory weaning at D+10. However, following respiratory distress secondary to laryngeal edema, the patient was reintubated, and systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg.kg −1 ) was initiated. In the absence of bacteriological evidence and given the favorable clinical course, antibiotic therapy was reduced to ceftriaxone alone for 10 days. The definitive extubation (D+13) proceeded without complication. The patient (body mass: 62.0 kg, i.e., BMI: 25.2 kg.m −2 ) was discharged from the intensive care unit (D+14) after weaning from oxygen. This delay is according to the literature, which recommends between 2 and 3 weeks [8] . She then received respiratory physical therapy in the aftercare and rehabilitation department. The rehabilitation program comprised physical exercises [9] . The endurance exercises were performed on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, or stepper. Initially, endurance exercises were executed in sequences of 10 minutes or less, with the goal of reaching 30 minutes per session. The intensity of endurance exercises was prescribed on the effort perception (score of 11-13 on the ratings of perceived exertion scale) [10] . In addition, muscle strengthening exercises for the upper and lower limbs were proposed, lasting 10-15 minutes per session and using weights, dumbbells, or elastic bands. Each exercise comprised a series of 6-12 repeated movements. A 1-minute recovery period was observed between exercises. Warmup and stretching exercises were performed, respectively, before and after each session [10] . Moreover, the patient was encouraged to increase the time spent in daily living activities. One month after this episode, she experienced dyspnea on exertion with whitish sputum and a 2-kg weight gain despite daily physical activity (30 minutes/day on a stepper). At D+39, a new chest X-ray showed the clear regression of alveolar condensation with some persistent sequelae at both pulmonary bases (Figure 2) . Three months later, the patient (body mass: 63.0 kg, i.e., BMI: 25.6 kg.m −2 ) was seen in consultation in the pulmonary department. She had continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance (30 minutes/day of treadmill walking and 15 minutes/day cycling at moderate intensity). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) revealed impaired alveolarcapillary transfer with a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity reduced to 3.93 mmol/(min * kPa) (60% of the theoretical value). The pulmonary volumes and expiratory flow rates were normal (forced expiratory volume second = 1.84 L, vital capacity = 2.2 L, total lung capacity = 4.49 L; i.e., 102%, 98%, and 109% of the respective theoretical values), with no sign of obstruction (Tiffeneau ratio: 87.1%). Respiratory muscle strength was normal (based on maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and the sniff test). The patient covered a satisfactory distance of 542 m (i.e., 109% of the theoretical value) [11] in the 6-minute walk test, with significant desaturation (i.e., 8% drop in saturation, with 88% saturation at the end of the test). The cardiopulmonary exercise test indicated normal aerobic fitness with a peak oxygen flow (VO 2peak ) of 20.4 mL.min −1 .kg −1 . The exercise intolerance appeared to be ventilatory in nature with low ventilatory reserve (RV = 6.3%), high respiratory quotient (RQ = 1.32), inappropriate hyperventilation (69 L.min −1 ) with high respiratory equivalents, significant desaturation on exertion, and a high alveolar-arterial gradient (8.1 kPa), consistent with ARDS sequelae. The exercise limitation also appeared to be of metabolic origin, related to overweight. She was advised to continue regular physical activity (at the first ventilatory threshold) at home, where she had a treadmill and an ergocycle. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed only mild exertional dyspnea, stage 1 of the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) classification, but her physical activity was limited by pain from a sternal fracture caused by a road accident (August 2016). The chest CT scan confirmed residual bilateral basal consolidations. At one year, the patient no longer experienced dyspnea. The chest CT scan showed the persistence of a bilateral interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations (Figure 3 ). PFT had remained stable (carbon monoxide diffusing capacity: 63%) and no other abnormality could be detected. ARDS is an acute edema of the lungs with a high mortality rate. For this reason, it usually requires admission to an intensive care unit. The progression of histological lesions has been described as resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. During the acute exudative phase, an inflammatory process in the pulmonary alveoli causes the diffuse alveolar damage and generates disturbances in the alveolar-capillary permeability. During the fibroproliferative phase (between D+7 and D+14), a large amount of collagen is secreted by type II pneumocytes, causing remodeling of the interstitium and the alveolar spaces. The chronic phase is characterized by either pulmonary repair or the progression to fibrosis. It should be noted that these phases overlap [12] , and the specificity of the syndrome is the loss of a compartmentalized inflammation response with the perpetuation of pulmonary aggression even when the initiating phenomenon has been controlled. The respiratory sequelae in ARDS are related to alveolarcapillary membrane impairment with diminished exercise capacity, which affects patient independence and quality of life, especially in the year following diagnosis [13] . These sequelae diminish over time but do not disappear, even over the long term. Herridge et al. [7] followed patients hospitalized for ARDS for 5 years. At each consultation (3 in the first year and once a year thereafter), the patients were clinically examined, underwent a chest X-ray, PFT, a 6-minute walk test, and exercise oximetry, and responded to a quality of life questionnaire. The results indicated significantly low exercise tolerance with little distance covered during the walking test, reduced vital capacity, diffusion limitation in alveolarcapillary transfer capacity, and low quality of life scores. The physical and psychological sequelae persisted at 5 years, with a significant impact on the health-related quality of life. Usually, this long-term substantial reduction in healthrelated quality of life in surviving ARDS does not differ from findings in patients surviving other critical illness [14] . In addition to these adverse consequences for the patient, ARDS represents a significant public health cost and early management strategies are thus needed. Moreover, it has been reported that a stay in the intensive care unit has functional consequences for ARDS patients, notably muscle weakness [15] . The literature therefore recommends early exercise rehabilitation, and we encouraged our patient to return to her regular physical activity [16] . Indeed, thanks to exercise rehabilitation and then physical exercises at home, the patient no longer experienced dyspnea, and she indicated to have an acceptable quality of life and to be able to execute the activities of daily living. Thus, cardiopulmonary exercise test has not been repeated. However, it would have been interesting to accurately evaluate exercise tolerance from field tests. Field tests are low-cost, require little equipment, and are considered to be more reflective of daily living than cardiopulmonary exercise test [9] . In numerous respiratory diseases [9] and especially in ARDS [17] , the most established is the 6minute walk test. Nevertheless, it must be performed in an unobstructed 30-metre hallway [18] , and such a space is rarely available in the patient's home, in the physician's office, or even in some respiratory medicine departments. Thus, to overcome this spatial limitation, a 6-minute stepper test has recently been proposed [19] . This exercise test requires only a limited amount of space and equipment and is feasible, valid, reproducible, and sensitive in patients with respiratory diseases [19, 20] . Consequently, this field exercise test might be recommended to evaluate tolerance exercise in ARDS survivors, when cardiopulmonary exercise test or 6-minute walk test is unavailable. Nevertheless, further studies are needed. The respiratory sequelae of ARDS had a significant clinical impact on our patient, especially during exercise. These sequelae were confirmed by the pulmonary evaluations at 3, 6, and 12 months. Moreover, overweight might have had an impact on the clinical response to exercise. Finally, the pain from a sternal fracture at the 6 months has limited patient's physical activity, and thus it is possible that, without the road accident, the benefits would have been better. As was the case for our patient and in the studies cited, post-intensive care management should be systematic for ARDS survivors, with early pulmonary evaluation at exercise (3 months) and, when possible, functional and respiratory rehabilitation to improve the respiratory function prognosis. Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be systematically proposed to ARDS survivors. In addition, a control chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise are advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to prevent or limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation, which should then be followed by regular physical activity. In this way, short-, medium-, and long-term prognosis are improved, as well as quality of life. All the authors disclose that they do not have any conflicts of interest.",

         "Severe odontogenic infections with septic progress – a constant and increasing challenge: a retrospective analysis",
         "BACKGROUND: More than 90% of all infections in the head and neck region can be traced back to an odontogenic origin. In rare cases they can lead to sepsis, which may pose a vital threat to the patient. The purpose of this study was to analyse characteristics concerning etiology and progress of severe odontogenic infections with a fulminant development. METHODS: All patients with odontogenic infections requiring hospital admission were included in a retrospective analysis conducted from 02/2012 to 09/2017. Of 483 patients 16 patients (13 male, 3 female) showed severe exacerbation with septic progress. The average age was 52.8 years. All patients underwent at least one surgical procedure that involved an extraoral incision and drainage as well as high volume irrigation intraoperatively. At least one revision was required for four of the patients. Three patients showed an exceedingly severe disease progression with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the results of an antibiogram and resistogram. Irrigation with saline was done several times a day. RESULTS: Sixteen patients showed odontogenic infections that spread over multiple maxillo-facial and cervical regions accompanied by septic laboratory signs. All these patients needed intensive care and a tracheostomy. The hospitalization period was 27.8 days on average. In 16 cases risk factors for the development of odontogenic abscesses like diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism and poor oral hygiene were present. Intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria, especially anaerobes and streptococci, mainly Streptocococcus viridans. CONCLUSION: Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated based on clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision and drainage including elimination of odontogenic foci as well as intensified intra- and postoperative irrigation. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance. A combination of tazobactam and piperacillin has proven to be a good first choice and can be recommended for abscesses that spread over multiple levels with initial signs of severe infections.",

         "The majority of head and neck infections are odontogenic [17] . Odontogenic infections can spread and cause severe complications, e.g. compromised airways, sepsis, tissue necrosis, endocarditis, mediastinitis and deep neck infections [3] . These severe odontogenic infections can be potentially life-threatening [14, 17] . There are several predisposing factors which may exacerbate odontogenic infections, such as immunodeficiency (human immunodeficiency virus HIV), long-term diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol abuse, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, immunosuppression after organ transplantation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and systemic lupus erythematosus [4, 9, 11, 12, 16] . Usually odontogenic infections respond well to a combination of surgical sanitation, incision, drainage and antibiotic therapy [5, 14] . Odontogenic infections exhibit a variety of different pathogens: Streptococci, especially Streptococcus viridans, a representative of gram-positive aerobic bacteria and Prevotella species, a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria are common pathogens in odontogenic infections [1, 8, 15] . The purpose of this study was to analyse etiology and sequence of especially severe manifestations of odontogenic abscesses. This retrospective study included all 483 patients with odontogenic infections, who were hospitalized from February 2012 to September 2017 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany. This time period was chosen because we found an increase of septic occurrences of odontogenic infections between these dates. The treatment for all patients included incision, drainage and surgical sanitation of the odontogenic focus plus antibiotic treatment. Intraoperative swabs were taken to adjust antibiotic treatment following performance of an antibiogram and a resistogram. Within this population, 16 patients (13 male, three female) with an average age of  All 16 patients suffered from pre-existing conditions, some of which may have contributed as predisposing factors to odontogenic abscesses and a systemic inflammatory reaction. These include, for example, diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism, cardiological and neuro-psychiatric disorders and poor oral hygiene. A decayed mandibular molar or premolar was the infectious focus in all 16 patients (Table 1) . All patients showed swelling of affected areas, trismus, dysphagia, dyspnea, involvement of several fascial spaces, phlegmonous spread, laboratory parameters of septicemia and a C-reactive protein (CRP) above 200 mg/l with white blood cell counts greater than 19*1000/ μl at admittance. Preoperatively white blood cell count averaged 22.0 ± 10.6*1000 cells/μl and CRP 251 ± 1.0 mg/ml. The preoperative CT scan of the head and neck region in nine patients provided an exact overview of the extent of infection and the affected fascial spaces. An antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin 600 mg 1-0-1 had been administered to three patients before hospital admission and surgical sanitation of the odontogenous focus had been performed. All Patients underwent extraoral incision, drainage of affected areas and elimination of odontogenic foci under general anaesthesia. On average, the maximum number of drainage tubes inserted was 9.1 ± standard deviation. A second look surgery was required in four patients. Ultimately, two patients required four surgical operations and another two cases required six operations. Nine patients received an initial, carefully calculated, intravenous antibiotic therapy of cefuroxim 1.5 g 3x /d and likewise seven patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g 3x/d immediately after hospital admission. Intraoperative swabs were taken by inserting the swab into the abscess space. These swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria. Streptococcus viridans was the predominant bacterium (75%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (38%), Enterococcus faecalis (31%) and Prevotella oris (31%) ( Table 2 ). All antibiograms and resistograms included the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ceferoxime, clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin, piperacillin and tazobactam. Clindamycin had an increased mechanism of resistance to all groups of microrganisms whereas tazobactam and piperacillin showed susceptibility to all isolated bacteria (Table 3) . In all 16 patients, postoperative intensive medical care was required. The average length of postoperative medical care was 20.3 days (ranging from 8 to 33 days). All patients needed a temporary tracheostomy to secure airway management. The mean postoperative artificial respiration time was 15.6 days (ranging from 6 to 27 days). The average length of inpatient stay was 27.8 days (ranging from 11 to 40 days). Five patients had multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. The abscess cavity was irrigated multiple times a day (mean 2.3/die) with 100 ml or more saline 0.9% (Fig. 1) . Based on the swab results, antibiotic treatment was adjusted to the antibiogram in all cases. After an average of 2.3 days, antibiotic treatment with tazobactam and piperacillin was started for all patients showing signs of a septic course. The mean time for the CRP parameter to decrease was during the third inpatient day (Fig. 2) . Generally, the white blood cell count dropped on the first postoperative day (Fig. 3 ). Odontogenic abscesses with fulminant progression that lead to severe, sometimes life-threatening complications like sepsis, airway obstruction, fasciitis, tissue necrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombosis, mediastinitis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are rare, but require extensive interdisciplinary collaboration especially with specialists for anesthesiology and intensive care medicine. Some predisposing factors or co-morbidities, e.g. diabetes mellitus, obesity, poor oral hygiene, and long-term nicotine or alcohol abuse may aggravate such septic progressions. These cases show greatly increased inpatient stays combined with a worse prognosis compared to patients who do not exhibit the named factors [7, 12, 13] . Sixteen out of 483 patients (3.3%) with odontogenic infections showed a septic course during the observation period of 5.5 years. All 16 patients displayed at least one risk factor or co-morbidity, which may have promoted the critical course of their infection with extended hospitalisation and intensive care. In all 16 cases of severe odontogenic abscesses we observed a premolar or molar mandibular focus and identified a need for postoperative respiratory assistance or tracheostomy. This is in accordance with recent literature [10, 17] . We recommend a Fig. 1 a-b Postoperative CT series in planar depiction after drainage with drains at lingual and buccal sides of the mandible. c CT 3D reconstruction after drainage with 9 tubes All areas with imaging correlated signs preoperative CT-scan with contrast agent in cases with septic laboratory signs to obtain an exact overview of the extent of the abscess space. If the expected alleviation after initial surgical treatment with incision, drainage and perioperative antibiotic therapy is delayed, an immediate re-CT examination and targeted re-incision should be initiated without hesitation [6] . In our findings clindamycin demonstrated a reduced susceptibility in all groups of isolated pathogens. Tazobactam and piperacillin showed no resistance to any of the bacteria isolated. Surgical intervention included incision, drainage, sanitation of the odontogenic focus and antibiotic treatment as first-line therapy [5] . Current literature is controversial on whether irrigative or non-irrigative drainage tubes are superior [2] . From our experience, we prefer high-volume irrigation of the abscess cavity with isotonic saline solution (0.9%) in cases with septic progression. Our findings support this approach. The isolated pathogens of intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria: Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant pathogens [1] . The initial calculated antibiotic therapy should focus on these pathogens to inhibit the risk of infection spreading and lower the risk of possible serious complications. Initiating a pathogen adapted antibiotic treatment as soon as possible with tazobactam and piperacillin in combination as first line medication is preferred. Patients that show CRP values above 200 mg/l and white blood cell counts greater than 19*1000/μl on admission require special attention. Our patients showed a noticeable decrease in their inflammation parameters during the second day after use of tazobactam and piperacillin. Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated according to clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision, intensification of intraand postoperative irrigation, and drainage to eliminate odontogenic foci. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance.

         "Severe odontogenic infections with septic progress – a constant and increasing challenge: a retrospective analysis. BACKGROUND: More than 90% of all infections in the head and neck region can be traced back to an odontogenic origin. In rare cases they can lead to sepsis, which may pose a vital threat to the patient. The purpose of this study was to analyse characteristics concerning etiology and progress of severe odontogenic infections with a fulminant development. METHODS: All patients with odontogenic infections requiring hospital admission were included in a retrospective analysis conducted from 02/2012 to 09/2017. Of 483 patients 16 patients (13 male, 3 female) showed severe exacerbation with septic progress. The average age was 52.8 years. All patients underwent at least one surgical procedure that involved an extraoral incision and drainage as well as high volume irrigation intraoperatively. At least one revision was required for four of the patients. Three patients showed an exceedingly severe disease progression with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the results of an antibiogram and resistogram. Irrigation with saline was done several times a day. RESULTS: Sixteen patients showed odontogenic infections that spread over multiple maxillo-facial and cervical regions accompanied by septic laboratory signs. All these patients needed intensive care and a tracheostomy. The hospitalization period was 27.8 days on average. In 16 cases risk factors for the development of odontogenic abscesses like diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism and poor oral hygiene were present. Intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria, especially anaerobes and streptococci, mainly Streptocococcus viridans. CONCLUSION: Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated based on clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision and drainage including elimination of odontogenic foci as well as intensified intra- and postoperative irrigation. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance. A combination of tazobactam and piperacillin has proven to be a good first choice and can be recommended for abscesses that spread over multiple levels with initial signs of severe infections.. The majority of head and neck infections are odontogenic [17] . Odontogenic infections can spread and cause severe complications, e.g. compromised airways, sepsis, tissue necrosis, endocarditis, mediastinitis and deep neck infections [3] . These severe odontogenic infections can be potentially life-threatening [14, 17] . There are several predisposing factors which may exacerbate odontogenic infections, such as immunodeficiency (human immunodeficiency virus HIV), long-term diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol abuse, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, immunosuppression after organ transplantation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and systemic lupus erythematosus [4, 9, 11, 12, 16] . Usually odontogenic infections respond well to a combination of surgical sanitation, incision, drainage and antibiotic therapy [5, 14] . Odontogenic infections exhibit a variety of different pathogens: Streptococci, especially Streptococcus viridans, a representative of gram-positive aerobic bacteria and Prevotella species, a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria are common pathogens in odontogenic infections [1, 8, 15] . The purpose of this study was to analyse etiology and sequence of especially severe manifestations of odontogenic abscesses. This retrospective study included all 483 patients with odontogenic infections, who were hospitalized from February 2012 to September 2017 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany. This time period was chosen because we found an increase of septic occurrences of odontogenic infections between these dates. The treatment for all patients included incision, drainage and surgical sanitation of the odontogenic focus plus antibiotic treatment. Intraoperative swabs were taken to adjust antibiotic treatment following performance of an antibiogram and a resistogram. Within this population, 16 patients (13 male, three female) with an average age of  All 16 patients suffered from pre-existing conditions, some of which may have contributed as predisposing factors to odontogenic abscesses and a systemic inflammatory reaction. These include, for example, diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism, cardiological and neuro-psychiatric disorders and poor oral hygiene. A decayed mandibular molar or premolar was the infectious focus in all 16 patients (Table 1) . All patients showed swelling of affected areas, trismus, dysphagia, dyspnea, involvement of several fascial spaces, phlegmonous spread, laboratory parameters of septicemia and a C-reactive protein (CRP) above 200 mg/l with white blood cell counts greater than 19*1000/ μl at admittance. Preoperatively white blood cell count averaged 22.0 ± 10.6*1000 cells/μl and CRP 251 ± 1.0 mg/ml. The preoperative CT scan of the head and neck region in nine patients provided an exact overview of the extent of infection and the affected fascial spaces. An antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin 600 mg 1-0-1 had been administered to three patients before hospital admission and surgical sanitation of the odontogenous focus had been performed. All Patients underwent extraoral incision, drainage of affected areas and elimination of odontogenic foci under general anaesthesia. On average, the maximum number of drainage tubes inserted was 9.1 ± standard deviation. A second look surgery was required in four patients. Ultimately, two patients required four surgical operations and another two cases required six operations. Nine patients received an initial, carefully calculated, intravenous antibiotic therapy of cefuroxim 1.5 g 3x /d and likewise seven patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g 3x/d immediately after hospital admission. Intraoperative swabs were taken by inserting the swab into the abscess space. These swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria. Streptococcus viridans was the predominant bacterium (75%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (38%), Enterococcus faecalis (31%) and Prevotella oris (31%) ( Table 2 ). All antibiograms and resistograms included the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ceferoxime, clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin, piperacillin and tazobactam. Clindamycin had an increased mechanism of resistance to all groups of microrganisms whereas tazobactam and piperacillin showed susceptibility to all isolated bacteria (Table 3) . In all 16 patients, postoperative intensive medical care was required. The average length of postoperative medical care was 20.3 days (ranging from 8 to 33 days). All patients needed a temporary tracheostomy to secure airway management. The mean postoperative artificial respiration time was 15.6 days (ranging from 6 to 27 days). The average length of inpatient stay was 27.8 days (ranging from 11 to 40 days). Five patients had multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. The abscess cavity was irrigated multiple times a day (mean 2.3/die) with 100 ml or more saline 0.9% (Fig. 1) . Based on the swab results, antibiotic treatment was adjusted to the antibiogram in all cases. After an average of 2.3 days, antibiotic treatment with tazobactam and piperacillin was started for all patients showing signs of a septic course. The mean time for the CRP parameter to decrease was during the third inpatient day (Fig. 2) . Generally, the white blood cell count dropped on the first postoperative day (Fig. 3 ). Odontogenic abscesses with fulminant progression that lead to severe, sometimes life-threatening complications like sepsis, airway obstruction, fasciitis, tissue necrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombosis, mediastinitis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are rare, but require extensive interdisciplinary collaboration especially with specialists for anesthesiology and intensive care medicine. Some predisposing factors or co-morbidities, e.g. diabetes mellitus, obesity, poor oral hygiene, and long-term nicotine or alcohol abuse may aggravate such septic progressions. These cases show greatly increased inpatient stays combined with a worse prognosis compared to patients who do not exhibit the named factors [7, 12, 13] . Sixteen out of 483 patients (3.3%) with odontogenic infections showed a septic course during the observation period of 5.5 years. All 16 patients displayed at least one risk factor or co-morbidity, which may have promoted the critical course of their infection with extended hospitalisation and intensive care. In all 16 cases of severe odontogenic abscesses we observed a premolar or molar mandibular focus and identified a need for postoperative respiratory assistance or tracheostomy. This is in accordance with recent literature [10, 17] . We recommend a Fig. 1 a-b Postoperative CT series in planar depiction after drainage with drains at lingual and buccal sides of the mandible. c CT 3D reconstruction after drainage with 9 tubes All areas with imaging correlated signs preoperative CT-scan with contrast agent in cases with septic laboratory signs to obtain an exact overview of the extent of the abscess space. If the expected alleviation after initial surgical treatment with incision, drainage and perioperative antibiotic therapy is delayed, an immediate re-CT examination and targeted re-incision should be initiated without hesitation [6] . In our findings clindamycin demonstrated a reduced susceptibility in all groups of isolated pathogens. Tazobactam and piperacillin showed no resistance to any of the bacteria isolated. Surgical intervention included incision, drainage, sanitation of the odontogenic focus and antibiotic treatment as first-line therapy [5] . Current literature is controversial on whether irrigative or non-irrigative drainage tubes are superior [2] . From our experience, we prefer high-volume irrigation of the abscess cavity with isotonic saline solution (0.9%) in cases with septic progression. Our findings support this approach. The isolated pathogens of intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria: Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant pathogens [1] . The initial calculated antibiotic therapy should focus on these pathogens to inhibit the risk of infection spreading and lower the risk of possible serious complications. Initiating a pathogen adapted antibiotic treatment as soon as possible with tazobactam and piperacillin in combination as first line medication is preferred. Patients that show CRP values above 200 mg/l and white blood cell counts greater than 19*1000/μl on admission require special attention. Our patients showed a noticeable decrease in their inflammation parameters during the second day after use of tazobactam and piperacillin. Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated according to clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision, intensification of intraand postoperative irrigation, and drainage to eliminate odontogenic foci. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance.

         "Risk modifiers of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis: a retrospective analysis of the FORECAST study",
         "BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016–March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22–33)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16–28), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06–3.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06–0.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04–5.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05–1.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.",

         "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) comprises heterogenous clinical conditions. Reportedly, the prognosis of ARDS is poor [1, 2] , and once a patient develops ARDS, treatment options are limited to only a few supportive strategies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , making it important to identify patients at a high risk of ARDS [10] . Previous studies have reported a variety of causes and risk factors of ARDS [1, 11] ; however, there is a lack of clarity between these because only a small proportion of patients with these causes and risk factors develop ARDS [12, 13] . Therefore, alternative efforts have been recently focusing on the roles of two types of risk factors: predisposing conditions and risk modifiers [14, 15] . Predisposing conditions are preceding acute pathophysiological events, such as sepsis. Risk modifiers include obesity [15, 16] , smoking status [15, 17, 18] , diabetes mellitus (DM) (reduced risk modifier) [14, 15, 19] , glucocorticoids [20] , statin [21, 22] , non-pulmonary infection (reduced risk modifier) [13, 23] , shock [13, 15] , tachypnea [14, 15] , oxygen supplementation [15, 24] , hematocrit [11] , hypoalbuminemia [14, 15] , acidemia [11, 15] , and disease severity [2, 11, 13] . There is a possibility that ARDS may be precisely predicted using a combination of predisposing conditions and risk modifiers. ARDS has been associated with two major pathophysiologic changes in various proportions. One is the influx of protein-rich effusion to the alveolar space caused by the damage of the local alveolar epithelium and another is leakage to the pulmonary interstitium through the capillary endothelium caused by systemic inflammation. Direct ARDS is associated with higher impairment of alveolar epithelium and lower impairment of capillary endothelium than indirect ARDS [23, 25] . Thus, we think risk modifiers of direct and indirect ARDS should be discussed separately. Indeed to date, however, little has been reported about risk modifiers for ARDS among patients with nonpulmonary sepsis because a large proportion of patients with pulmonary sepsis have been included in previous studies about risk modifiers [2, 14, 15] . We aimed to evaluate the risk modifiers associated with indirect ARDS among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. We conducted a secondary analysis of the sepsis cohort in the Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis, and Trauma (FORECAST) study. This was a multicenter prospective cohort study of 1184 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock enrolled from 59 Intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan and conducted from January 2016 to March 2017 [26] . We included adult patients from the FORECAST database if they were aged ≥ 16 years and had severe sepsis or septic shock caused by non-pulmonary infection. The exclusion criteria were patients with missing data of the first or fourth days of ARDS screening in this study. Patient information was obtained from the FORECAST database, including demographic data, admission source, comorbidities, infection sites, sepsis-related severity scores, and laboratory data. Data collection was performed as part of the routine clinical workup by the original FORECAST investigators. ARDS was diagnosed if present on the first or fourth day of ARDS screening, according to the Berlin ARDS definition [27] . Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined based on the sepsis-2 criteria [28] . Non-pulmonary infection was defined as infection other than pneumonia or empyema. Cases of DM with and without end-organ complications were reported as comorbidities. Also, \"ventilator-free days\" was defined as the number of days within the first 28 days after enrolment, during which a patient was able to breathe without the help of a ventilator. Patients who died during the study were assigned a ventilator-free day of 0. ICU-free days were calculated and scored in a similar manner [29] . Patients were stratified into groups with and without ARDS (i.e., ARDS and No ARDS groups). Descriptive statistics were calculated as proportions for categorical variables and as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) or mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, where appropriate. Statistical differences between two groups were evaluated by univariate analyses, using the chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables because the data did not have a normal distribution. To identify the risk modifiers correlated with having ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis, we developed a multivariate logistic regression model and reported odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We hypothesized that there could be different risk modifiers for indirect ARDS compared with those for direct ARDS reported in previous studies. The primary outcome of interest was having ARDS, and the explanatory variables were selected based on previous research: body mass index, smoking status, DM, glucocorticoids, statin, site of infection, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score. We also include clinically relevant explanatory variables, such as age, gender, admission source, and coexisting conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). However, we did not take variables such as tachypnea, oxygen supplementation, acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia into the logistic regression model because these possible risk modifiers might result from ARDS. Finally, the non-pulmonary Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used in a sensitivity analysis. All p values were two-sided, with p values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the EZR software (Version 1.32) [30] . Of the 1184 patients with severe sepsis in the FORE-CAST study, 817 with non-pulmonary infection were eligible for this study. Another 85 patients were excluded because they had missing data of the first day of ARDS screening. This left a cohort of 69 patients with ARDS and 663 without ARDS on the first day of screening. Of those without ARDS, 35 died on the second or third day and 103 patients had missing data of the fourth day of ARDS screening, so were excluded. Finally, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS at the first or fourth day of ARDS screening (the ARDS group) (Fig. 1 ) The median age was 72 (IQR: 62-81) years and males accounted for 340 patients (57.2%). There were 231 patients (38.9%) with abdominal infection, 147 (24.7%) with urinary tract infection, and 91 (15.3%) with soft tissue infection. The baseline characteristics are compared between patients with and without ARDS in Table 1 . Patients with ARDS had a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index than patients without ARDS, but there were no significant differences between the groups regarding other baseline characteristics, such as age, gender, and admission source. There was no significant difference between patients with and without ARDS regarding previously known risk modifiers for direct and indirect ARDS, including body mass index, DM, smoking status, and site of infection. A higher proportion of patients had septic shock with ARDS (80%) than without ARDS (66%; p = 0.02). Compared to those without ARDS, patients with ARDS had higher severity scores assessed by the APACHE II (26 vs. 21, p < 0.001) and Non-pulmonary SOFA (9 vs. 7, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality in patients with and without ARDS was 29.9% and 16.5%, respectively (p = 0.007) ( Table 2) . Of the 404 patients with septic shock, the in-hospital mortality rate of those with ARDS was significantly higher than that of patients without ARDS (32.8% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.01). The median ventilator-free days for patients with ARDS was less than that for patients without ARDS (15 [0-21] vs. 22 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , p < 0.001), as was the median ICUfree days (14 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] vs. 19 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay by ARDS status (25 vs. 26 , p = 0.39). In terms of survivor dispositions, a larger proportion of patients with ARDS than without ARDS needed to be transferred to other facilities. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we identified three main risk modifiers associated with having ARDS (Table 3) . Notably, the odds of having ARDS were higher for patients from the emergency department than  In this retrospective cohort study of patients with nonpulmonary sepsis, admission route (from the emergency department rather than wards or other hospitals), disease severity (a higher APACHE II score), and infection site (soft tissue rather than abdominal infection) were risk modifiers for non-pulmonary septic ARDS. However, obesity, DM, statins, glucocorticoids, and shock were not statistically associated with ARDS. Duration of onset from infection could be a valid risk modifier of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis. In our results, admission from the emergency department was related to having ARDS, and it is possible that both direct and indirect ARDS developed soon after or at the onset of sepsis [15, 31] . Thus, ARDS may not have occurred after time had passed from admission, and further studies are needed to investigate the timing of the onset of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis. Site of infection also appeared to be a risk modifier for ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis. One study showed that abdominal infection was related to with ARDS [23] , and another study showed that soft tissue infection was related to without ARDS in population that included pulmonary infection [13, 32] . The correlation with indirect ARDS in most previous studies may have been attenuated because pulmonary infection is a major predisposing condition and few studies focused on non-pulmonary infection [2, 14, 15] . We showed that, when excluding this, soft tissue infection could be related to having ARDS. Not only pulmonary but also severe soft tissue infection could be a novel risk modifier. However, these patients were more likely to be admitted to wards instead of ICUs, presumably because shock was less common [33] . By limiting our cohort to ICUs, we may have introduced some bias. It is possible that our data for site of infection reflect only disease severity, despite controlling for severity using the APACHE II score and shock status. Pathogens beyond the site of infection may also be related to having ARDS, but our sensitivity analysis did not show a difference (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Further studies are needed to confirm which infection site is more related to developing ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. We confirmed that the severity of non-pulmonary sepsis (APACHE II score) was related to having ARDS, consistent with the results in previous studies [2, 11, 13] . In this study, we did not exclude the possibility of the pulmonary parameter of the APACHE II score representing pre-existing ARDS in the emergency department. Thus, we performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the APACHE II score with the non-pulmonary SOFA score, and it showed similar results to the main analysis (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). However, having shock was not related to having ARDS in our population, indicating that having ARDS in nonpulmonary sepsis might be associated with the development of multiple organ failure instead of circulatory failure (shock) [2, 31] . Further studies are needed to determine organ failures that are more likely to occur with ARDS. We did not show roles for obesity, DM, statins, and glucocorticoids which have been shown to be risk modifiers for ARDS in previous studies. Although they were risk modifiers in direct and indirect ARDS combined, the tendencies of the ORs were similar. Otherwise, obesity may not be a risk modifier of ARDS due to nonpulmonary sepsis because of mechanism is not the same [23, 25] . DM, statin use, and glucocorticoid use have been protective against ARDS in some clinical and basic research [20, 21, 34] , but this has not been carried through to randomized clinical trials [35] [36] [37] and we found no benefits associated with the regular use of these medications. However, it is perhaps the lack of significance for the roles of obesity and smoking that was most unexpected. Obesity is considered a risk modifier for ARDS because patients with obesity need higher tidal volumes, positive end-expiratory pressures, and sufficiently high peak airway pressures to counter the pressure of their chest wall and abdomen [16, 38] . The lack of difference in this study may reflect our small sample size. Smoking has also been clearly linked as a direct risk modifier in clinical studies [17, 18] , which is known to occur through direct damage to the alveolar epithelium that leads to local inflammation [39, 40] . Despite this, our results did not support it even indirectly, and we consider there to be two main reasons. First, smoking history may have been difficult to assess in critically ill patients. Including a combination of smoking-related biomarkers might have identified more current smokers than the smoking history obtained from patients, surrogates, and medical records [41] . Second, unrecorded medication histories, including the use of inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled beta agonist may have been a confounding factor [42] . It is conceivable that smoking and indirect ARDS are not associated, as is the case with smoking and direct ARDS [23, 25] . Since it is difficult to consider smoking as a protective factor, we only used smoking as an adjustment factor in this study. Risk modifiers for ARDS among patients with nonpulmonary sepsis were similar to those reported for patients with direct and indirect ARDS in previous studies, but they were not the same. This information may help clinicians and researchers. For clinicians, it is important to carefully treat non-pulmonary sepsis particularly in patients with risk modifiers that we have shown. For researchers, it may help to develop future study design and may provide more research on which to assess risks. We recommend that more classifications or adjustments are needed for ARDS because of the large heterogeneity in the syndrome. Several limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. First, we did not capture all ARDS episodes because we only performed screening on the first or fourth day. However, Most ARDS develops within 4 days of admission [2, 11, 15] and most cases occur within 12 h if sepsis is a predisposing condition [43] . Second, we only included patients in ICUs, although it should be noted that most cases would have been admitted to ICUs anyway [2] . Third, there could be some unmeasured confounders because of the post hoc analysis, despite using mostly the same factors as in previous studies [2, 11, 13] . Fourth, we diagnosed ARDS based on the application of the Berlin criteria by the physician in charge. Because the diagnosis of ARDS is difficult [44] , some cases might not have been diagnosed correctly, even if they had respiratory failure. Fifth, we assessed risk modifiers at the first day of registration, yet we know that the value of some factors might be related to timing. However, risk modifier candidates were limited to patient backgrounds and characteristics, which were fixed at data collection. Sixth, based on the results of power analysis, the sample size of this study may not have been enough for the assessment of smoking and BMI as risk modifiers. Finally, our cohort was limited to Japan [2, 11, 13] , and important geographic variations may have been missed [45] . Our retrospective cohort study from the Japanese sepsis registry revealed that admission route, severity, and infection site could be risk modifiers for ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.

The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22–33)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16–28), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06–3.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06–0.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04–5.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05–1.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) comprises heterogenous clinical conditions. Reportedly, the prognosis of ARDS is poor [1, 2] , and once a patient develops ARDS, treatment options are limited to only a few supportive strategies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , making it important to identify patients at a high risk of ARDS [10] . Previous studies have reported a variety of causes and risk factors of ARDS [1, 11] ; however, there is a lack of clarity between these because only a small proportion of patients with these causes and risk factors develop ARDS [12, 13] . Therefore, alternative efforts have been recently focusing on the roles of two types of risk factors: predisposing conditions and risk modifiers [14, 15] . Predisposing conditions are preceding acute pathophysiological events, such as sepsis. Risk modifiers include obesity [15, 16] , smoking status [15, 17, 18] , diabetes mellitus (DM) (reduced risk modifier) [14, 15, 19] , glucocorticoids [20] , statin [21, 22] , non-pulmonary infection (reduced risk modifier) [13, 23] , shock [13, 15] , tachypnea [14, 15] , oxygen supplementation [15, 24] , hematocrit [11] , hypoalbuminemia [14, 15] , acidemia [11, 15] , and disease severity [2, 11, 13] . There is a possibility that ARDS may be precisely predicted using a combination of predisposing conditions and risk modifiers. ARDS has been associated with two major pathophysiologic changes in various proportions. One is the influx of protein-rich effusion to the alveolar space caused by the damage of the local alveolar epithelium and another is leakage to the pulmonary interstitium through the capillary endothelium caused by systemic inflammation. Direct ARDS is associated with higher impairment of alveolar epithelium and lower impairment of capillary endothelium than indirect ARDS [23, 25] . Thus, we think risk modifiers of direct and indirect ARDS should be discussed separately. Indeed to date, however, little has been reported about risk modifiers for ARDS among patients with nonpulmonary sepsis because a large proportion of patients with pulmonary sepsis have been included in previous studies about risk modifiers [2, 14, 15] . We aimed to evaluate the risk modifiers associated with indirect ARDS among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. We conducted a secondary analysis of the sepsis cohort in the Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis, and Trauma (FORECAST) study. This was a multicenter prospective cohort study of 1184 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock enrolled from 59 Intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan and conducted from January 2016 to March 2017 [26] . We included adult patients from the FORECAST database if they were aged ≥ 16 years and had severe sepsis or septic shock caused by non-pulmonary infection. The exclusion criteria were patients with missing data of the first or fourth days of ARDS screening in this study. Patient information was obtained from the FORECAST database, including demographic data, admission source, comorbidities, infection sites, sepsis-related severity scores, and laboratory data. Data collection was performed as part of the routine clinical workup by the original FORECAST investigators. ARDS was diagnosed if present on the first or fourth day of ARDS screening, according to the Berlin ARDS definition [27] . Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined based on the sepsis-2 criteria [28] . Non-pulmonary infection was defined as infection other than pneumonia or empyema. Cases of DM with and without end-organ complications were reported as comorbidities. Also, \"ventilator-free days\" was defined as the number of days within the first 28 days after enrolment, during which a patient was able to breathe without the help of a ventilator. Patients who died during the study were assigned a ventilator-free day of 0. ICU-free days were calculated and scored in a similar manner [29] . Patients were stratified into groups with and without ARDS (i.e., ARDS and No ARDS groups). Descriptive statistics were calculated as proportions for categorical variables and as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) or mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, where appropriate. Statistical differences between two groups were evaluated by univariate analyses, using the chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables because the data did not have a normal distribution. To identify the risk modifiers correlated with having ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis, we developed a multivariate logistic regression model and reported odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We hypothesized that there could be different risk modifiers for indirect ARDS compared with those for direct ARDS reported in previous studies. The primary outcome of interest was having ARDS, and the explanatory variables were selected based on previous research: body mass index, smoking status, DM, glucocorticoids, statin, site of infection, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score. We also include clinically relevant explanatory variables, such as age, gender, admission source, and coexisting conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). However, we did not take variables such as tachypnea, oxygen supplementation, acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia into the logistic regression model because these possible risk modifiers might result from ARDS. Finally, the non-pulmonary Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used in a sensitivity analysis. All p values were two-sided, with p values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the EZR software (Version 1.32) [30] . Of the 1184 patients with severe sepsis in the FORE-CAST study, 817 with non-pulmonary infection were eligible for this study. Another 85 patients were excluded because they had missing data of the first day of ARDS screening. This left a cohort of 69 patients with ARDS and 663 without ARDS on the first day of screening. Of those without ARDS, 35 died on the second or third day and 103 patients had missing data of the fourth day of ARDS screening, so were excluded. Finally, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS at the first or fourth day of ARDS screening (the ARDS group) (Fig. 1 ) The median age was 72 (IQR: 62-81) years and males accounted for 340 patients (57.2%). There were 231 patients (38.9%) with abdominal infection, 147 (24.7%) with urinary tract infection, and 91 (15.3%) with soft tissue infection. The baseline characteristics are compared between patients with and without ARDS in Table 1 . Patients with ARDS had a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index than patients without ARDS, but there were no significant differences between the groups regarding other baseline characteristics, such as age, gender, and admission source. There was no significant difference between patients with and without ARDS regarding previously known risk modifiers for direct and indirect ARDS, including body mass index, DM, smoking status, and site of infection. A higher proportion of patients had septic shock with ARDS (80%) than without ARDS (66%; p = 0.02). Compared to those without ARDS, patients with ARDS had higher severity scores assessed by the APACHE II (26 vs. 21, p < 0.001) and Non-pulmonary SOFA (9 vs. 7, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality in patients with and without ARDS was 29.9% and 16.5%, respectively (p = 0.007) ( Table 2) . Of the 404 patients with septic shock, the in-hospital mortality rate of those with ARDS was significantly higher than that of patients without ARDS (32.8% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.01). The median ventilator-free days for patients with ARDS was less than that for patients without ARDS (15 [0-21] vs. 22 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , p < 0.001), as was the median ICUfree days (14 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] vs. 19 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay by ARDS status (25 vs. 26 , p = 0.39). In terms of survivor dispositions, a larger proportion of patients with ARDS than without ARDS needed to be transferred to other facilities. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we identified three main risk modifiers associated with having ARDS (Table 3) . Notably, the odds of having ARDS were higher for patients from the emergency department than  In this retrospective cohort study of patients with nonpulmonary sepsis, admission route (from the emergency department rather than wards or other hospitals), disease severity (a higher APACHE II score), and infection site (soft tissue rather than abdominal infection) were risk modifiers for non-pulmonary septic ARDS. However, obesity, DM, statins, glucocorticoids, and shock were not statistically associated with ARDS. Duration of onset from infection could be a valid risk modifier of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis. In our results, admission from the emergency department was related to having ARDS, and it is possible that both direct and indirect ARDS developed soon after or at the onset of sepsis [15, 31] . Thus, ARDS may not have occurred after time had passed from admission, and further studies are needed to investigate the timing of the onset of ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis. Site of infection also appeared to be a risk modifier for ARDS in non-pulmonary sepsis. One study showed that abdominal infection was related to with ARDS [23] , and another study showed that soft tissue infection was related to without ARDS in population that included pulmonary infection [13, 32] . The correlation with indirect ARDS in most previous studies may have been attenuated because pulmonary infection is a major predisposing condition and few studies focused on non-pulmonary infection [2, 14, 15] . We showed that, when excluding this, soft tissue infection could be related to having ARDS. Not only pulmonary but also severe soft tissue infection could be a novel risk modifier. However, these patients were more likely to be admitted to wards instead of ICUs, presumably because shock was less common [33] . By limiting our cohort to ICUs, we may have introduced some bias. It is possible that our data for site of infection reflect only disease severity, despite controlling for severity using the APACHE II score and shock status. Pathogens beyond the site of infection may also be related to having ARDS, but our sensitivity analysis did not show a difference (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Further studies are needed to confirm which infection site is more related to developing ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis. We confirmed that the severity of non-pulmonary sepsis (APACHE II score) was related to having ARDS, consistent with the results in previous studies [2, 11, 13] . In this study, we did not exclude the possibility of the pulmonary parameter of the APACHE II score representing pre-existing ARDS in the emergency department. Thus, we performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the APACHE II score with the non-pulmonary SOFA score, and it showed similar results to the main analysis (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). However, having shock was not related to having ARDS in our population, indicating that having ARDS in nonpulmonary sepsis might be associated with the development of multiple organ failure instead of circulatory failure (shock) [2, 31] . Further studies are needed to determine organ failures that are more likely to occur with ARDS. We did not show roles for obesity, DM, statins, and glucocorticoids which have been shown to be risk modifiers for ARDS in previous studies. Although they were risk modifiers in direct and indirect ARDS combined, the tendencies of the ORs were similar. Otherwise, obesity may not be a risk modifier of ARDS due to nonpulmonary sepsis because of mechanism is not the same [23, 25] . DM, statin use, and glucocorticoid use have been protective against ARDS in some clinical and basic research [20, 21, 34] , but this has not been carried through to randomized clinical trials [35] [36] [37] and we found no benefits associated with the regular use of these medications. However, it is perhaps the lack of significance for the roles of obesity and smoking that was most unexpected. Obesity is considered a risk modifier for ARDS because patients with obesity need higher tidal volumes, positive end-expiratory pressures, and sufficiently high peak airway pressures to counter the pressure of their chest wall and abdomen [16, 38] . The lack of difference in this study may reflect our small sample size. Smoking has also been clearly linked as a direct risk modifier in clinical studies [17, 18] , which is known to occur through direct damage to the alveolar epithelium that leads to local inflammation [39, 40] . Despite this, our results did not support it even indirectly, and we consider there to be two main reasons. First, smoking history may have been difficult to assess in critically ill patients. Including a combination of smoking-related biomarkers might have identified more current smokers than the smoking history obtained from patients, surrogates, and medical records [41] . Second, unrecorded medication histories, including the use of inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled beta agonist may have been a confounding factor [42] . It is conceivable that smoking and indirect ARDS are not associated, as is the case with smoking and direct ARDS [23, 25] . Since it is difficult to consider smoking as a protective factor, we only used smoking as an adjustment factor in this study. Risk modifiers for ARDS among patients with nonpulmonary sepsis were similar to those reported for patients with direct and indirect ARDS in previous studies, but they were not the same. This information may help clinicians and researchers. For clinicians, it is important to carefully treat non-pulmonary sepsis particularly in patients with risk modifiers that we have shown. For researchers, it may help to develop future study design and may provide more research on which to assess risks. We recommend that more classifications or adjustments are needed for ARDS because of the large heterogeneity in the syndrome. Several limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. First, we did not capture all ARDS episodes because we only performed screening on the first or fourth day. However, Most ARDS develops within 4 days of admission [2, 11, 15] and most cases occur within 12 h if sepsis is a predisposing condition [43] . Second, we only included patients in ICUs, although it should be noted that most cases would have been admitted to ICUs anyway [2] . Third, there could be some unmeasured confounders because of the post hoc analysis, despite using mostly the same factors as in previous studies [2, 11, 13] . Fourth, we diagnosed ARDS based on the application of the Berlin criteria by the physician in charge. Because the diagnosis of ARDS is difficult [44] , some cases might not have been diagnosed correctly, even if they had respiratory failure. Fifth, we assessed risk modifiers at the first day of registration, yet we know that the value of some factors might be related to timing. However, risk modifier candidates were limited to patient backgrounds and characteristics, which were fixed at data collection. Sixth, based on the results of power analysis, the sample size of this study may not have been enough for the assessment of smoking and BMI as risk modifiers. Finally, our cohort was limited to Japan [2, 11, 13] , and important geographic variations may have been missed [45] . Our retrospective cohort study from the Japanese sepsis registry revealed that admission route, severity, and infection site could be risk modifiers for ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.

         "Millions are exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) every year, but not all acquire the virus, suggesting a potential role for host genetics in the moderation of HIV-1 acquisition. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28–42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV–1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.",

         "However, population genetic methods have developed substantially in recent years, now allowing for powerful, biologically-informative analyses even in moderately-sized GWAS. For example, gene enrichment analyses can be applied to summary statistics to identify genes involved in risk, as well as cell types more likely mediating susceptibility. This is achieved by averaging association signals from multiple neighboring polymorphisms within protein-coding genes, and comparing lists of the resulting genes to the transcriptional profiles of mammalian cell types 17, 18 . Methods like Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) 19 and Linkage Disequilibrium Adjusted Kinships (LDAK) 20 further allow the estimation of SNP heritability based on GWAS results. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), in turn, can be used to explore genetic overlap between traits, and are useful in establishing the effect genetic predisposition has on biological parameters. PRS could even be used to model genetic risk for a trait (e.g. HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility) in a cohort of unaffected individuals (e.g. HIV-1-negative individuals). This, for example, could allow us to model the impact of genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition on biological systems prior to HIV-1 infection, which could ultimately aid in the identification of new vaccine or drug development strategies. Here, we apply these modern population genetic methods to the largest GWAS of HIV-1 acquisition, and identify novel factors and complex traits associated with HIV-1 acquisition. The largest GWAS meta-analysis of HIV-1 acquisition to-date tested over 8 million common polymorphisms for association with HIV-1 acquisition in 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls 10 . We estimated the SNP heritability (SNP h 2 ) of HIV-1 acquisition by analyzing these GWAS results using LD Hub (LDSC-based) 19 and SumHer-GC 20 (based on the LDAK model, correcting for possible hidden population structure). We observed that SNP h 2 = 0.28 ± 0.05 (standard deviation; SD) under the LDSC model, suggesting that HIV-1 acquisition is a heritable trait, replicating a previous analysis of the same dataset 21 . Analysis with SumHer-GC showed a higher estimate of SNP h 2 (0.42 ± 0.08), consistent with LDAK being able to capture a larger proportion of SNPs contributing to SNP h 2 , relative to LDSC. To better understand which behavioral parameters might be important in moderating HIV-1 acquisition, we performed genetic correlation analyses leveraging on GWAS data from 516 heritable traits assessed in the UK Biobank via LD Hub, which contains genetic association results from up to 488,377 individuals. This LDSC-based analysis revealed 9 positive correlations with HIV-1 acquisition, including prospective memory, ascertained using cognitive tests (rg = 0.39, SE = 0.09, P = 7.15 × 10 −6 ); lower levels of education, ascertained by having no higher qualifications (rg = 0.21, SE = 0.05, P = 5.59 × 10 −5 ); self-reported smoking (rg = 0.28, SE = 0.06, P = 1.33 × 10 −5 ); and self-reported vigorous exercising (rg = 0.27, SE = 0.06, P = 2.76 × 10 −5 ; Bonferroni adjusted P (for 516 traits) <0.05 for all; Fig. 1A ; Supplemental Table 1 ). We also observed 5 negative associations with acquisition, including socioeconomic traits like alcohol intake with meals (rg = −0.28, SE = 0.06, P = 3.12 × 10 −7 ), having a higher qualification (rg = −0.20, SE = 0.05, P = 1.99 × 10 −5 ), and age at which female participants had their first live birth (rg = −0.25, SE = 0.06, P = 6.46 × 10 −5 ). We validated the Bonferroni-significant genetic correlations using SumHer-GC (Fig. 1B) , and observed highly concordant estimates of genetic correlation calculated between the two methods (Pearson's r = 0.98, P = 2.59 × 10 −9 ). EFCAB14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition. To perform our gene-level enrichment analysis, gene-level statistics and weighted p-values were generated from GWAS summary statistics using MAGMA 22 , adjusting associations for gene size, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and linkage disequilibrium. This analysis revealed a contribution of several protein-coding genes to HIV-1 acquisition, with gene-level Q-Q plots highlighting the degree of polygenicity observed, and the abundance of contributing genes relative to an expected normal distribution ( Fig. 2A ; Supplemental Table 2 ). We identified a novel gene involved in HIV-1 acquisition, the EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 (EFCAB14), on chromosome 1p33 (Z-score = 4.56, enrichment P = 2.56 × 10 −6 , Bonferroni corrected P = 4.7 × 10 −2 ), which is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, according to The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project 23 . The highest association signal at this locus is the non-coding variant rs8851 (P = 5.57 × 10 −7 ; Fig. 2B ), which is also an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for EFCAB14. The risk (G-) allele of rs8851 is associated with lower expression of EFCAB14 in multiple tissues, including whole blood, skin, adipose tissue, the cerebellum and arteries (P < 1 × 10 −3 for all) 23 . These findings suggest that genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition at this locus is conferred via reduced expression of EFCAB14, and not by altered expression of neighboring genes such as the ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 1 (ATPAF1) or the testis expressed 38 (TEX38) genes (Fig. 2C) . Outside of chromosome 1p33, the top gene-level association signal was on chromosome 15q22.31, at the ubiquitin specific peptidase 3 gene (USP3), although this was not significant after multiple testing correction (enrichment P = 4.96 × 10 −6 , Bonferroni corrected P > 0.05; Fig. 2D ). We aimed to investigate the cellular basis for the biological and behavioral parameters implicated in HIV-1 acquisition, and therefore investigated the cell types enriched for variants associated with this trait. Two independent gene-set enrichment analyses using FUMA 24 showed that cells likely mediating acquisition included T-cells (P = 8.54 × 10 −4 ) and, independently, neurons from the striatum, hippocampus and globus pallidus under a false discovery rate of 10% (top association signals, respectively: P = 1.22 × 10 −4 , 2.49 × 10 −4 , and 6.23 × 10 −4 ; q < 0.10 for all; Fig. 3A ,B, Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 ). Polygenic risk score for HIV-1 acquisition is negatively associated with circulating CCL17 levels. We utilized findings from the GWAS performed by McLaren and colleagues (2013) to calculate www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ predisposition correlated with levels of 35 blood-based inflammatory markers. Our rationale was to better understand how genetic susceptibility expresses itself in the pre-exposed immune system, and in particular how it affects inflammatory cytokines, which are molecules that can be modified via pharmacological intervention, and are thought to be key moderators of HIV-1 infection 25, 26 . A preliminary analysis utilized all polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 acquisition under a P association threshold (P T ) = 0.5 to calculate the PRS, and to test its correlation with the levels of 35 inflammatory markers. This analysis showed that HIV-1 acquisition was significantly and specifically associated with lower levels of the chemokine CCL17 (ß = −1644.32, standard error (SE) = 496.62, P = 1.00 × 10 −3 , Bonferroni corrected P (for 35 tests) = 3.50 × 10 −2 , variance explained = 2.74%; Fig. 3C ). A sensitivity analysis revealed that PRS at every tested P T also significantly predicted levels of this chemokine, with highest significance at P T = 0.061 (ß = −800.52, SE = 180.07, P = 1.14 × 10 −5 , corrected P = 5.11 × 10 −4 , variance explained = 4.84%; Fig. 3D ). Importantly, this effect was additionally observed when considering individuals of European-only ancestry in the cohort (ß = −794.27, SE = 190.81 P = 4.21 × 10 −5 ), matching the ethnicity of the individuals in the base GWAS used to construct the PRS, and after removing the major histocompatibility complex from the PRS calculation (ß = −526.42, SE = 158.08, P = 9.50 × 10 −4 ). The inverse correlation observed suggests that individuals that have a higher genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition are more likely to have lower blood levels of CCL17 (Fig. 3E ). The correlation values observed for the 14 Bonferroni-significant traits associated with HIV-1 acquisition in the LDSC method were highly concordant with results using the LDAK method (Pearson's r = 0.98, P = 2.59 × 10 −9 ). HIV-1 acquisition consists of behavioral risk parameters moderating exposure as well as biological factors controlling viral entry and replication. However, the genetic aspects of HIV-1 acquisition (outside of the CCR5 Δ32 mutation) have been understudied, in part because no robust genome-wide significant variants were found in early studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , which led to the premature assumption that acquisition was not substantially moderated by common genetic variants. The GWAS analyzed here, by McLaren and colleagues (2013), did not identify genome-wide significant polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 acquisition (after correcting association signals for frailty bias), but population genetic methods have advanced considerably in recent years, now allowing for powerful inferences about genetic traits using GWAS summary statistics 19, 22, 24, 27 , even in moderately powered studies. For instance, we calculated heritability estimates of HIV-1 acquisition using cutting edge methods like LDSC and LDAK, which would otherwise be challenging using traditional twin and family methods. The level of SNP h 2 observed for acquisition (LDSC: 0.28 ± 0.05; LDAK: 0.42 ± 0.08) was greater or comparable to that of traits considered highly heritable, such as body mass index (LDSC: 0.09 ± 0.01; LDAK: 0.33 ± 0.03), height (LDSC: 0.20 ± 0.02; LDAK: 0.46 ± 0.04), and schizophrenia (LDSC: 0.19 ± 0.01; LDAK: 0.42 ± 0.02) 20 . Overall, these results highlight the contribution of common variants to HIV-1 acquisition risk, showing this is a heritable trait. To understand the underlying genetic factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition, we performed genetic correlation analyses in LD Hub, which leverages on data from ~500,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, to investigate how acquisition genetics correlates with heritable traits assessed in this large population sample. We observed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ genetic correlations between HIV-1 acquisition and heritable phenotypes associated with socio-economic factors, corroborating previous epidemiological work, and further highlighting the need for prevention strategies tailored to individuals who most need it 28 . We further validated the genetic correlations using the independent SumHer-GC method, supporting these results. Our results also validate and expand the current understanding of the biological basis of HIV-1 acquisition. In a preliminary enrichment analysis that aimed to identify the cell types that mediate HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility throughout the body, we observed that polymorphisms implicated in acquisition were enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, which are the main targets for HIV-1 replication 29 . We further tested the enrichment of HIV-1 variants for genes expressed across a range of neural cell types, since these cells mediate behavior and could explain certain genetic correlations observed with HIV-1 acquisition. We observed a significant enrichment for striatal and hippocampal neurons in association with HIV-1 acquisition, which is particularly striking considering they are brain areas implicated in the regulation of reward and pleasure 30, 31 . Alternatively, these cell types may represent those which harbor HIV-1 and most effectively hide it from the immune system, propagating a sustained infection. Furthermore, the gene-level enrichment analysis identified EFCAB14 as a susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition, on chromosome 1p33. This gene is ubiquitously expressed in the body, and the risk www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ allele of rs8851 is known to reduce expression of EFCAB14 across multiple tissues. Proteins containing EF-Hand Calcium Binding domains in general are implicated in functions ranging from intracellular calcium buffering, signal transduction and muscle contraction 32 , but future studies are warranted to investigate the function of EFCAB14 specifically, particularly in the context of HIV-1 acquisition. Another emerging method in population genetics is polygenic risk scoring 33, 34 . We modelled how genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition expresses itself in the pre-exposed immune profile using a cohort of HIV-1 negative individuals. By considering genetic risk as a continuous trait in a population setting, we can more powerfully determine the influences of the genetic risk signal on innate biological systems such as inflammatory marker expression, without confounders (e.g. drug use, other infections) more commonly associated with individuals from high-risk groups. Moreover, previous studies that have compared high-risk individuals who do not acquire HIV-1, with those that do, are likely confounded by the fact that HIV-1 has an influence on the immune system and inflammatory profile of the individual, which may not correspond to the pre-exposed immune profile associated with risk or resilience. In particular, we studied how genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition affects inflammatory cytokines, which are immune messengers that are relatively easy to assay, can be modified via pharmacological intervention, and are thought to be key moderators of HIV-1 infection 25, 26 . We observed that PRS for HIV-1 acquisition inversely correlated with CCL17 levels in the blood of HIV-1 negative individuals, suggesting that levels of this chemokine should be considered in clinical trials for biomarker, drug and vaccine development. CCL17 is known to regulate the development and maturation of T-cells in the thymus, as well as their trafficking during inflammation [35] [36] [37] . Neutralization of this chemokine by antibody treatment has been shown to block the recruitment of T-cells in the lung (ameliorating respiratory allergy) 38 . We hypothesize that increased CCL17 levels may increase the influx of inflammatory cells, which could help eliminate HIV-1-infected cells before the establishment of a systemic infection. However, CCL17 levels may represent only one of many biological mechanisms implicated in, or co-occurring with, HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility, and further research is needed to better understand this relationship. Despite the insights provided, our study has limitations, including the modest cohort size of European-only individuals in the GWAS analyzed. Analyses of larger cohorts from different ancestry groups and well-characterized infection routes have the potential to improve our understanding of HIV-1 acquisition, by improving the identification of specific SNPs and genes involved. Future well-powered GWAS of HIV-1 acquisition comparing high risk individuals who are infected versus those who are not will more likely tease apart the biological risk mechanisms implicated in viral resilience from the behavioral risk factors. This could be studied in areas where the risk for HIV-1 is already relatively high in the general population (e.g. South Africa), and where viral entry and replication may represent more important components of acquisition than risk behaviors. Furthermore, although we validated our estimates of heritability and genetic correlations by using two independent methods, additional cohorts are needed to replicate our findings, including those obtained with the PRS analysis. Moreover, our genetic correlation analysis relies on self-report information from the UK Biobank, where individuals (aged 40+) are probably older than the average age of individuals diagnosed with HIV-1. Consequently, behaviors relevant to HIV-1 acquisition that may be more common in a younger cohort (e.g. drug use), could have been absent (or not reported) in the UK Biobank. Where we do find genetic correlations with HIV-1 risk, we cannot currently infer cause and effect, but this is something which may be achievable in the future via a Mendelian randomization design, once larger GWAS are able to detect robust genome-wide significant predictors of HIV-1 acquisition. Finally, the cytokine panel we investigated in association with PRS for acquisition was limited to 35 proteins, and it is possible that other inflammatory markers which we did not assess may be more relevant to this trait. To conclude, our results show that HIV-1 acquisition genetics impinges upon behavioral, cellular, and immune factors. By leveraging on modern population genetic methods, our work provides a novel framework to study HIV-1 acquisition as a complex phenotype, advancing our understanding of the underlying risk factors. Our results suggest that in addition to environmental risk factors, there is a polygenic component to HIV-1 acquisition that should be explored further in clinical studies. In addition, our work supports the investigation of future intervention strategies surrounding education and smoking behavior. In particular, there needs to be studies investigating whether smoking simply represents a proxy for unhealthy behaviors, or whether it actively influences biological processes linked to HIV-1 acquisition. Similarly, CCL17 and EFCAB14 should also be investigated with respect to their potential role as biomarkers for HIV-1 acquisition and as drug targets. As demonstrated here, GWAS can be very informative even when analyzing moderately sized cohorts, but its true potential to unveil the host genetic mechanisms influencing HIV-1 acquisition will likely only be unlocked with the creation of collaborative initiatives and analyses of larger cohorts. GWAS summary statistics. We obtained summary statistics from the largest HIV-1 acquisition GWAS meta-analysis to-date, performed by McLaren and colleagues, which analyzed 6,334 HIV-1-positive individuals and 7,247 HIV-1-negative population controls of European ancestry, collected in Europe, North America, Australia and Africa 10 . The HIV-1-positive group consisted of individuals who acquired HIV-1 by sexual contact (homosexual and heterosexual, N = 3,311), via the parenteral route (injection drug use and transfusion, N = 1,046), or by unknown means (N = 2,086) . The authors of this GWAS found no association of genotype with specific means of acquisition. We excluded variants not genotyped across all studies in the meta-analysis, those with a minor allele frequency <0.01, and those located within the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6, 26-34 Mb), due to its complex linkage disequilibrium structure. Heritability estimates and genetic correlations. We applied LD score regression in LD Hub v1.9.1 19 to estimate the heritability of HIV-1 acquisition and to identify genetically associated traits, based on 516 heritable Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:3304 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59256-0 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ phenotypes assessed in the UK Biobank 39 . The UK Biobank phenotypically characterized and genotyped 488,377 participants aged between 40-69 years, enabling LD Hub to test for genetic correlations between HIV-1 acquistion and traits of interest (e.g. disease states, behaviors and socioeconomic traits) 40 . Results were plotted in R 41 using the \"EnhancedVolcano\" library 42 . Estimation of SNP h 2 and genetic correlations were also performed using SumHer-GC, from the LDAK package 20 , with the genomic control feature enabled, to control for potential hidden population structure in the data, even though the authors of the original GWAS did not identify genomic inflation (see McLaren and colleagues (2013) 10 ). In the LDSC model, all SNPs are assumed to contribute equally to the phenotype, whereas in the LDAK model (which is expected to capture a larger proportion of heritability), a SNP with higher frequency is expected to contribute more towards heritability than one with lower frequency in the population, and a SNP in a region of low linkage disequilibrium contributes more than one in a region of high linkage disequilibrium. Gene-level and gene set enrichment analyses. We used the Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA) to identify genes and cell types associated with HIV-1 acquisition genetics, as described elsewhere 17, 18 . Briefly, gene-level statistics and weighted p-values were generated from GWAS summary statistics, adjusting gene-level associations for gene size, SNP density and LD. Input SNPs were mapped to 18,439 protein coding genes using a 10 kb upstream and downstream window, and a Bonferroni cut-off was applied to determine significance (P cut-off = 0.05/18,439 protein-coding genes = 2.71 × 10 −6 ) 19 . Next, the gene-set enrichment analysis used two single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets available in FUMA to identify cell types enriched for genes associated with HIV-1 acquisition under the false discovery rate of 10% (q < 0.10). Specifically, to identify particular tissues or organs involved in HIV-1 acquisition, we tested the transcriptional profile of 75 murine cell types (TabulaMuris_droplet_all) for enrichment with HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility genes. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of well-curated single cell transcriptome data from Mus musculus, containing information from 100,605 cells from 20 organs and tissues 43 . To identify specific neural populations that could drive the behaviors observed in the genetic correlations, we tested the transcriptional profile of 565 neuronal cell types (DropViz_all_level2) for enrichment with HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility genes. This dataset contains the transcriptional signature of 690,000 cells from the mouse brain, which have been previously used to investigate the cellular mechanisms of behavior 44 . the South east London community Health Study. We aimed to assess how HIV-1 acquisition risk might be moderated by an individual's immune profile prior to infection, and so we tested how polygenic risk for HIV-1 acquisition correlated with the expression of 35 inflammatory markers. We studied HIV-1-negative population controls from the South East London Community Health Study (SELCoH) [45] [46] [47] , where HIV-1-negative status was determined based on self-report. For further details on the full SELCoH study, please see Hatch et al. 43 . SELCoH aimed to investigate mental and physical health in the general population in London, UK. The subsample analyzed in our study consisted of 406 individuals for which both inflammatory and genetic data were available. The SELCoH study received approval from King's College London research ethics committee, reference PNM/12/13-152. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants at the time of sample collection. The 35 inflammatory markers represent adequately expressed cytokines from an initial panel of 42, which were originally assayed in relation to major depression risk, as described previously 48 . The mean age of our sample was 48.7 ± 15.1 (standard deviation), with a mean body mass index of 27.3 ± 5.5. The cohort is representative of the source population and consisted of 45.3% males; 20.9% current smokers and 40.4% ex-smokers; and 56.8% White British, 8.4% Black Caribbean, 10.9% Black African, 14.6% White Other, 6.2% Non-White Other, and 3.2% Mixed. Participants received detailed and repeated phenotypic assessments as part of three separate phases. The first phase aimed to assess common physical and mental disorders in South East London; the second, to examine the roles of historical social context and policy in shaping patterns of health inequalities; and the third, to collect biological specimens from a subset of participants, including blood for serum separation and DNA for genotyping. Serum and DNA were extracted and stored at −80 °C until use, as described previously 47,48 . Quantification and analysis of cytokines. Serum levels (pg/mL) of 35 blood-based markers were assessed in blood samples from the SELCoH cohort using multiplex ELISA-based technology provided by the Meso Scale Discovery Biomarker kits, as described previously 48 . For each marker, we adjusted for the effects of assay run, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking (never, current, former) and ethnicity, by taking standardized residuals (z-scores). Z-scores were then used in downstream PRS analyses. DnA genotyping. DNA samples from the SELCoH cohort were sent to the Affymetrix Research Services Laboratory in Santa Clara, California, USA. Genotyping was assayed using the UK Biobank Axiom Array (r3) which comprises of 820,967 genetic markers (Affymetrix, California, United States). Genotype data was put through quality control measures as described previously, and used to construct polygenic risk scores 47 . polygenic risk scores. Individualized polygenic risk scores (PRS) within the SELCoH sample were calculated using PRSice-2, a PRS quantification software 33, 34 . This pipeline uses summary statistics from a base GWAS to generate individualized PRS in a target dataset. Briefly, the number of risk alleles in the base dataset are multiplied by SNPs' effect sizes to generate individualized PRS in the target dataset. PRSice-2 clumps SNPs in the genotype files of the target dataset and removes those in high LD to avoid polygenic score inflation. For our initial screen, we constructed a PRS using all SNPs in the GWAS with P < 0.5. We tested whether this score predicted adjusted inflammatory marker levels in PRSice-2, covarying for seven population dimensions generated using principal component analysis applied to LD-pruned SNPs in PLINK 1.9 49 . Our relaxed p-value threshold (P T ) was initially selected based on earlier studies which revealed that highly polygenic phenotypes in moderately powered GWAS are better captured using a relaxed cut-off 50 . We subsequently performed sensitivity analyses for",
         "The behavioral, cellular and immune mediators of HIV-1 acquisition: New insights from population genetics. Millions are exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) every year, but not all acquire the virus, suggesting a potential role for host genetics in the moderation of HIV-1 acquisition. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28–42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV–1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.. However, population genetic methods have developed substantially in recent years, now allowing for powerful, biologically-informative analyses even in moderately-sized GWAS. For example, gene enrichment analyses can be applied to summary statistics to identify genes involved in risk, as well as cell types more likely mediating susceptibility. This is achieved by averaging association signals from multiple neighboring polymorphisms within protein-coding genes, and comparing lists of the resulting genes to the transcriptional profiles of mammalian cell types 17, 18 . Methods like Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) 19 and Linkage Disequilibrium Adjusted Kinships (LDAK) 20 further allow the estimation of SNP heritability based on GWAS results. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), in turn, can be used to explore genetic overlap between traits, and are useful in establishing the effect genetic predisposition has on biological parameters. PRS could even be used to model genetic risk for a trait (e.g. HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility) in a cohort of unaffected individuals (e.g. HIV-1-negative individuals). This, for example, could allow us to model the impact of genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition on biological systems prior to HIV-1 infection, which could ultimately aid in the identification of new vaccine or drug development strategies. Here, we apply these modern population genetic methods to the largest GWAS of HIV-1 acquisition, and identify novel factors and complex traits associated with HIV-1 acquisition. The largest GWAS meta-analysis of HIV-1 acquisition to-date tested over 8 million common polymorphisms for association with HIV-1 acquisition in 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls 10 . We estimated the SNP heritability (SNP h 2 ) of HIV-1 acquisition by analyzing these GWAS results using LD Hub (LDSC-based) 19 and SumHer-GC 20 (based on the LDAK model, correcting for possible hidden population structure). We observed that SNP h 2 = 0.28 ± 0.05 (standard deviation; SD) under the LDSC model, suggesting that HIV-1 acquisition is a heritable trait, replicating a previous analysis of the same dataset 21 . Analysis with SumHer-GC showed a higher estimate of SNP h 2 (0.42 ± 0.08), consistent with LDAK being able to capture a larger proportion of SNPs contributing to SNP h 2 , relative to LDSC. To better understand which behavioral parameters might be important in moderating HIV-1 acquisition, we performed genetic correlation analyses leveraging on GWAS data from 516 heritable traits assessed in the UK Biobank via LD Hub, which contains genetic association results from up to 488,377 individuals. This LDSC-based analysis revealed 9 positive correlations with HIV-1 acquisition, including prospective memory, ascertained using cognitive tests (rg = 0.39, SE = 0.09, P = 7.15 × 10 −6 ); lower levels of education, ascertained by having no higher qualifications (rg = 0.21, SE = 0.05, P = 5.59 × 10 −5 ); self-reported smoking (rg = 0.28, SE = 0.06, P = 1.33 × 10 −5 ); and self-reported vigorous exercising (rg = 0.27, SE = 0.06, P = 2.76 × 10 −5 ; Bonferroni adjusted P (for 516 traits) <0.05 for all; Fig. 1A ; Supplemental Table 1 ). We also observed 5 negative associations with acquisition, including socioeconomic traits like alcohol intake with meals (rg = −0.28, SE = 0.06, P = 3.12 × 10 −7 ), having a higher qualification (rg = −0.20, SE = 0.05, P = 1.99 × 10 −5 ), and age at which female participants had their first live birth (rg = −0.25, SE = 0.06, P = 6.46 × 10 −5 ). We validated the Bonferroni-significant genetic correlations using SumHer-GC (Fig. 1B) , and observed highly concordant estimates of genetic correlation calculated between the two methods (Pearson's r = 0.98, P = 2.59 × 10 −9 ). EFCAB14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition. To perform our gene-level enrichment analysis, gene-level statistics and weighted p-values were generated from GWAS summary statistics using MAGMA 22 , adjusting associations for gene size, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and linkage disequilibrium. This analysis revealed a contribution of several protein-coding genes to HIV-1 acquisition, with gene-level Q-Q plots highlighting the degree of polygenicity observed, and the abundance of contributing genes relative to an expected normal distribution ( Fig. 2A ; Supplemental Table 2 ). We identified a novel gene involved in HIV-1 acquisition, the EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 (EFCAB14), on chromosome 1p33 (Z-score = 4.56, enrichment P = 2.56 × 10 −6 , Bonferroni corrected P = 4.7 × 10 −2 ), which is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, according to The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project 23 . The highest association signal at this locus is the non-coding variant rs8851 (P = 5.57 × 10 −7 ; Fig. 2B ), which is also an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for EFCAB14. The risk (G-) allele of rs8851 is associated with lower expression of EFCAB14 in multiple tissues, including whole blood, skin, adipose tissue, the cerebellum and arteries (P < 1 × 10 −3 for all) 23 . These findings suggest that genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition at this locus is conferred via reduced expression of EFCAB14, and not by altered expression of neighboring genes such as the ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 1 (ATPAF1) or the testis expressed 38 (TEX38) genes (Fig. 2C) . Outside of chromosome 1p33, the top gene-level association signal was on chromosome 15q22.31, at the ubiquitin specific peptidase 3 gene (USP3), although this was not significant after multiple testing correction (enrichment P = 4.96 × 10 −6 , Bonferroni corrected P > 0.05; Fig. 2D ). We aimed to investigate the cellular basis for the biological and behavioral parameters implicated in HIV-1 acquisition, and therefore investigated the cell types enriched for variants associated with this trait. Two independent gene-set enrichment analyses using FUMA 24 showed that cells likely mediating acquisition included T-cells (P = 8.54 × 10 −4 ) and, independently, neurons from the striatum, hippocampus and globus pallidus under a false discovery rate of 10% (top association signals, respectively: P = 1.22 × 10 −4 , 2.49 × 10 −4 , and 6.23 × 10 −4 ; q < 0.10 for all; Fig. 3A ,B, Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 ). Polygenic risk score for HIV-1 acquisition is negatively associated with circulating CCL17 levels. We utilized findings from the GWAS performed by McLaren and colleagues (2013) to calculate www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ predisposition correlated with levels of 35 blood-based inflammatory markers. Our rationale was to better understand how genetic susceptibility expresses itself in the pre-exposed immune system, and in particular how it affects inflammatory cytokines, which are molecules that can be modified via pharmacological intervention, and are thought to be key moderators of HIV-1 infection 25, 26 . A preliminary analysis utilized all polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 acquisition under a P association threshold (P T ) = 0.5 to calculate the PRS, and to test its correlation with the levels of 35 inflammatory markers. This analysis showed that HIV-1 acquisition was significantly and specifically associated with lower levels of the chemokine CCL17 (ß = −1644.32, standard error (SE) = 496.62, P = 1.00 × 10 −3 , Bonferroni corrected P (for 35 tests) = 3.50 × 10 −2 , variance explained = 2.74%; Fig. 3C ). A sensitivity analysis revealed that PRS at every tested P T also significantly predicted levels of this chemokine, with highest significance at P T = 0.061 (ß = −800.52, SE = 180.07, P = 1.14 × 10 −5 , corrected P = 5.11 × 10 −4 , variance explained = 4.84%; Fig. 3D ). Importantly, this effect was additionally observed when considering individuals of European-only ancestry in the cohort (ß = −794.27, SE = 190.81 P = 4.21 × 10 −5 ), matching the ethnicity of the individuals in the base GWAS used to construct the PRS, and after removing the major histocompatibility complex from the PRS calculation (ß = −526.42, SE = 158.08, P = 9.50 × 10 −4 ). The inverse correlation observed suggests that individuals that have a higher genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition are more likely to have lower blood levels of CCL17 (Fig. 3E ). The correlation values observed for the 14 Bonferroni-significant traits associated with HIV-1 acquisition in the LDSC method were highly concordant with results using the LDAK method (Pearson's r = 0.98, P = 2.59 × 10 −9 ). HIV-1 acquisition consists of behavioral risk parameters moderating exposure as well as biological factors controlling viral entry and replication. However, the genetic aspects of HIV-1 acquisition (outside of the CCR5 Δ32 mutation) have been understudied, in part because no robust genome-wide significant variants were found in early studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , which led to the premature assumption that acquisition was not substantially moderated by common genetic variants. The GWAS analyzed here, by McLaren and colleagues (2013), did not identify genome-wide significant polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 acquisition (after correcting association signals for frailty bias), but population genetic methods have advanced considerably in recent years, now allowing for powerful inferences about genetic traits using GWAS summary statistics 19, 22, 24, 27 , even in moderately powered studies. For instance, we calculated heritability estimates of HIV-1 acquisition using cutting edge methods like LDSC and LDAK, which would otherwise be challenging using traditional twin and family methods. The level of SNP h 2 observed for acquisition (LDSC: 0.28 ± 0.05; LDAK: 0.42 ± 0.08) was greater or comparable to that of traits considered highly heritable, such as body mass index (LDSC: 0.09 ± 0.01; LDAK: 0.33 ± 0.03), height (LDSC: 0.20 ± 0.02; LDAK: 0.46 ± 0.04), and schizophrenia (LDSC: 0.19 ± 0.01; LDAK: 0.42 ± 0.02) 20 . Overall, these results highlight the contribution of common variants to HIV-1 acquisition risk, showing this is a heritable trait. To understand the underlying genetic factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition, we performed genetic correlation analyses in LD Hub, which leverages on data from ~500,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, to investigate how acquisition genetics correlates with heritable traits assessed in this large population sample. We observed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ genetic correlations between HIV-1 acquisition and heritable phenotypes associated with socio-economic factors, corroborating previous epidemiological work, and further highlighting the need for prevention strategies tailored to individuals who most need it 28 . We further validated the genetic correlations using the independent SumHer-GC method, supporting these results. Our results also validate and expand the current understanding of the biological basis of HIV-1 acquisition. In a preliminary enrichment analysis that aimed to identify the cell types that mediate HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility throughout the body, we observed that polymorphisms implicated in acquisition were enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, which are the main targets for HIV-1 replication 29 . We further tested the enrichment of HIV-1 variants for genes expressed across a range of neural cell types, since these cells mediate behavior and could explain certain genetic correlations observed with HIV-1 acquisition. We observed a significant enrichment for striatal and hippocampal neurons in association with HIV-1 acquisition, which is particularly striking considering they are brain areas implicated in the regulation of reward and pleasure 30, 31 . Alternatively, these cell types may represent those which harbor HIV-1 and most effectively hide it from the immune system, propagating a sustained infection. Furthermore, the gene-level enrichment analysis identified EFCAB14 as a susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition, on chromosome 1p33. This gene is ubiquitously expressed in the body, and the risk www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ allele of rs8851 is known to reduce expression of EFCAB14 across multiple tissues. Proteins containing EF-Hand Calcium Binding domains in general are implicated in functions ranging from intracellular calcium buffering, signal transduction and muscle contraction 32 , but future studies are warranted to investigate the function of EFCAB14 specifically, particularly in the context of HIV-1 acquisition. Another emerging method in population genetics is polygenic risk scoring 33, 34 . We modelled how genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition expresses itself in the pre-exposed immune profile using a cohort of HIV-1 negative individuals. By considering genetic risk as a continuous trait in a population setting, we can more powerfully determine the influences of the genetic risk signal on innate biological systems such as inflammatory marker expression, without confounders (e.g. drug use, other infections) more commonly associated with individuals from high-risk groups. Moreover, previous studies that have compared high-risk individuals who do not acquire HIV-1, with those that do, are likely confounded by the fact that HIV-1 has an influence on the immune system and inflammatory profile of the individual, which may not correspond to the pre-exposed immune profile associated with risk or resilience. In particular, we studied how genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition affects inflammatory cytokines, which are immune messengers that are relatively easy to assay, can be modified via pharmacological intervention, and are thought to be key moderators of HIV-1 infection 25, 26 . We observed that PRS for HIV-1 acquisition inversely correlated with CCL17 levels in the blood of HIV-1 negative individuals, suggesting that levels of this chemokine should be considered in clinical trials for biomarker, drug and vaccine development. CCL17 is known to regulate the development and maturation of T-cells in the thymus, as well as their trafficking during inflammation [35] [36] [37] . Neutralization of this chemokine by antibody treatment has been shown to block the recruitment of T-cells in the lung (ameliorating respiratory allergy) 38 . We hypothesize that increased CCL17 levels may increase the influx of inflammatory cells, which could help eliminate HIV-1-infected cells before the establishment of a systemic infection. However, CCL17 levels may represent only one of many biological mechanisms implicated in, or co-occurring with, HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility, and further research is needed to better understand this relationship. Despite the insights provided, our study has limitations, including the modest cohort size of European-only individuals in the GWAS analyzed. Analyses of larger cohorts from different ancestry groups and well-characterized infection routes have the potential to improve our understanding of HIV-1 acquisition, by improving the identification of specific SNPs and genes involved. Future well-powered GWAS of HIV-1 acquisition comparing high risk individuals who are infected versus those who are not will more likely tease apart the biological risk mechanisms implicated in viral resilience from the behavioral risk factors. This could be studied in areas where the risk for HIV-1 is already relatively high in the general population (e.g. South Africa), and where viral entry and replication may represent more important components of acquisition than risk behaviors. Furthermore, although we validated our estimates of heritability and genetic correlations by using two independent methods, additional cohorts are needed to replicate our findings, including those obtained with the PRS analysis. Moreover, our genetic correlation analysis relies on self-report information from the UK Biobank, where individuals (aged 40+) are probably older than the average age of individuals diagnosed with HIV-1. Consequently, behaviors relevant to HIV-1 acquisition that may be more common in a younger cohort (e.g. drug use), could have been absent (or not reported) in the UK Biobank. Where we do find genetic correlations with HIV-1 risk, we cannot currently infer cause and effect, but this is something which may be achievable in the future via a Mendelian randomization design, once larger GWAS are able to detect robust genome-wide significant predictors of HIV-1 acquisition. Finally, the cytokine panel we investigated in association with PRS for acquisition was limited to 35 proteins, and it is possible that other inflammatory markers which we did not assess may be more relevant to this trait. To conclude, our results show that HIV-1 acquisition genetics impinges upon behavioral, cellular, and immune factors. By leveraging on modern population genetic methods, our work provides a novel framework to study HIV-1 acquisition as a complex phenotype, advancing our understanding of the underlying risk factors. Our results suggest that in addition to environmental risk factors, there is a polygenic component to HIV-1 acquisition that should be explored further in clinical studies. In addition, our work supports the investigation of future intervention strategies surrounding education and smoking behavior. In particular, there needs to be studies investigating whether smoking simply represents a proxy for unhealthy behaviors, or whether it actively influences biological processes linked to HIV-1 acquisition. Similarly, CCL17 and EFCAB14 should also be investigated with respect to their potential role as biomarkers for HIV-1 acquisition and as drug targets. As demonstrated here, GWAS can be very informative even when analyzing moderately sized cohorts, but its true potential to unveil the host genetic mechanisms influencing HIV-1 acquisition will likely only be unlocked with the creation of collaborative initiatives and analyses of larger cohorts. GWAS summary statistics. We obtained summary statistics from the largest HIV-1 acquisition GWAS meta-analysis to-date, performed by McLaren and colleagues, which analyzed 6,334 HIV-1-positive individuals and 7,247 HIV-1-negative population controls of European ancestry, collected in Europe, North America, Australia and Africa 10 . The HIV-1-positive group consisted of individuals who acquired HIV-1 by sexual contact (homosexual and heterosexual, N = 3,311), via the parenteral route (injection drug use and transfusion, N = 1,046), or by unknown means (N = 2,086) . The authors of this GWAS found no association of genotype with specific means of acquisition. We excluded variants not genotyped across all studies in the meta-analysis, those with a minor allele frequency <0.01, and those located within the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6, 26-34 Mb), due to its complex linkage disequilibrium structure. Heritability estimates and genetic correlations. We applied LD score regression in LD Hub v1.9.1 19 to estimate the heritability of HIV-1 acquisition and to identify genetically associated traits, based on 516 heritable Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:3304 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59256-0 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ phenotypes assessed in the UK Biobank 39 . The UK Biobank phenotypically characterized and genotyped 488,377 participants aged between 40-69 years, enabling LD Hub to test for genetic correlations between HIV-1 acquistion and traits of interest (e.g. disease states, behaviors and socioeconomic traits) 40 . Results were plotted in R 41 using the \"EnhancedVolcano\" library 42 . Estimation of SNP h 2 and genetic correlations were also performed using SumHer-GC, from the LDAK package 20 , with the genomic control feature enabled, to control for potential hidden population structure in the data, even though the authors of the original GWAS did not identify genomic inflation (see McLaren and colleagues (2013) 10 ). In the LDSC model, all SNPs are assumed to contribute equally to the phenotype, whereas in the LDAK model (which is expected to capture a larger proportion of heritability), a SNP with higher frequency is expected to contribute more towards heritability than one with lower frequency in the population, and a SNP in a region of low linkage disequilibrium contributes more than one in a region of high linkage disequilibrium. Gene-level and gene set enrichment analyses. We used the Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA) to identify genes and cell types associated with HIV-1 acquisition genetics, as described elsewhere 17, 18 . Briefly, gene-level statistics and weighted p-values were generated from GWAS summary statistics, adjusting gene-level associations for gene size, SNP density and LD. Input SNPs were mapped to 18,439 protein coding genes using a 10 kb upstream and downstream window, and a Bonferroni cut-off was applied to determine significance (P cut-off = 0.05/18,439 protein-coding genes = 2.71 × 10 −6 ) 19 . Next, the gene-set enrichment analysis used two single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets available in FUMA to identify cell types enriched for genes associated with HIV-1 acquisition under the false discovery rate of 10% (q < 0.10). Specifically, to identify particular tissues or organs involved in HIV-1 acquisition, we tested the transcriptional profile of 75 murine cell types (TabulaMuris_droplet_all) for enrichment with HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility genes. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of well-curated single cell transcriptome data from Mus musculus, containing information from 100,605 cells from 20 organs and tissues 43 . To identify specific neural populations that could drive the behaviors observed in the genetic correlations, we tested the transcriptional profile of 565 neuronal cell types (DropViz_all_level2) for enrichment with HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility genes. This dataset contains the transcriptional signature of 690,000 cells from the mouse brain, which have been previously used to investigate the cellular mechanisms of behavior 44 . the South east London community Health Study. We aimed to assess how HIV-1 acquisition risk might be moderated by an individual's immune profile prior to infection, and so we tested how polygenic risk for HIV-1 acquisition correlated with the expression of 35 inflammatory markers. We studied HIV-1-negative population controls from the South East London Community Health Study (SELCoH) [45] [46] [47] , where HIV-1-negative status was determined based on self-report. For further details on the full SELCoH study, please see Hatch et al. 43 . SELCoH aimed to investigate mental and physical health in the general population in London, UK. The subsample analyzed in our study consisted of 406 individuals for which both inflammatory and genetic data were available. The SELCoH study received approval from King's College London research ethics committee, reference PNM/12/13-152. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants at the time of sample collection. The 35 inflammatory markers represent adequately expressed cytokines from an initial panel of 42, which were originally assayed in relation to major depression risk, as described previously 48 . The mean age of our sample was 48.7 ± 15.1 (standard deviation), with a mean body mass index of 27.3 ± 5.5. The cohort is representative of the source population and consisted of 45.3% males; 20.9% current smokers and 40.4% ex-smokers; and 56.8% White British, 8.4% Black Caribbean, 10.9% Black African, 14.6% White Other, 6.2% Non-White Other, and 3.2% Mixed. Participants received detailed and repeated phenotypic assessments as part of three separate phases. The first phase aimed to assess common physical and mental disorders in South East London; the second, to examine the roles of historical social context and policy in shaping patterns of health inequalities; and the third, to collect biological specimens from a subset of participants, including blood for serum separation and DNA for genotyping. Serum and DNA were extracted and stored at −80 °C until use, as described previously 47,48 . Quantification and analysis of cytokines. Serum levels (pg/mL) of 35 blood-based markers were assessed in blood samples from the SELCoH cohort using multiplex ELISA-based technology provided by the Meso Scale Discovery Biomarker kits, as described previously 48 . For each marker, we adjusted for the effects of assay run, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking (never, current, former) and ethnicity, by taking standardized residuals (z-scores). Z-scores were then used in downstream PRS analyses. DnA genotyping. DNA samples from the SELCoH cohort were sent to the Affymetrix Research Services Laboratory in Santa Clara, California, USA. Genotyping was assayed using the UK Biobank Axiom Array (r3) which comprises of 820,967 genetic markers (Affymetrix, California, United States). Genotype data was put through quality control measures as described previously, and used to construct polygenic risk scores 47 . polygenic risk scores. Individualized polygenic risk scores (PRS) within the SELCoH sample were calculated using PRSice-2, a PRS quantification software 33, 34 . This pipeline uses summary statistics from a base GWAS to generate individualized PRS in a target dataset. Briefly, the number of risk alleles in the base dataset are multiplied by SNPs' effect sizes to generate individualized PRS in the target dataset. PRSice-2 clumps SNPs in the genotype files of the target dataset and removes those in high LD to avoid polygenic score inflation. For our initial screen, we constructed a PRS using all SNPs in the GWAS with P < 0.5. We tested whether this score predicted adjusted inflammatory marker levels in PRSice-2, covarying for seven population dimensions generated using principal component analysis applied to LD-pruned SNPs in PLINK 1.9 49 . Our relaxed p-value threshold (P T ) was initially selected based on earlier studies which revealed that highly polygenic phenotypes in moderately powered GWAS are better captured using a relaxed cut-off 50 .

         "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus and certain human respiratory viruses have been classified as coronaviruses (ALMEIDA et al., 1968) . The particles of IBV are 80--120 nm in diameter and contain a thread-like internal component 7--8 nm in cross-section (APoSTOLOV et al., 1970) . They differ markedly from myxoviruses in having an envelope derived from the cytoplasmic reticulmn instead of the cell membrane (B~o~: E~ et al., 1967) and club-like projections 15--20 nm in length, projecting from the envelope, which give to the virion its characteristic halo-or corona-like appearance (BERRY et al., 1964) . No outer spiky layer containing haemagglutinin or neuraminidase subunits has been demonstrated for the IBV virion (APosToLOV et al., 1970) . The nucleic acid of IBV has not been previously isolated but, from experiments with analogue inhibitors (CuN~I~GHAM, 1963) is generally considered to be RNA. Other enveloped RNA viruses of similar size such as influenza (D~rESBEI~G and ROBIS\"SO~, 1967) lymphocytic ehoriomeningitis (PEDERSON, 1970) and Rous sarcoma virus (BISHOP et al., 1970) , have been shown to contain several pieces of single-stranded RNA. The work reported here shows that the RNA of IBV is also fragmented, but the size distribution of the fragments differs from that of other groups. The following buffers were used: NET 0. Other reagents included deoxyribonuclease, pancreatic ribonuelease-A, (5• crystallised, Sigma), Biogel P-30 (Calbiochem) and diethyl pyroearbonate (Fluka). ]~ibonuclease-free sucrose (Sigma) was used in gradient preparations. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide (Eastman Organic) were purified according to LOENING (1967) , and prepared at 2.2 per cent and 0.15 per cent, respectively, in eleetrophoresis buffer. Polymerisation was accomplished with 0.2 per cent N-N-N'-N'tetramethylethylenediamine and 1 per cent ammonium persulphate. Phenol (Merck reagent grade) was twice distilled for I~NA extraction. Bentonite was prepared according to the method of F:RAENKEL-CoNI~AT et al. (1961) . Yeast carrier I~I~A (Sigma) was purified by two extractions with phenol/SDS at 37 ~ C (see below) followed by the addition of sodium acetate to 0.15 ~ and two volumes of ethanol. After 1 hour at --15 ~ C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in NET, reprecipitated and adjusted to 1000 izg/ml in NET for storage at --15 ~ C. Carrier-free 32p orthophosphate was obtained from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Lucas Heights, Sydney and 3I-I uridine (20--30 Ci/m Mole) from the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham U.K. 3It tobacco mosaic virus, aH poliovirus and aH (BHK cell) ribosomal I~NA were prepared by the method of TANNOCK et al. (1970) , using 3I-I uridine, unlabelled purified influenza strain BEL by that of TAYLoa et al. (1969) . All preparations were equilibrated with NET buffer by passing through Biogel P-30 columns prepared in NET before use. This was carried out using 2.2 per cent polyacrylamide gels, whose preparation is described above. Fractionation was according to the method of TANNOeK et al. (1970) . Thirty 8 day old chick embryos were each inoculated with 1 millicurie of 32p orthophosphate and, after 24 hours, with 103--104 EID~0 of the Victorian S vaccine strain of IBV (35th embryo passage) by the allantoic route. The IBV preparation was obtained from Dr. W. A. Geering of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne. Incubation was continued for a further 48 hours at 35 ~ C before the embryos were chilled and the allantoic fluid collected. This was accomplished by a modification of the method of BLAIR and DUESBERG (1970) which was used for purification of myxoviruses. Calf serum to 5 per cent was added to chilled allantoic fluid, followed by an equal volume of neutral saturated ammonium sulphate. The mixture was stirred at 0 ~ C for 30 minutes and the precipitate then collected by centrifugation at 2000g for 20 minutes and resuspended in approximately 25 mls of NET buffer. The virus was first concentrated by centrifuging onto a 2 ml 2.3 M sucrose cushion using a Spinco SW 25. I rotor for 35 minutes at 22,000 r. p. m. It was then partially purified by further centrifuging onto a similar 0.5 ml cushion through a 1.5 ml 15 per cent sucrose interface using a Spinco SW 40 rotor at 22,000 r.p.m, for 35 minutes. Final purification was achieved by the use of isopyenie centrifugation. Material from the interface was centrifuged either (A) through a 26.6 ml 15--65 per cent sucrose gradient in NET at 22,000 r. p. m. for 16 hours using a Spinco SW 25. i rotor or, (B) through an II ml 20--40 per cent potassium tartrate gradient for 2.5 hours at 35,000 r.p.m, using a Spinco SW40 rotor. Where sucrose gradients were used, fractions of 1.0 ml were collected from the bottom and the profiles for acid-insoluble radioactivity, density and infectivity are shown in Figure 1 A. Fraction 12 representing the peak of infectivity and radioactivity had a density, determined from its refractive index, of 1.176 g/cc. Fractions 8--19, representing tile common peak of radioactivity and infectivity were pooled for use in G . A . TA~'soeI~: R N A studies.

The gradients were p r e p a r e d in distilled water, N E T or p h o s p h a t e buffered saline, b u t on each occasion all virus in t h e suspension was deposited on the base of the tube as a fast sedimenting aggregate. I n f e c t i v i t y was d e t e r m i n e d either a) in eggs according to t h e capacity of ~BV to illduee s t u n t i n g , curling or d e a t h in infected 9 --1 0 day old chick e m b r y o s (ANON., 1963) or, b) from its capacity to inhibit ciliary activity (titres expressed as CIDs0/ml) in chicken embryo tracheal organ cultures (CHEaRY and TAYLOI~-I~oBI~SO~I, 1970). The latter procedure, while more reliable, had a sensitivity approximately one tenth that of the egg titration. The following procedure was used: Approximately 2--3 ml of purified 32p IBV in NET buffer was shaken for 10 minutes at 37 ~ C with an equal volume of phenol containing 1 per cent SDS and 0.1 per cent bentonite. After centrifugation for l0 minutes at 2000g, the upper aqueous phase was reraoved and the extraction procedure repeated. To the extract was added suitable marker or carrier I%NA's followed by two volumes of ethanol and sodium acetate to 0.15 ~. A precipitate was allowed to form at --15 ~ C for 1 hour and was collected by centrifuging at 10,000 r.p.m, for 10 minutes and was finally resuspended in either NET or electrophoresis buffer. An extract was obtained from a large batch of purified virus which had been purified in sucrose-density gradients from an initial volume of approximately 1 litre of infectious allantoie fluid. An ethanol precipitate was obtained from the extract, as described above, but without the addition of carrier or marker RNA. The precipitate was then collected and dissolved in 1 ml of NET buffer and its absorbance profile is shown in Figure 3 . Values of ODe~4/2s0 and 260/2s0 of 1.20 and 1.80, respectively, were obtained, which clearly indicates that the extracted material contained RNA.  This experiment was intended to confirm the genetic material of IBV as l~NA and to characterize it. I~NA was extracted from three IBV preparations purified in either sucrose (A and C) or potassium tartarate density gradients (B). In preparation A, the initial allantoic fluid was first treated with deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (each at 1 ~tg per ml) for 1 hour at 25 ~ C before purification. 3I-I ribosomal marker I%NA (0.2 m]) and 100 ~g of yeast carrier RIgA were added and total lgNA's from each were precipitated, as described above, and resuspended in 0.5 ml NET buffer. Each preparation was then centrifuged through pre-formed 4.8 ml 5--20 per cent sucrose gradients (A, B and C) prepared in NET for 60 (C) or 90 minutes (A and B) at 65,000 r.p.m, using a Spinco SW65 rotor. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected, placed onto paper strips and the acid-insoluble radioactivity present was determined. The profile for each gradient is shown in Figure 4 . As a Irrespective of the purification procedure used, the results indicate that the nucleic acid of IBV is extremely heterogeneous, being comprised of a range of species spread throughout the gradients. Because of its sensitivity to ribonuclease (C) and UV absorbance profile (Fig. 3) , the genetic material of IBV is undoubtedly P~NA and further confirmation is provided by its buoyant density in caesium sulphate (see Fig. 8 ). The pattern obtained for IBV RNA in sucrose gradients was then compared with one obtained after elcctrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. A mixture of 32p IBV RNA, aH ribosomal RNA and 100 ~g of yeast carrier RNA was prepared as described in the previous experiment. RNA was extracted from purified IBV and the final ethanol precipitate dissolved in 50 ~l of Loening's buffer. Electrophoresis of the preparation was carried out in 2.2 per cent polyacrylamide gels at 70 volts and 6 mA per tube for 1.25 (A) and 2.5 hours (B). The resulting electropherograms in Figure 5 again indicate considerable heterogeneity for IBV RNA. Two principal classes of I~NA appear to be present :  The absence of two distinct RNA classes in Figure 4 can be accounted for by the relatively poor resolving properties of sucrose gradients compared with polyaerylamide gels. In an additional two electropherograms (C and D) a similar distribution of RNA fragment sizes was apparent and figures obtained for the RNA classes are as follows : C, high molecular weight RNA fragment 75.6 per cent and low molecular weight RNA 15.8 per cent and D high molecular weight 85.4~ per cent and low molecular weight 9.1 per cent of total I~NA.  Discontinuity in the t~NA of IBV may have been caused by the activity of nucleases released during extraction, or by the breakage of a large RNA molecule at specific weak points. In an examination of these possibilities, the RNA profiles of IBV and either poliovirus or tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were compared after extraction together. Two rn~xtures consisting of 0.6 m~ of ~zp IBV and 0.6 ml of purified a) 3H poliovirus, or, b) 3I-I TMV were diluted to 3.0 ml with NET buffer. RNA was then extracted from each and precipitated with ethanol after the addition of 100 ~xg of yeast carrier RNA. Each RNA precipitate was suspended in 0.5 ml of NET and centrifuged through pre-formed 4.8 m] 5--20 per cent sucrose gradients, prepared in NET for 1 hour at 65,000 r. p. m. using a Spinco SW 65 rotor. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected and profiles for acid-insoluble radioactivity are shown in Figure 7 . They again suggest that IBV RNA is extremely heterogeneous being spread throughout the gradient as in Figure 4 . Both poliovirus and TMV RNA appear to be present as a single undegraded species, This suggests that the extraction method used does not release virion nucleases nor degrade IBV I~NA which, therefore, is presumably present within the virion as a discontinuous structure. The buoyant density of IBV RNA was compared with that of TMV I~NA. A mixture of both RNA's was prepared as described previously and, after ethanol precipitation, was suspended in 0.4 ml of NET buffer. The preparation was then layered onto 2.5 ml of a solution of caesium sulphate (density 1.64 g/ce) and centrifuged at 33,000 r.p.m, for 65 hours at 20 ~ C using a Spinco SW39 rotor. Fractions of 0.1 ml were collected and the density of each determined from its refractive index. Each fraction was then diluted to 0.4 ml with NET and an 0.2 ml volume placed onto a paper strip for the determination of acid-insoluble radioactivity. The remaining 0.2 ml of each Iraetion was treated with 1 ~g of ribonuelease for 1 hour at 25 ~ C and radioactivity remaining then estimated in the same manner. The results shown in Figure 8 , indicate that IBV RNA has a distribution in the equilibrium gradient identical with that of TMV RNA, having a peak at 1.65 g/cc, which is characteristic of other single-stranded RNA molecules (EI~IKSON and FRANKLIN, 1966) . This peak is greatly reduced in the presence of ribonuelease. The RNA of IBV differs from all these viruses in that the great proportion of its RIgA (74.9--85.4 per cent) consists of large, extremely heterogeneous fragments. Such an lgNA profile has been obtained from all freshly prepared IBV preparations examined and from one prepared from virus after 72 hours of allantoic growth. With fowl plague RNA, prepared from virus purified after differing times of growth, differences in the sizes and amounts of various RNA classes have been described and a similar heterogeneity noted (BARRY et al., 1970) . Heterogeneity in the high molecular weight RNA of IBV may reflect a degradative process, whereby a large molecule is broken down into smaller products, either mechanieMly at random weak points in the ribonucleoprotein component of the virion or through the action of nucleuses. However, the following evidence is adduced against the observed distribution for IBV I~NA being brought about in this manner: a) The size of high molecular weight RNA fragments is such that a precursor molecule of size greater than 1 • 107 daltons would be required. Such a molecule would be larger than any known RNA and seems unlikely to be present within a virion of diameter 80--120 nm having a buoyant density of 1.16--1.17 g/ec. b) No degradation was noted in the t~NA's of poliovirus or TMV after preparation in the presence of IBV ( Figure 6 ). c) No diminution in the degree of fragmentation of RNA was observed when a freshly purified IBV preparation was shaken for 30 minutes with 3 per cent diethyl pyrocarbonate, a potent inhibitor of nuelease activity (SoLYMOSu et al., 1968) prior to lgNA extraction. The low molecular weight I~NA of IBV has a molecular size comparable with that of cellular transfer I~NA (Fig. 5A ). Further knowledge of function would be provided by data on the base composition of each class IBV RNA and the degree of methylation of component bases. The high molecular weight RNA's of IBV are comparable in size with the major 57S RNA of NDV and the 70S (non-convalently linked) RNA of RSV (Dv~sBE~C~, 1968) and AMV (RoBIc~SOS and BALUDA, 1965), which are the largest known single-stranded RNA molecules. Messenger function for high molecular weight AMV RNA has been described by RIMA~ et al. (1967) , whereas that for NDV is known to be associated not with the major 57 S I%NA component, but with shorter complementary negative strands (B~ATT and ROBINSON, 1967) . Whether high molecular weight I~NA or complementary strands act as the intraeellular messengers for IBV cannot be determined from the present study. It has been recently reported by HIER~IOLZnR et al. (1972) that at least 6 polypeptides are present within the virion of the related human coronavirus OC43, having molecular weights of 191,000, 104,000, 60,000, 47,000, 30,000 and 15,000 daltons. Occasionally, a seventh polypeptide with a molecular weight of 165,000 was also present. If values of 118.0 and 346.0 are assigned for the average molecular weights of individual amino acids and nucleotides, respectively, then an I~NA molecule of molecular weight 3.92 • 106 daltons would be required to encode the genetic information for the first six polypeptides. If the seventh is also included, then the figure is 5.37 • 106 daltons. I~NA fragments of this size range are dearly present within High Molecular Weight IBV RNA (Fig. 5 ). The pattern of IBV RNA fragment sizes, as revealed by analysis in sucrose density gradients or polyacrylamide gels, suggests that considerable heterogeneity in the I~NA content of individual virions must be present. Were the particles homogeneous, representatives of each fragment size would have to be present and the total RNA complement for each virion would be well in excess of 20 • 10 s daltons, which seems unlikely for a virion of the size and buoyant density of IBV. Differences in the size of individual virions, which are apparent in Figure 2 , are a characteristic of coronaviruses (AL~EIDA et al., 1968). Such differences may reflect differences in the I~NA content of individual particles whose buoyant densities may, in consequence, be relatively similar. Heterogeneity in particle buoyant densities is apparent after purification in sucrose-density gradients (Fig. 1A) . However, much better resolution was afforded by the use of potassium tartrate gradients (Fig. t B) and similar differences have been noted by BISHOP et al. (1970) for the purification of RSV, whose I~NA's are more uniform in size than those of RSV. I thank Miss Beverly Smyth and Mrs. Glenyse Harmer for competent technical assistance.",
         "The nucleic acid of infectious bronchitis virus. The nucleic acid of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), like that of other enveloped viruses, consists of discontinuous single stranded RNA. However, unlike many other viruses, there is extreme heterogeneity in the sizes of the RNA fragments, as revealed by centrifugation in sucrose gradients or electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. Two principal classes of RNA fragments are present: a. A larger class comprising 74.9–85.4 per cent of total RNA and consisting of fragments having molecular weights ranging from 0.5×10(6) to considerably greater than 3.0×10(6) daltons and, b. A smaller class comprising 9.1–19.7 per cent of total RNA with the size approximately that of ribosomal 4S RNA. All IBV RNA's were fully susceptible to ribonuclease and had a buoyant density in caesium sulphate identical to that of tobacco mosaic virus RNA. No difference in the RNA profile for IBV was observed from the use of different methods of virus purification. The single-stranded RNA's of poliovirus and tobacco mosaic virus remained undegraded after preparation in the presence of IBV.. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus and certain human respiratory viruses have been classified as coronaviruses (ALMEIDA et al., 1968) .

Other reagents included deoxyribonuclease, pancreatic ribonuelease-A, (5• crystallised, Sigma), Biogel P-30 (Calbiochem) and diethyl pyroearbonate (Fluka). ]~ibonuclease-free sucrose (Sigma) was used in gradient preparations. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide (Eastman Organic) were purified according to LOENING (1967) , and prepared at 2.2 per cent and 0.15 per cent, respectively, in eleetrophoresis buffer. Polymerisation was accomplished with 0.2 per cent N-N-N'-N'tetramethylethylenediamine and 1 per cent ammonium persulphate. Phenol (Merck reagent grade) was twice distilled for I~NA extraction. Bentonite was prepared according to the method of F:RAENKEL-CoNI~AT et al. (1961) . Yeast carrier I~I~A (Sigma) was purified by two extractions with phenol/SDS at 37 ~ C (see below) followed by the addition of sodium acetate to 0.15 ~ and two volumes of ethanol. After 1 hour at --15 ~ C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in NET, reprecipitated and adjusted to 1000 izg/ml in NET for storage at --15 ~ C. Carrier-free 32p orthophosphate was obtained from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Lucas Heights, Sydney and 3I-I uridine (20--30 Ci/m Mole) from the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham U.K. 3It tobacco mosaic virus, aH poliovirus and aH (BHK cell) ribosomal I~NA were prepared by the method of TANNOCK et al. (1970) , using 3I-I uridine, unlabelled purified influenza strain BEL by that of TAYLoa et al. (1969) . All preparations were equilibrated with NET buffer by passing through Biogel P-30 columns prepared in NET before use. This was carried out using 2.2 per cent polyacrylamide gels, whose preparation is described above. Fractionation was according to the method of TANNOeK et al. (1970) . Thirty 8 day old chick embryos were each inoculated with 1 millicurie of 32p orthophosphate and, after 24 hours, with 103--104 EID~0 of the Victorian S vaccine strain of IBV (35th embryo passage) by the allantoic route. The IBV preparation was obtained from Dr. W. A. Geering of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne. Incubation was continued for a further 48 hours at 35 ~ C before the embryos were chilled and the allantoic fluid collected. This was accomplished by a modification of the method of BLAIR and DUESBERG (1970) which was used for purification of myxoviruses. Calf serum to 5 per cent was added to chilled allantoic fluid, followed by an equal volume of neutral saturated ammonium sulphate. The mixture was stirred at 0 ~ C for 30 minutes and the precipitate then collected by centrifugation at 2000g for 20 minutes and resuspended in approximately 25 mls of NET buffer. The virus was first concentrated by centrifuging onto a 2 ml 2.3 M sucrose cushion using a Spinco SW 25. I rotor for 35 minutes at 22,000 r. p. m. It was then partially purified by further centrifuging onto a similar 0.5 ml cushion through a 1.5 ml 15 per cent sucrose interface using a Spinco SW 40 rotor at 22,000 r.p.m, for 35 minutes. Final purification was achieved by the use of isopyenie centrifugation. Material from the interface was centrifuged either (A) through a 26.6 ml 15--65 per cent sucrose gradient in NET at 22,000 r. p. m. for 16 hours using a Spinco SW 25. i rotor or, (B) through an II ml 20--40 per cent potassium tartrate gradient for 2.5 hours at 35,000 r.p.m, using a Spinco SW40 rotor. Where sucrose gradients were used, fractions of 1.0 ml were collected from the bottom and the profiles for acid-insoluble radioactivity, density and infectivity are shown in Figure 1 A. Fraction 12 representing the peak of infectivity and radioactivity had a density, determined from its refractive index, of 1.176 g/cc. Fractions 8--19, representing tile common peak of radioactivity and infectivity were pooled for use in G . A . TA~'soeI~: R N A studies. Virus a p p e a r e d as a flocculent b a n d a n d sucrose was r e m o v e d b y passing t h e pooled fractions t h r o u g h a Biogel P-30 column equilibrated w i t h N E T .

Several unsuccessful a t t e m p t s were m a d e to f u r t h e r purify I B V b y velocity gradient, eentrifugation.

The gradients were p r e p a r e d in distilled water, N E T or p h o s p h a t e buffered saline, b u t on each occasion all virus in t h e suspension was deposited on the base of the tube as a fast sedimenting aggregate. I n f e c t i v i t y was d e t e r m i n e d either a) in eggs according to t h e capacity of ~BV to illduee s t u n t i n g , curling or d e a t h in infected 9 --1 0 day old chick e m b r y o s (ANON., 1963) or, b) from its capacity to inhibit ciliary activity (titres expressed as CIDs0/ml) in chicken embryo tracheal organ cultures (CHEaRY and TAYLOI~-I~oBI~SO~I, 1970). The latter procedure, while more reliable, had a sensitivity approximately one tenth that of the egg titration. The following procedure was used: Approximately 2--3 ml of purified 32p IBV in NET buffer was shaken for 10 minutes at 37 ~ C with an equal volume of phenol containing 1 per cent SDS and 0.1 per cent bentonite. After centrifugation for l0 minutes at 2000g, the upper aqueous phase was reraoved and the extraction procedure repeated. To the extract was added suitable marker or carrier I%NA's followed by two volumes of ethanol and sodium acetate to 0.15 ~. A precipitate was allowed to form at --15 ~ C for 1 hour and was collected by centrifuging at 10,000 r.p.m, for 10 minutes and was finally resuspended in either NET or electrophoresis buffer. An extract was obtained from a large batch of purified virus which had been purified in sucrose-density gradients from an initial volume of approximately 1 litre of infectious allantoie fluid. An ethanol precipitate was obtained from the extract, as described above, but without the addition of carrier or marker RNA. The precipitate was then collected and dissolved in 1 ml of NET buffer and its absorbance profile is shown in Figure 3 . Values of ODe~4/2s0 and 260/2s0 of 1.20 and 1.80, respectively, were obtained, which clearly indicates that the extracted material contained RNA.  This experiment was intended to confirm the genetic material of IBV as l~NA and to characterize it. I~NA was extracted from three IBV preparations purified in either sucrose (A and C) or potassium tartarate density gradients (B). In preparation A, the initial allantoic fluid was first treated with deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (each at 1 ~tg per ml) for 1 hour at 25 ~ C before purification. 3I-I ribosomal marker I%NA (0.2 m]) and 100 ~g of yeast carrier RIgA were added and total lgNA's from each were precipitated, as described above, and resuspended in 0.5 ml NET buffer. Each preparation was then centrifuged through pre-formed 4.8 ml 5--20 per cent sucrose gradients (A, B and C) prepared in NET for 60 (C) or 90 minutes (A and B) at 65,000 r.p.m, using a Spinco SW65 rotor. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected, placed onto paper strips and the acid-insoluble radioactivity present was determined. The profile for each gradient is shown in Figure 4 . As a Irrespective of the purification procedure used, the results indicate that the nucleic acid of IBV is extremely heterogeneous, being comprised of a range of species spread throughout the gradients. Because of its sensitivity to ribonuclease (C) and UV absorbance profile (Fig. 3) , the genetic material of IBV is undoubtedly P~NA and further confirmation is provided by its buoyant density in caesium sulphate (see Fig. 8 ). The pattern obtained for IBV RNA in sucrose gradients was then compared with one obtained after elcctrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. A mixture of 32p IBV RNA, aH ribosomal RNA and 100 ~g of yeast carrier RNA was prepared as described in the previous experiment. RNA was extracted from purified IBV and the final ethanol precipitate dissolved in 50 ~l of Loening's buffer. Electrophoresis of the preparation was carried out in 2.2 per cent polyacrylamide gels at 70 volts and 6 mA per tube for 1.25 (A) and 2.5 hours (B). The resulting electropherograms in Figure 5 again indicate considerable heterogeneity for IBV RNA. Two principal classes of I~NA appear to be present :  The absence of two distinct RNA classes in Figure 4 can be accounted for by the relatively poor resolving properties of sucrose gradients compared with polyaerylamide gels. In an additional two electropherograms (C and D) a similar distribution of RNA fragment sizes was apparent and figures obtained for the RNA classes are as follows : C, high molecular weight RNA fragment 75.6 per cent and low molecular weight RNA 15.8 per cent and D high molecular weight 85.4~ per cent and low molecular weight 9.1 per cent of total I~NA.  Discontinuity in the t~NA of IBV may have been caused by the activity of nucleases released during extraction, or by the breakage of a large RNA molecule at specific weak points. In an examination of these possibilities, the RNA profiles of IBV and either poliovirus or tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were compared after extraction together. Two rn~xtures consisting of 0.6 m~ of ~zp IBV and 0.6 ml of purified a) 3H poliovirus, or, b) 3I-I TMV were diluted to 3.0 ml with NET buffer. RNA was then extracted from each and precipitated with ethanol after the addition of 100 ~xg of yeast carrier RNA. Each RNA precipitate was suspended in 0.5 ml of NET and centrifuged through pre-formed 4.8 m] 5--20 per cent sucrose gradients, prepared in NET for 1 hour at 65,000 r. p. m. using a Spinco SW 65 rotor. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected and profiles for acid-insoluble radioactivity are shown in Figure 7 . They again suggest that IBV RNA is extremely heterogeneous being spread throughout the gradient as in Figure 4 . Both poliovirus and TMV RNA appear to be present as a single undegraded species, This suggests that the extraction method used does not release virion nucleases nor degrade IBV I~NA which, therefore, is presumably present within the virion as a discontinuous structure. The buoyant density of IBV RNA was compared with that of TMV I~NA. A mixture of both RNA's was prepared as described previously and, after ethanol precipitation, was suspended in 0.4 ml of NET buffer. The preparation was then layered onto 2.5 ml of a solution of caesium sulphate (density 1.64 g/ce) and centrifuged at 33,000 r.p.m, for 65 hours at 20 ~ C using a Spinco SW39 rotor. Fractions of 0.1 ml were collected and the density of each determined from its refractive index. Each fraction was then diluted to 0.4 ml with NET and an 0.2 ml volume placed onto a paper strip for the determination of acid-insoluble radioactivity. The remaining 0.2 ml of each Iraetion was treated with 1 ~g of ribonuelease for 1 hour at 25 ~ C and radioactivity remaining then estimated in the same manner. The results shown in Figure 8 , indicate that IBV RNA has a distribution in the equilibrium gradient identical with that of TMV RNA, having a peak at 1.65 g/cc, which is characteristic of other single-stranded RNA molecules (EI~IKSON and FRANKLIN, 1966) . This peak is greatly reduced in the presence of ribonuelease. The RNA of IBV differs from all these viruses in that the great proportion of its RIgA (74.9--85.4 per cent) consists of large, extremely heterogeneous fragments. Such an lgNA profile has been obtained from all freshly prepared IBV preparations examined and from one prepared from virus after 72 hours of allantoic growth. With fowl plague RNA, prepared from virus purified after differing times of growth, differences in the sizes and amounts of various RNA classes have been described and a similar heterogeneity noted (BARRY et al., 1970) . Heterogeneity in the high molecular weight RNA of IBV may reflect a degradative process, whereby a large molecule is broken down into smaller products, either mechanieMly at random weak points in the ribonucleoprotein component of the virion or through the action of nucleuses. However, the following evidence is adduced against the observed distribution for IBV I~NA being brought about in this manner: a) The size of high molecular weight RNA fragments is such that a precursor molecule of size greater than 1 • 107 daltons would be required. Such a molecule would be larger than any known RNA and seems unlikely to be present within a virion of diameter 80--120 nm having a buoyant density of 1.16--1.17 g/ec. b) No degradation was noted in the t~NA's of poliovirus or TMV after preparation in the presence of IBV ( Figure 6 ). c) No diminution in the degree of fragmentation of RNA was observed when a freshly purified IBV preparation was shaken for 30 minutes with 3 per cent diethyl pyrocarbonate, a potent inhibitor of nuelease activity (SoLYMOSu et al., 1968) prior to lgNA extraction. The low molecular weight I~NA of IBV has a molecular size comparable with that of cellular transfer I~NA (Fig. 5A ). Further knowledge of function would be provided by data on the base composition of each class IBV RNA and the degree of methylation of component bases. The high molecular weight RNA's of IBV are comparable in size with the major 57S RNA of NDV and the 70S (non-convalently linked) RNA of RSV (Dv~sBE~C~, 1968) and AMV (RoBIc~SOS and BALUDA, 1965), which are the largest known single-stranded RNA molecules. Messenger function for high molecular weight AMV RNA has been described by RIMA~ et al. (1967) , whereas that for NDV is known to be associated not with the major 57 S I%NA component, but with shorter complementary negative strands (B~ATT and ROBINSON, 1967) . Whether high molecular weight I~NA or complementary strands act as the intraeellular messengers for IBV cannot be determined from the present study. It has been recently reported by HIER~IOLZnR et al. (1972) that at least 6 polypeptides are present within the virion of the related human coronavirus OC43, having molecular weights of 191,000, 104,000, 60,000, 47,000, 30,000 and 15,000 daltons. Occasionally, a seventh polypeptide with a molecular weight of 165,000 was also present. If values of 118.0 and 346.0 are assigned for the average molecular weights of individual amino acids and nucleotides, respectively, then an I~NA molecule of molecular weight 3.92 • 106 daltons would be required to encode the genetic information for the first six polypeptides. If the seventh is also included, then the figure is 5.37 • 106 daltons. I~NA fragments of this size range are dearly present within High Molecular Weight IBV RNA (Fig. 5 ). The pattern of IBV RNA fragment sizes, as revealed by analysis in sucrose density gradients or polyacrylamide gels, suggests that considerable heterogeneity in the I~NA content of individual virions must be present. Were the particles homogeneous, representatives of each fragment size would have to be present and the total RNA complement for each virion would be well in excess of 20 • 10 s daltons, which seems unlikely for a virion of the size and buoyant density of IBV. Differences in the size of individual virions, which are apparent in Figure 2 , are a characteristic of coronaviruses (AL~EIDA et al., 1968). Such differences may reflect differences in the I~NA content of individual particles whose buoyant densities may, in consequence, be relatively similar. Heterogeneity in particle buoyant densities is apparent after purification in sucrose-density gradients (Fig. 1A) . However, much better resolution was afforded by the use of potassium tartrate gradients (Fig. t B) and similar differences have been noted by BISHOP et al. (1970) for the purification of RSV, whose I~NA's are more uniform in size than those of RSV. I thank Miss Beverly Smyth and Mrs. Glenyse Harmer for competent technical assistance.",

         "Probable reassortment of genomic elements among elongated RNA-containing plant viruses",
         "The relationships of genome organization among elongated (rod-shaped and filamentous) plant viruses have been analyzed. Sequences in coding and noncoding regions of barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) RNAs 1, 2, and 3 were compared with those of the monopartite RNA genomes of potato virus X (PVX), white clover mosaic virus (WClMV), and tobacco mosaic virus, the bipartite genome of tobacco rattle virus (TRV), the quadripartite genome of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), and icosahedral tricornaviruses. These plant viruses belong to a supergroup having 5′-capped genomic RNAs. The results suggest that the genomic elements in each BSMV RNA are phylogenetically related to those of different plant RNA viruses. RNA 1 resembles the corresponding RNA 1 of tricornaviruses. The putative proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 2 are related to the products of BNYVV RNA 2, PVX RNA, and WClMV RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that BSMV RNA 3 resembles TRV RNA 1. Also, it can be proposed that in the case of monopartite genomes, as a rule, every gene or block of genes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA. Such differential evolution of individual elements of one and the same viral genome implies a prominent role for gene reassortment in the formation of viral genetic systems.",

         "Sequencing of the genomes of RNA-containing viruses has offered a wealth of data for comparing amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode. Regions of similarity have been found among virusspecific proteins of viruses heretofore held to be quite remote, such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV, a tobamovirus), brome mosaic virus (BMV, a bromovirus), alfalfa mosaic virus (A1MV, an ilarvirus), and Sindbis virus (an alphavirus) (Cornelissen and Bol 1984; Haseloff et al. 1984; Kamer and Argos 1984) . It has been proposed that these and related viruses be classified in one supergroup (Goldbach 1986 ). The second supergroup comprises plant como-, poty-, and nepoviruses and animal picornaviruses that also show extensive similarity in the amino acid sequences of a number of proteins and similar gene arrangements Franssen et al. 1984; Allison et al. 1986; Goldbach 1986; Meyer et al. 1986; Domier et al. 1987) . The most distinguishing structural feature of the genomic RNA supergroups is that the 5' end carries a cap in the first supergroup but a covalently linked protein in the second one. The genome of any virus is a combination of coding sequences (genes) and noncoding regulatory sequences. The data available allow us to estimate the minimal number of functions (genes) essential for replication of (+)RNA plant viruses (in different viruses they can occur in different combinations): (1) a block of genes (usually not less than two) ensuring synthesis of virus-specific RNAs; (2) gene(s) responsible for the cell-to-cell transport of viral genetic material over the infected plant; and (3) one or more genes coding for the virus coat. Viruses whose RNA is translated into a polyprotein must also have gene(s) for processing protease(s). It is just this minimal set that is present in the TMV genome: genes for the 126-kd and 183-kd proteins involved in RNA replication, for the 30kd \"transport\" protein, and for the coat protein (for review see Palukaitis and Zaitlin 1986). Functionally analogous genes are distributed among the three genomic components of bromo-, cucumo-, and ilarviruses (Symons 1985) . The bipartite tobacco rattle virus (TRV, a tobravirus) possesses an additional gene coding for a cysteine-rich 16-kd protein of unknown function (Cornelissen et al. 1986 ). The quadripartite beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV, a furovirus) encodes no protein similar to the transport proteins of the above-mentioned viruses, but BNYVV RNA 2 contains additional open reading frames (ORFs) discussed below (Bouzoubaa et al. 1987; Lemaire et al. 1988) . The main objects of our analysis are two viruses whose genome structure has been studied for quite a few years by our group in cooperation with the groups of K.G. Skryabin and Y.V. Kozlov. These are barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), a type member of the hordeivirus group, and potato virus X (PVX), a type member of the potexvirus group. Our aim was to compare the genome organization of hordei-and potexviruses with that of some other plant RNA viruses. Amino Acid Sequence Data. Amino acid sequence data were taken from the following papers: BSMV RNA 1 ); BSMV RNA 2 (Gustafson and Armour 1986); BSMV RNA 3 Gustafson et al. 1987) ; BNYVV RNA 1 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1987) ; BNYVV RNA 2 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ); TMV (Goelet et al. 1982) ; TRV (Cornelissen et al. 1986; Hamilton et al. 1987) ; tobamoviral coat proteins (Altschuh et al. 1987) ; PVX (Morozov et al. t 987; Krayev et al. 1988 ); WCtMV (Forster et al. 1988 ); TYMV (Morch et al. 1988 ). Sequence Alignments. Initial similarity searches of the viral noncoat proteins were made with the matrix comparison program DIAGON (Staden 1982) run on a Wicat-S computer. The scoring system for this comparison was based on the observed frequency of substitution of one amino acid for another in a number of protein families (Schwartz and Dayhoff 1978) . Groups of amino acids were: A, S, T, P, and G; N, D, E, and Q; H, R, and K; M, L, I, and V; F, Y, and W. Detailed alignments were made by visual inspection. Hydrophilicity Prediction. The sequences of the small noncoat proteins were analyzed for hydrophilicity using the method described by Hopp and Woods (1981) . The averaged hydrophilicity values for heptapeptides from n -3 to n + 3 (n > 4) were plotted against n. The prediction of membrane-bound properties of proreins was made by the methods of Eisenberg et al. (1984) and Mohana Rao and Argos (1986) . Construction of Phylogenetic Trees. Conserved sequences of putative RNA polymerases shown in Fig. 6A were aligned with those of other (+)RNA-containing viruses according to Koonin et al. (1988) . A similarity matrix depending on the pairwise alignment of sequences was calculated using the Dayhoff exchange weights (Schwartz and Dayhoff 1978; Koonin et al. 1988 ). All possible subtrees for four-point conditions were constructed by using the similarity matrix. The final rootless phylogenetic tree consists of the subtrees combined optimally according to the maximum topological similarity principle Yushmanov and Chumakov 1988) . Filamentous potexviruses have a monopartite 5'capped (Sonenberg et al. 1978 ) and 3'-polyadenylated (Morozov et al. 1981 ) genome whose internal genes are expressed through formation of subgenomic RNAs (Guilford and Forster 1986; Dolja et al. 1987) . By now the PVX and WC1MV genomes have been completely sequenced Forster et al. 1988; Krayev et al. 1988) . Hordeiviruses are the only group of rod-shaped viruses with tripartite genome (for review see Atabekov and Dolja 1986) . BSMV RNAs 2 and 3 and a part of RNA 1 have already been sequenced Gustafson and Armour 1986; Rupasov et al. 1986; Gustafson et al. 1987) . Together with bromo-, cucumo-, and ilarviruses, BSMV may be considered formally a tricornavirus. There are indeed certain similarities among the four groups. BSMV RNAs are capped and, like those ofbromoand cucumoviruses (but unlike those of ilarviruses, for review see Haenni et al. 1982) , carry a 3'-terminal tyrosine-accepting tRNA-like structure Kozlov et al. 1984) . BSMV RNA 1, like RNA 1 of tricornaviruses, codes for one large protein (Dolja et al. 1983b; ). This 120-kd protein of BSMV exhibits similarity (at least in the C-terminal region) with domain 1C of the RNA-replicating 109-kd protein of BMV (Quadt et al. 1988) , with related proteins of other tricornaviruses, tobamoviruses, tobraviruses, and, to a lesser extent, potexviruses and furoviruses (Cornelissen and Bol 1984; Rupasov et al. 1986; Hamilton et al. 1987; Forster et al. 1988; Krayev et al. 1988) (Fig. 1 ). All these proteins belong to the first family of the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins related to the bacterial DNA-helicases (Gorbalenya et al. 1988a,b; Hodgman 1988) . However, BSMV differs markedly from tricornaviruses in the number and arrangement of other genomic elements. All BSMV RNAs contain an internal poly(A) tract (Agranovsky et al. 1982 ) directly following the UAA terminator codon of 3'-terminal genes (Gustafson and Armour 1986; Rupasov et al. 1986 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ), the 25-kd protein of PVX (Krayev et al. 1988) , the 26-kd protein of WCIMV (Forster et al. 1988) , and the 58-kd protein of BSMV (Gustafson and Armour 1986) with the putative proteins involved in replication of BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1987) , PVX (Krayev et al. 1988 ), WC1MV (Forster et al. 1988 ), BSMV ), BMV (Symons 1985) , TMV (Palukaitis and Zaitlin 1986), and TRV (Hamilton et al. 1987 ). Positions where putative replicases have conserved similarities (Schwartz and Dayhoff 1978) with two or more sequences from the four top lines (including 42-kd BNYVV, 25-kd PVX, 26-kd WC1MV, 58-kd BSMV) are boxed. The amino acid sequence pattern similar to purine nucleotide-binding protein consensus is marked by a dashed overline. Numerals show the numbers of amino acid residues that could not be aligned. Gaps (-) have been introduced in the sequences for maximum alignment. The number in front of the sequences gives the position of its first amino acid in the protein. there it is localized in the intercistronic region (Ahlquist et al. 1981) . On the other hand, in the array of genes, BSMV RNA 2 resembles RNA 2 of BNYVV. As can be seen in Fig. 2 , both RNAs have the coat protein genes at the 5' termini--a situation rare enough among plant viruses. In BNYVV this is followed by five other ORFs (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 (Bouzoubaa et al. , 1987 and in BSMV by three (Gustafson and Armour 1986) 9 Comparison of amino acid sequences of the hypothetical proteins encoded therein shows that the possible products of BSMV RNA 2 have obvious, albeit variable, similarity with those of BNYVV RNA 2. Thus, the 14-kd and 17-kd proteins encoded in overlapping ORFs in the 3'-terminal region of BSMV RNA 2 have some properties of membranebound proteins as do also the 13-kd and 15-kd pro-  RNA helicases. Consequently, two NTP-binding proteins are encoded in the genomes of BSMV, BNYVV, PVX, and WC1MV. Thus, the genomes of three elongated plant viruses belonging to different groups (hordei-, furo-, and potexviruses) turn out to contain a similar block of three genes (Fig. 2) , two of which probably code for membrane-bound proteins and the third for a predicted NTP-binding protein. Gustafson and Armour 1986) , and PVX RNA (Krayev et al. 1988 ). Counterparts are marked by identical shading. teins of BNYVV ). These two pairs are similar in the relative location of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid blocks (see Fig.  3 ). An analogous pair of proteins containing membrane-bound segments is encoded in overlapping ORFs (13 kd and 8 kd) of PVX. Moreover, BSMV 14-kd, BNYVV 13-kd, and PVX 13-kd proteins all carry a conserved amino acid block. This hydrophilic block separates two hydrophobic domains (Fig.  3) . The pairs of genes described are preceded by sequences coding for a 58-kd protein in BSMV RNA 2 (Gustafson and Armour 1986), a 42-kd protein in BNYVV RNA 2 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 (Bouzoubaa et al. , 1987 , and a 25-kd protein in PVX RNA (Fig. 2) . As is evident from Fig. 1 , these three proteins contain similar amino acid sequences. These sequences also display relation with the conserved domains of a family of predicted NTP-binding proteins of (+)RNA-containing plant viruses (Gorbalenya et al. 1985 (Gorbalenya et al. , 1988a Dever et al. 1987) . As suggested by Gorbalenya et al. (1988a) , the above-mentioned proteins are the diverged relatives of the polypeptide domains encoded in the same genomic RNA of potexviruses (165-kd PVX and 147-kd WCIMV proteins), RNA 1 of BSMV (120-kd protein), and BNYVV (237-kd protein) (Figs. 1 and 2) . Recently, Gorbalenya et al. (1988c) and Hodgman (1988) have shown that these viral proteins (belonging to the first family of NTPmotif-containing proteins) display a pronounced sequence similarity with the bacterial DNA helicases. It was speculated that these viral proteins may be involved in unwinding of double-stranded replicalive forms during genomic RNA replication. In this case, predicted NTP-binding proteins encoded by the triple gene block could represent the subunits of Analysis of the amino acid sequences coded for by the 5'-terminal coat protein genes of BSMV and BNYVV reveals common motifs (Fig. 4) . Similar motifs are found in the coat proteins of three other rod-shaped viruses: TMV, sunhemp mosaic virus (SHMV, a tobamovirus), and TRV. Interestingly, the corresponding genes in these latter viruses are located at the 3' end of TMV RNA (Fig. 5) and SHMV RNA (Meshi et al. 1981; Palukaitis and Zaitlin 1986 ) and on a separate nucleic acid, RNA 2, of TRV (Harrison and Robinson 1986) . The amino acid sequence of the PVX coat protein bears no appreciable similarity with those of BSMV, BNYVV, TMV, or TRV; it shows, however, obvious similarity with the coat protein sequences of a number of filamentous potyviruses . It should be emphasized that despite similar particle morphology, potyviruses and potexviruses belong to different supergroups of RNA-conraining viruses (see Introduction). In potyviruses the genome structure and mode of its expression are quite distinct from those of PVX, BSMV, or BNYVV (Allison et al. 1986; Domier et al. 1987 ). The dicistronic RNA 3 of BSMV has yet no direct analogy among plant viruses in the number and arrangement of genes. Nevertheless, the proteins it codes for exhibit significant similarity with two out of four proteins encoded in RNA 1 of the bipartite TRV. Among putative polymerases of the plant Sindbis-like viruses (Goldbach 1986; Koonin et al. 1988) , BSMV RNA polymerase, whose gene is located in the 5'-proximal part of RNA 3 Gustafson et al. 1987) , shows the greatest similarity with the putative TRV polymerase (the C-terminal region of the 194-kd protein encoded in RNA 1) (see Figs. 5 and 6A). This conclusion is confirmed illustratively by a phylogenetic rootless tree constructed using the aligned amino acid sequences shown in Fig. 6A and the sequences of other putative viral RNA polymerases (Fig. 6B) . This dendrogram representing phylogenetic relationships 4 . Comparison of the best-conserved amino acid sequences within the coat proteins of tobamoviruses (TMV, SHMV), TRV, BSMV, and BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986; Cornelissen et al. 1986; Gustafson and Armour 1986; Altschuh et al. 1987 ). The number in front of a sequence block gives the position within the protein of the first amino acid of this block. Residues predicted to be involved in the intrasubunit salt bridge (see Altschuh et al. 1987 ) are indicated by asterisks. Positions where two or more sequences have conserved similarities as given by Schwartz and Dayhoff ( 1978) are indicated by boxes. Cornelissen et al, 1986; Hamilton et al. 1987) , and BSMV RNA 3 Gustafson et al. 1987) . Proteins containing similarities are marked by identical shading. among the proteins of the capped supergroup RNA plant viruses was created in accordance with the maximum topological similarity principle of Yushmanov and . It is important to note that similarity between polymerase proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 3 and BNYVV RNA 1 is much less pronounced (Fig. 6) in spite of the clear relations in gene organization and the sequences of a number of other proteins between these viruses (see above). The deduced phylogenetic tree revealed a significant divergence of the potexviruses from the other capped plant RNA viruses (Fig. 6B) . Surprisingly, comparison of the PVX putative polymerase domain and the corresponding region of the 206-kd protein of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV--a type member of spherical tymoviruses) whose RNA sequence was recently determined (Morch et al. 1988) leads to the conclusion that these viral polymerase proteins are quite closely related (Fig. 6) . Thus, the gene coding for the putative RNA polymerase in the potexvirus and the tymovirus monopartite genomes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA because PVX and TYMV capsid proteins are unrelated and the above-mentioned conserved triple block of genes is not found in the TYMV genome. The 17-kd protein encoded in the 3'-terminal region of BSMV RNA 3 (Dolja et al. 1983a; Gustafson et al. 1987 ) resembles the 16kd protein ofTRV (Cornelissen et al. 1986 ) as well as the 14-kd protein of BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ): all these proteins contain 6-8% cysteine residues dispersed along the polypeptide chain. The hypothetical cysteine-rich proteins of the three viruses are encoded in the 3'-terminal regions of different genomic RNAs: TRY RNA 1, BNYVV RNA 2, and BSMV RNA 3. Comparative analyses of the cysteine-rich protein sequences reveal obvious relationships between these proteins and the proteins having metal-binding nucleic acid-binding domains (Fig. 7) . The metal-binding \"fingers\" involve two cysteines separated by 5-25 residues from a brace of closely spaced histidines and/or cysteines (K_lug and Rhodes 1987) (Fig. 7) . However, the identification of the above-mentioned proteins as metalbinding proteins is rather questionable with respect to the recent experimentally based conclusion of Freedman et al. (1988) : \"Certainly the mere presence of appropriately placed cysteins or histidines should not suffice to identify zinc finger proteins.\" Between the 194-kd and 16-kd protein genes of TRV there is a gene for a 29-kd protein similar to the 30-kd transport protein ofTMV (Boccara et al. 1986 ) (see Fig. 5 ). Such entities are lacking in the BNYVV, WC1MV, PVX, and, possibly, BSMV genomes. In these cases the transport function can supposedly be performed by one or more of the above-mentioned triple block of proteins that are in the three viruses (see Fig. 2 ). To sum up, kindred genomic elements can be found in diverse and quite remote groups of plant viruses. Taking BSMV as a reference, for its tyrosine-accepting tRNA-like structure the related genomic elements are bromo-and cucumoviruses; for the conserved domains 1C and 2 of the putative RNA polymerases they are tobra-and tobamoviruses; for the triple gene block in RNA 2 they are furo-and potexviruses; for the coat-protein gene they are furo-, tobamo-, and tobraviruses. On the other hand, the PVX coat protein is akin to the potyvirus coat proteins. The last observation suggests that the different genes of the monopartite PVX genome are related to the genomic elements of dissimilar plant viruses, as is the case for the multipartite BSMV genome. Recently, Mitler et al. (1988) have sequenced the monopartite RNA genome of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV--a type member of the spherical luteoviruses). The BYDV genome unexpectedly was found to code for the 50-kd protein similar to the BNYVV 54-kd protein--the read-through product of the coat protein gene (see Fig. 2 ). The other protein of BYDV (60kd) displays considerable similarity with the putative RNA polymerase of carnation mottle virus (CarMV) (Miller et al. 1988 ). However, the genome strategy of BYDV and the sequences of 8SMV  TRV  TMV  8NYVV  PVX  UCINV  TYMV   BSMV  TRV  TMV  BNYVV  PVX  MCIMV  TYMV   BSMV  TRV  THV  BNYVV Koonin et al. (1987) . Parameters of tree and matrices: mean square of relative distance deviation is 0.00200789; sum of distance deviation modes is 2.052; sum of differential neighbor matrix elements is 70; topologic mismatch is 5.45455%. Position of BNYVV in the tree fluctuates somewhat (local topological deviation is 16 for BNYVV and for other viruses it is 3-9). other putative proteins differ significantly from those of the rodlike multipartite BNYVV and the spherical monopartite CarMV. Thus, BYDV represents one more virus whose monopartite genome consists of a mosaic of genetic elements having independent phylogenetic relationships. Much the same situation has been reported for animal viruses. Similarity has been found in the Fig. 7 . Amino acid sequence similarity within the cysteine-rich 16-kd protein of TRV (Cornelissen et al. 1986) , the 17-kd protein of BSMV Gustafson et al. 1987 ) and the 14-kd protein of BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ). The conservative cysteine and histidine residues are boxed. Gaps (-) indicate nonconserved spacing between conserved positions. The numbers within and in front of the sequence blocks are defined in Fig. 1. three-dimensional structure and in the amino acid sequences of the coat proteins of the members of picorna-and alphaviruses (Fuller and Argos 1987 )-groups markedly differing in genome structure and mode of expression and belonging to different supergroups of RNA-containing viruses. Similar resuits were obtained upon comparison of the coat proteins of picornaviruses and small spherical (+)RNA-containing plant viruses (Rossmann 1987) . Thus, every gene (or sometimes a block of genes) or noncoding regulatory genomic element (e.g., the tRNA-like structure) connotes its own scheme of evolutionary relations. This complicates elaboration of a universal system of (+)RNA-containing viruses reflecting their actual evolutionary links. Such a system can be envisaged no longer as a tree but rather as a more intricate structure, a kind of threedimensional network. It is only natural to suggest that such involved patterns may result from real processes of exchange and reassortment of genetic information among viruses. Recent studies also facilitate perception of the mechanism of this reassortment: it is recombination at the RNA level, most likely through copy-choice during replication. Such recombination has been determined for at least three groups of (+)RNA-containing viruses: picorna- (Kirkegaard and Baltimore 1986; Romanova et al. 1986 ), corona- (Makino et al. 1986) , and bromoviruses (Bujarsky and Kaesberg 1986). Especially demonstrative is the last example, describing an exchange of tRNA-like structures between different genomic RNAs or BMV. It is tempting to think that recombination under natural conditions also gave rise to the RNA of SHMV whose coding body carries the same genes as in other tobamoviruses, whereas the tRNA-like structure is similar to that of tymoviruses (Meshi et al. 1981) . Findings of duplications and a deletion in the putative BSMV RNA polymerase gene (Dolja et al. 1983b; Afanasiev et al. 1986; Gustafson et al. 1987) indirectly point to the existence of a process involving copy-choice in this virus as well. Such events may produce new BSMV strains both in nature and under experimental conditions (Atabekov and Dolja 1986). The peculiar 3'-terminal tandem in BSMV RNAs 1-3 could itself have arisen from recombination between an RNA carrying a 3'-terminal tRNA-like structure (as in bromoviruses) and an RNA carrying a 3'-terminal poly(A) tail (as in PVX or BNYVV). It can be supposed that the genome of RNAcontaining viruses is composed of discrete units that may differ in size from several dozen (noncoding regulatory sequences) to several thousand nucleotides (blocks of genes). The unit size may itself be determined by its function. At the same time, the location and environment of each unit may vary greatly. Assuming that formation of viral RNA genomes involved reassortment of their elements, we come to the next question of what host cells exist wherein these genomes could meet. At present the answer can be speculative only. The two versions that seem the most plausible are: (1) viruses and host diverged concurrently, i.e., the common ancestors of their contemporary viruses infected the common ancestors of their contemporary hosts; (2) the host specificity of viruses and/or the specific susceptibility of their hosts is a later development than was the formation (establishment) of the viral RNA genome. There appear to be some uncertainties in the interpretation of these phenomena. As suggested by Matthews (1985) : (1) \"... the genomes of viruses with RNA involved in part or all of the genomic life cycle may consist of a mixture of highly conserved genes and genes with no base sequence homology due to the rapid rate of mutation in RNA. 9 (2) \"Quite unrelated viruses that evolved independently might have developed amino acid homologies in those parts of the protein constrained to interact with some highly conserved host macromolecule or viral process for which there is only one structural solution.\" There is another plausible cause of similarity among genomic elements of distantly related viruses, which is capture of similar sequences from the host cell. Although for coding viral sequences the examples are still scarce (except for retroviruses) and not always convincing, alleged acquisition of a poly(A) tail or a tRNA-like structure in just this manner could hardly be disputed. Entrapment and covalent attachment of cell tRNA has been described for Sindbis virus DI RNA (Monroe and Schlesinger 1983). It is noteworthy that both animal and plant cell genomes (Sakamoto and Okada 1985; Benslimane et al. 1986 ) contain numerous transcribed sequences encoding not only tRNAs but also tRNA-like structures. The exchange of information between cell and viral RNAs through a copy-choice mechanism may be facilitated by the presence of endogenous RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in animal (Volloch 1986 ) and plant cells (Fraenkel-Conrat 1983) . By and large, analysis of genome structure of a number of elongated (+)RNA-containing plant viruses strongly supports the suggestion that shuffling of genomic elements among different viruses has occurred. As far as we know, such an idea was first mentioned by Haseloff et al. (1984) . There are a number of convincing examples in favor ofreassortment between the genomes of RNAcontaining viruses differing in particle structure and mode ofgenome replication and expression. Recent findings that the products of cauliflower mosaic virus genes I and II are somewhat related to the proteins of several RNA-containing plant viruses (Hull et al. 1986; Domier et al. 1987) bring the DNAcontaining retroid viruses into the field of play as well. At least one example of amino acid sequence similarity exists between the coat proteins of singlestranded DNA-containing and RNA-containing viruses (Mohana Rao 1986). Thus, the overall impression is that among viruses the shuffling of genetic elements is rather a universal phenomenon.",
         "Probable reassortment of genomic elements among elongated RNA-containing plant viruses. The relationships of genome organization among elongated (rod-shaped and filamentous) plant viruses have been analyzed. Sequences in coding and noncoding regions of barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) RNAs 1, 2, and 3 were compared with those of the monopartite RNA genomes of potato virus X (PVX), white clover mosaic virus (WClMV), and tobacco mosaic virus, the bipartite genome of tobacco rattle virus (TRV), the quadripartite genome of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), and icosahedral tricornaviruses. These plant viruses belong to a supergroup having 5′-capped genomic RNAs. The results suggest that the genomic elements in each BSMV RNA are phylogenetically related to those of different plant RNA viruses. RNA 1 resembles the corresponding RNA 1 of tricornaviruses. The putative proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 2 are related to the products of BNYVV RNA 2, PVX RNA, and WClMV RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that BSMV RNA 3 resembles TRV RNA 1. Also, it can be proposed that in the case of monopartite genomes, as a rule, every gene or block of genes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA. Such differential evolution of individual elements of one and the same viral genome implies a prominent role for gene reassortment in the formation of viral genetic systems.. Sequencing of the genomes of RNA-containing viruses has offered a wealth of data for comparing amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode. Regions of similarity have been found among virusspecific proteins of viruses heretofore held to be quite remote, such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV, a tobamovirus), brome mosaic virus (BMV, a bromovirus), alfalfa mosaic virus (A1MV, an ilarvirus), and Sindbis virus (an alphavirus) (Cornelissen and Bol 1984; Haseloff et al. 1984; Kamer and Argos 1984) . It has been proposed that these and related viruses be classified in one supergroup (Goldbach 1986 ). The second supergroup comprises plant como-, poty-, and nepoviruses and animal picornaviruses that also show extensive similarity in the amino acid sequences of a number of proteins and similar gene arrangements Franssen et al. 1984; Allison et al. 1986; Goldbach 1986; Meyer et al. 1986; Domier et al. 1987) . The most distinguishing structural feature of the genomic RNA supergroups is that the 5' end carries a cap in the first supergroup but a covalently linked protein in the second one. The genome of any virus is a combination of coding sequences (genes) and noncoding regulatory sequences. The data available allow us to estimate the minimal number of functions (genes) essential for replication of (+)RNA plant viruses (in different viruses they can occur in different combinations): (1) a block of genes (usually not less than two) ensuring synthesis of virus-specific RNAs; (2) gene(s) responsible for the cell-to-cell transport of viral genetic material over the infected plant; and (3) one or more genes coding for the virus coat. Viruses whose RNA is translated into a polyprotein must also have gene(s) for processing protease(s). It is just this minimal set that is present in the TMV genome: genes for the 126-kd and 183-kd proteins involved in RNA replication, for the 30kd \"transport\" protein, and for the coat protein (for review see Palukaitis and Zaitlin 1986). Functionally analogous genes are distributed among the three genomic components of bromo-, cucumo-, and ilarviruses (Symons 1985) . The bipartite tobacco rattle virus (TRV, a tobravirus) possesses an additional gene coding for a cysteine-rich 16-kd protein of unknown function (Cornelissen et al. 1986 ). The quadripartite beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV, a furovirus) encodes no protein similar to the transport proteins of the above-mentioned viruses, but BNYVV RNA 2 contains additional open reading frames (ORFs) discussed below (Bouzoubaa et al. 1987; Lemaire et al. 1988) . The main objects of our analysis are two viruses whose genome structure has been studied for quite a few years by our group in cooperation with the groups of K.G. Skryabin and Y.V. Kozlov. These are barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), a type member of the hordeivirus group, and potato virus X (PVX), a type member of the potexvirus group. Our aim was to compare the genome organization of hordei-and potexviruses with that of some other plant RNA viruses. Amino Acid Sequence Data. Amino acid sequence data were taken from the following papers: BSMV RNA 1 ); BSMV RNA 2 (Gustafson and Armour 1986); BSMV RNA 3 Gustafson et al. 1987) ; BNYVV RNA 1 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1987) ; BNYVV RNA 2 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ); TMV (Goelet et al. 1982) ; TRV (Cornelissen et al. 1986; Hamilton et al. 1987) ; tobamoviral coat proteins (Altschuh et al. 1987) ; PVX (Morozov et al. t 987; Krayev et al. 1988 ); WCtMV (Forster et al. 1988 ); TYMV (Morch et al. 1988 ). Sequence Alignments. Initial similarity searches of the viral noncoat proteins were made with the matrix comparison program DIAGON (Staden 1982) run on a Wicat-S computer. The scoring system for this comparison was based on the observed frequency of substitution of one amino acid for another in a number of protein families (Schwartz and Dayhoff 1978) . Groups of amino acids were: A, S, T, P, and G; N, D, E, and Q; H, R, and K; M, L, I, and V; F, Y, and W. Detailed alignments were made by visual inspection. Hydrophilicity Prediction. The sequences of the small noncoat proteins were analyzed for hydrophilicity using the method described by Hopp and Woods (1981) . The averaged hydrophilicity values for heptapeptides from n -3 to n + 3 (n > 4) were plotted against n. The prediction of membrane-bound properties of proreins was made by the methods of Eisenberg et al. (1984) and Mohana Rao and Argos (1986) . Construction of Phylogenetic Trees. Conserved sequences of putative RNA polymerases shown in Fig. 6A were aligned with those of other (+)RNA-containing viruses according to Koonin et al. (1988) . A similarity matrix depending on the pairwise alignment of sequences was calculated using the Dayhoff exchange weights (Schwartz and Dayhoff 1978; Koonin et al. 1988 ). All possible subtrees for four-point conditions were constructed by using the similarity matrix. The final rootless phylogenetic tree consists of the subtrees combined optimally according to the maximum topological similarity principle Yushmanov and Chumakov 1988) . Filamentous potexviruses have a monopartite 5'capped (Sonenberg et al. 1978 ) and 3'-polyadenylated (Morozov et al. 1981 ) genome whose internal genes are expressed through formation of subgenomic RNAs (Guilford and Forster 1986; Dolja et al. 1987) . By now the PVX and WC1MV genomes have been completely sequenced Forster et al. 1988; Krayev et al. 1988) . Hordeiviruses are the only group of rod-shaped viruses with tripartite genome (for review see Atabekov and Dolja 1986) . BSMV RNAs 2 and 3 and a part of RNA 1 have already been sequenced Gustafson and Armour 1986; Rupasov et al. 1986; Gustafson et al. 1987) . Together with bromo-, cucumo-, and ilarviruses, BSMV may be considered formally a tricornavirus. There are indeed certain similarities among the four groups. BSMV RNAs are capped and, like those ofbromoand cucumoviruses (but unlike those of ilarviruses, for review see Haenni et al. 1982) , carry a 3'-terminal tyrosine-accepting tRNA-like structure Kozlov et al. 1984) . BSMV RNA 1, like RNA 1 of tricornaviruses, codes for one large protein (Dolja et al. 1983b; ). This 120-kd protein of BSMV exhibits similarity (at least in the C-terminal region) with domain 1C of the RNA-replicating 109-kd protein of BMV (Quadt et al. 1988) , with related proteins of other tricornaviruses, tobamoviruses, tobraviruses, and, to a lesser extent, potexviruses and furoviruses (Cornelissen and Bol 1984; Rupasov et al. 1986; Hamilton et al. 1987; Forster et al. 1988; Krayev et al. 1988) (Fig. 1 ). All these proteins belong to the first family of the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins related to the bacterial DNA-helicases (Gorbalenya et al. 1988a,b; Hodgman 1988) . However, BSMV differs markedly from tricornaviruses in the number and arrangement of other genomic elements. All BSMV RNAs contain an internal poly(A) tract (Agranovsky et al. 1982 ) directly following the UAA terminator codon of 3'-terminal genes (Gustafson and Armour 1986; Rupasov et al. 1986 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ), the 25-kd protein of PVX (Krayev et al. 1988) , the 26-kd protein of WCIMV (Forster et al. 1988) , and the 58-kd protein of BSMV (Gustafson and Armour 1986) with the putative proteins involved in replication of BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1987) , PVX (Krayev et al. 1988 ), WC1MV (Forster et al. 1988 ), BSMV ), BMV (Symons 1985) , TMV (Palukaitis and Zaitlin 1986), and TRV (Hamilton et al. 1987 ). Positions where putative replicases have conserved similarities (Schwartz and Dayhoff 1978) with two or more sequences from the four top lines (including 42-kd BNYVV, 25-kd PVX, 26-kd WC1MV, 58-kd BSMV) are boxed. The amino acid sequence pattern similar to purine nucleotide-binding protein consensus is marked by a dashed overline. Numerals show the numbers of amino acid residues that could not be aligned. Gaps (-) have been introduced in the sequences for maximum alignment. The number in front of the sequences gives the position of its first amino acid in the protein. there it is localized in the intercistronic region (Ahlquist et al. 1981) . On the other hand, in the array of genes, BSMV RNA 2 resembles RNA 2 of BNYVV. As can be seen in Fig. 2 , both RNAs have the coat protein genes at the 5' termini--a situation rare enough among plant viruses. In BNYVV this is followed by five other ORFs (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 (Bouzoubaa et al. , 1987 and in BSMV by three (Gustafson and Armour 1986) 9 Comparison of amino acid sequences of the hypothetical proteins encoded therein shows that the possible products of BSMV RNA 2 have obvious, albeit variable, similarity with those of BNYVV RNA 2. Thus, the 14-kd and 17-kd proteins encoded in overlapping ORFs in the 3'-terminal region of BSMV RNA 2 have some properties of membranebound proteins as do also the 13-kd and 15-kd pro-  RNA helicases. Consequently, two NTP-binding proteins are encoded in the genomes of BSMV, BNYVV, PVX, and WC1MV. Thus, the genomes of three elongated plant viruses belonging to different groups (hordei-, furo-, and potexviruses) turn out to contain a similar block of three genes (Fig. 2) , two of which probably code for membrane-bound proteins and the third for a predicted NTP-binding protein. Gustafson and Armour 1986) , and PVX RNA (Krayev et al. 1988 ). Counterparts are marked by identical shading. teins of BNYVV ). These two pairs are similar in the relative location of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid blocks (see Fig.  3 ). An analogous pair of proteins containing membrane-bound segments is encoded in overlapping ORFs (13 kd and 8 kd) of PVX. Moreover, BSMV 14-kd, BNYVV 13-kd, and PVX 13-kd proteins all carry a conserved amino acid block. This hydrophilic block separates two hydrophobic domains (Fig.  3) . The pairs of genes described are preceded by sequences coding for a 58-kd protein in BSMV RNA 2 (Gustafson and Armour 1986), a 42-kd protein in BNYVV RNA 2 (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 (Bouzoubaa et al. , 1987 , and a 25-kd protein in PVX RNA (Fig. 2) . As is evident from Fig. 1 , these three proteins contain similar amino acid sequences. These sequences also display relation with the conserved domains of a family of predicted NTP-binding proteins of (+)RNA-containing plant viruses (Gorbalenya et al. 1985 (Gorbalenya et al. , 1988a Dever et al. 1987) . As suggested by Gorbalenya et al. (1988a) , the above-mentioned proteins are the diverged relatives of the polypeptide domains encoded in the same genomic RNA of potexviruses (165-kd PVX and 147-kd WCIMV proteins), RNA 1 of BSMV (120-kd protein), and BNYVV (237-kd protein) (Figs. 1 and 2) . Recently, Gorbalenya et al. (1988c) and Hodgman (1988) have shown that these viral proteins (belonging to the first family of NTPmotif-containing proteins) display a pronounced sequence similarity with the bacterial DNA helicases. It was speculated that these viral proteins may be involved in unwinding of double-stranded replicalive forms during genomic RNA replication. In this case, predicted NTP-binding proteins encoded by the triple gene block could represent the subunits of Analysis of the amino acid sequences coded for by the 5'-terminal coat protein genes of BSMV and BNYVV reveals common motifs (Fig. 4) . Similar motifs are found in the coat proteins of three other rod-shaped viruses: TMV, sunhemp mosaic virus (SHMV, a tobamovirus), and TRV. Interestingly, the corresponding genes in these latter viruses are located at the 3' end of TMV RNA (Fig. 5) and SHMV RNA (Meshi et al. 1981; Palukaitis and Zaitlin 1986 ) and on a separate nucleic acid, RNA 2, of TRV (Harrison and Robinson 1986) . The amino acid sequence of the PVX coat protein bears no appreciable similarity with those of BSMV, BNYVV, TMV, or TRV; it shows, however, obvious similarity with the coat protein sequences of a number of filamentous potyviruses . It should be emphasized that despite similar particle morphology, potyviruses and potexviruses belong to different supergroups of RNA-conraining viruses (see Introduction). In potyviruses the genome structure and mode of its expression are quite distinct from those of PVX, BSMV, or BNYVV (Allison et al. 1986; Domier et al. 1987 ). The dicistronic RNA 3 of BSMV has yet no direct analogy among plant viruses in the number and arrangement of genes. Nevertheless, the proteins it codes for exhibit significant similarity with two out of four proteins encoded in RNA 1 of the bipartite TRV. Among putative polymerases of the plant Sindbis-like viruses (Goldbach 1986; Koonin et al. 1988) , BSMV RNA polymerase, whose gene is located in the 5'-proximal part of RNA 3 Gustafson et al. 1987) , shows the greatest similarity with the putative TRV polymerase (the C-terminal region of the 194-kd protein encoded in RNA 1) (see Figs. 5 and 6A). This conclusion is confirmed illustratively by a phylogenetic rootless tree constructed using the aligned amino acid sequences shown in Fig. 6A and the sequences of other putative viral RNA polymerases (Fig. 6B) . This dendrogram representing phylogenetic relationships 4 . Comparison of the best-conserved amino acid sequences within the coat proteins of tobamoviruses (TMV, SHMV), TRV, BSMV, and BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986; Cornelissen et al. 1986; Gustafson and Armour 1986; Altschuh et al. 1987 ). The number in front of a sequence block gives the position within the protein of the first amino acid of this block. Residues predicted to be involved in the intrasubunit salt bridge (see Altschuh et al. 1987 ) are indicated by asterisks. Positions where two or more sequences have conserved similarities as given by Schwartz and Dayhoff ( 1978) are indicated by boxes. Cornelissen et al, 1986; Hamilton et al. 1987) , and BSMV RNA 3 Gustafson et al. 1987) . Proteins containing similarities are marked by identical shading. among the proteins of the capped supergroup RNA plant viruses was created in accordance with the maximum topological similarity principle of Yushmanov and . It is important to note that similarity between polymerase proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 3 and BNYVV RNA 1 is much less pronounced (Fig. 6) in spite of the clear relations in gene organization and the sequences of a number of other proteins between these viruses (see above). The deduced phylogenetic tree revealed a significant divergence of the potexviruses from the other capped plant RNA viruses (Fig. 6B) . Surprisingly, comparison of the PVX putative polymerase domain and the corresponding region of the 206-kd protein of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV--a type member of spherical tymoviruses) whose RNA sequence was recently determined (Morch et al. 1988) leads to the conclusion that these viral polymerase proteins are quite closely related (Fig. 6) . Thus, the gene coding for the putative RNA polymerase in the potexvirus and the tymovirus monopartite genomes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA because PVX and TYMV capsid proteins are unrelated and the above-mentioned conserved triple block of genes is not found in the TYMV genome. The 17-kd protein encoded in the 3'-terminal region of BSMV RNA 3 (Dolja et al. 1983a; Gustafson et al. 1987 ) resembles the 16kd protein ofTRV (Cornelissen et al. 1986 ) as well as the 14-kd protein of BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ): all these proteins contain 6-8% cysteine residues dispersed along the polypeptide chain. The hypothetical cysteine-rich proteins of the three viruses are encoded in the 3'-terminal regions of different genomic RNAs: TRY RNA 1, BNYVV RNA 2, and BSMV RNA 3. Comparative analyses of the cysteine-rich protein sequences reveal obvious relationships between these proteins and the proteins having metal-binding nucleic acid-binding domains (Fig. 7) . The metal-binding \"fingers\" involve two cysteines separated by 5-25 residues from a brace of closely spaced histidines and/or cysteines (K_lug and Rhodes 1987) (Fig. 7) . However, the identification of the above-mentioned proteins as metalbinding proteins is rather questionable with respect to the recent experimentally based conclusion of Freedman et al. (1988) : \"Certainly the mere presence of appropriately placed cysteins or histidines should not suffice to identify zinc finger proteins.\" Between the 194-kd and 16-kd protein genes of TRV there is a gene for a 29-kd protein similar to the 30-kd transport protein ofTMV (Boccara et al. 1986 ) (see Fig. 5 ). Such entities are lacking in the BNYVV, WC1MV, PVX, and, possibly, BSMV genomes. In these cases the transport function can supposedly be performed by one or more of the above-mentioned triple block of proteins that are in the three viruses (see Fig. 2 ). To sum up, kindred genomic elements can be found in diverse and quite remote groups of plant viruses. Taking BSMV as a reference, for its tyrosine-accepting tRNA-like structure the related genomic elements are bromo-and cucumoviruses; for the conserved domains 1C and 2 of the putative RNA polymerases they are tobra-and tobamoviruses; for the triple gene block in RNA 2 they are furo-and potexviruses; for the coat-protein gene they are furo-, tobamo-, and tobraviruses. On the other hand, the PVX coat protein is akin to the potyvirus coat proteins. The last observation suggests that the different genes of the monopartite PVX genome are related to the genomic elements of dissimilar plant viruses, as is the case for the multipartite BSMV genome. Recently, Mitler et al. (1988) have sequenced the monopartite RNA genome of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV--a type member of the spherical luteoviruses). The BYDV genome unexpectedly was found to code for the 50-kd protein similar to the BNYVV 54-kd protein--the read-through product of the coat protein gene (see Fig. 2 ). The other protein of BYDV (60kd) displays considerable similarity with the putative RNA polymerase of carnation mottle virus (CarMV) (Miller et al. 1988 ). However, the genome strategy of BYDV and the sequences of 8SMV  TRV  TMV  8NYVV  PVX  UCINV  TYMV   BSMV  TRV  TMV  BNYVV  PVX  MCIMV  TYMV   BSMV  TRV  THV  BNYVV Koonin et al. (1987) . Parameters of tree and matrices: mean square of relative distance deviation is 0.00200789; sum of distance deviation modes is 2.052; sum of differential neighbor matrix elements is 70; topologic mismatch is 5.45455%. Position of BNYVV in the tree fluctuates somewhat (local topological deviation is 16 for BNYVV and for other viruses it is 3-9). other putative proteins differ significantly from those of the rodlike multipartite BNYVV and the spherical monopartite CarMV. Thus, BYDV represents one more virus whose monopartite genome consists of a mosaic of genetic elements having independent phylogenetic relationships. Much the same situation has been reported for animal viruses. Similarity has been found in the Fig. 7 . Amino acid sequence similarity within the cysteine-rich 16-kd protein of TRV (Cornelissen et al. 1986) , the 17-kd protein of BSMV Gustafson et al. 1987 ) and the 14-kd protein of BNYVV (Bouzoubaa et al. 1986 ). The conservative cysteine and histidine residues are boxed. Gaps (-) indicate nonconserved spacing between conserved positions. The numbers within and in front of the sequence blocks are defined in Fig. 1. three-dimensional structure and in the amino acid sequences of the coat proteins of the members of picorna-and alphaviruses (Fuller and Argos 1987 )-groups markedly differing in genome structure and mode of expression and belonging to different supergroups of RNA-containing viruses. Similar resuits were obtained upon comparison of the coat proteins of picornaviruses and small spherical (+)RNA-containing plant viruses (Rossmann 1987) . Thus, every gene (or sometimes a block of genes) or noncoding regulatory genomic element (e.g., the tRNA-like structure) connotes its own scheme of evolutionary relations. This complicates elaboration of a universal system of (+)RNA-containing viruses reflecting their actual evolutionary links. Such a system can be envisaged no longer as a tree but rather as a more intricate structure, a kind of threedimensional network. It is only natural to suggest that such involved patterns may result from real processes of exchange and reassortment of genetic information among viruses. Recent studies also facilitate perception of the mechanism of this reassortment: it is recombination at the RNA level, most likely through copy-choice during replication. Such recombination has been determined for at least three groups of (+)RNA-containing viruses: picorna- (Kirkegaard and Baltimore 1986; Romanova et al. 1986 ), corona- (Makino et al. 1986) , and bromoviruses (Bujarsky and Kaesberg 1986). Especially demonstrative is the last example, describing an exchange of tRNA-like structures between different genomic RNAs or BMV. It is tempting to think that recombination under natural conditions also gave rise to the RNA of SHMV whose coding body carries the same genes as in other tobamoviruses, whereas the tRNA-like structure is similar to that of tymoviruses (Meshi et al. 1981) . Findings of duplications and a deletion in the putative BSMV RNA polymerase gene (Dolja et al. 1983b; Afanasiev et al. 1986; Gustafson et al. 1987) indirectly point to the existence of a process involving copy-choice in this virus as well. Such events may produce new BSMV strains both in nature and under experimental conditions (Atabekov and Dolja 1986). The peculiar 3'-terminal tandem in BSMV RNAs 1-3 could itself have arisen from recombination between an RNA carrying a 3'-terminal tRNA-like structure (as in bromoviruses) and an RNA carrying a 3'-terminal poly(A) tail (as in PVX or BNYVV). It can be supposed that the genome of RNAcontaining viruses is composed of discrete units that may differ in size from several dozen (noncoding regulatory sequences) to several thousand nucleotides (blocks of genes). The unit size may itself be determined by its function. At the same time, the location and environment of each unit may vary greatly. Assuming that formation of viral RNA genomes involved reassortment of their elements, we come to the next question of what host cells exist wherein these genomes could meet. At present the answer can be speculative only. The two versions that seem the most plausible are: (1) viruses and host diverged concurrently, i.e., the common ancestors of their contemporary viruses infected the common ancestors of their contemporary hosts; (2) the host specificity of viruses and/or the specific susceptibility of their hosts is a later development than was the formation (establishment) of the viral RNA genome. There appear to be some uncertainties in the interpretation of these phenomena. As suggested by Matthews (1985) : (1) \"... the genomes of viruses with RNA involved in part or all of the genomic life cycle may consist of a mixture of highly conserved genes and genes with no base sequence homology due to the rapid rate of mutation in RNA. 9 (2) \"Quite unrelated viruses that evolved independently might have developed amino acid homologies in those parts of the protein constrained to interact with some highly conserved host macromolecule or viral process for which there is only one structural solution.\" There is another plausible cause of similarity among genomic elements of distantly related viruses, which is capture of similar sequences from the host cell. Although for coding viral sequences the examples are still scarce (except for retroviruses) and not always convincing, alleged acquisition of a poly(A) tail or a tRNA-like structure in just this manner could hardly be disputed. Entrapment and covalent attachment of cell tRNA has been described for Sindbis virus DI RNA (Monroe and Schlesinger 1983). It is noteworthy that both animal and plant cell genomes (Sakamoto and Okada 1985; Benslimane et al. 1986 ) contain numerous transcribed sequences encoding not only tRNAs but also tRNA-like structures. The exchange of information between cell and viral RNAs through a copy-choice mechanism may be facilitated by the presence of endogenous RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in animal (Volloch 1986 ) and plant cells (Fraenkel-Conrat 1983) . By and large, analysis of genome structure of a number of elongated (+)RNA-containing plant viruses strongly supports the suggestion that shuffling of genomic elements among different viruses has occurred. As far as we know, such an idea was first mentioned by Haseloff et al. (1984) . There are a number of convincing examples in favor ofreassortment between the genomes of RNAcontaining viruses differing in particle structure and mode ofgenome replication and expression. Recent findings that the products of cauliflower mosaic virus genes I and II are somewhat related to the proteins of several RNA-containing plant viruses (Hull et al. 1986; Domier et al. 1987) bring the DNAcontaining retroid viruses into the field of play as well. At least one example of amino acid sequence similarity exists between the coat proteins of singlestranded DNA-containing and RNA-containing viruses (Mohana Rao 1986). Thus, the overall impression is that among viruses the shuffling of genetic elements is rather a universal phenomenon.",

         "Relative bioavailability of nicotine from a nasal spray in infectious rhinitis and after use of a topical decongestant",
         "The relative bioavailability of nicotine from a nasal spray was assessed in 15 smokers suffering a common cold and rhinitis according to generally accepted criteria. The patients were given a single dose of 2 mg nicotine from the nasal spray with and without concurrent administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor decongestant, xylometazoline, in randomised order. Control session measurements were made in the disease-free state. Applying strict bioequivalence criteria, we found that common cold/rhinitis slightly reduced the bioavailability of nicotine, both in its rate and extent; the geometric mean of the ratio of C(max), AUC and t(max) were 0.81, 0.93 and 1.36, respectively. The nasal vasoconstrictor, xylometazoline, normalised the extent of the bioavailability of nicotine, but further prolonged the time for absorption to almost twice that measured in the disease-free state, increasing the t(max) ratio to 1.72. The results suggest that a minor proportion of people stopping smoking with the help of a nicotine nasal spray may experience a minor reduction in the effect of the spray during common cold/rhinitis. However, the nicotine self-titration behaviour found with most smoking cessation products (except the nicotine patch) will automatically lead to an adjustment of the dosage to achieve the desired effect.",

         "The nasal cavity is lined with a large area of well vascularized mucosa, which permits the rapid absorption of a number of drugs. Intranasal administration is being explored as an alternative route for drug administration [1] . The development of a nicotine nasal spray primarily stems from experimental work showing rapid absorption of nicotine from nasal snuff [2] . In fact, the plasma nicotine profile after use of a nasal spray is closer to that seen with smoking than any other form of nicotine replacement [3, 4, 5] . For obvious reasons, diseases affecting the nasal mucosa, e.g. inflammatory diseases with nasal obstruction and discharge, may interfere with the absorption of nicotine administered in the nose. A further complicating factor is the possible treatment of these symptoms with a locally administered vasoconstrictor. As this situation will be faced by many patients using a nicotine nasal spray, it was important to determine the extent to which rhinitis and the concurrent administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor decongestant might affect the bioavailability of intranasal nicotine. The study had an open, three-way cross-over design. The bioavailability of nicotine from the nasal spray was assessed with and without concurrent treatment with a vasoconstrictor during a confirmed attack of rhinitis and the results were compared with the disease-free state. The sequence between the rhinitis sessions was randomised. The session when the subject was disease-free was performed as soon as possible after the episode of rhinitis. Fifteen healthy smokers, 20 to 40 years of age, participated in the study. They had no history of alcohol abuse or drug dependence. The subjects had to abstain from nicotine for at least 12 h prior to the drug administration and throughout the entire experimental session. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Lund and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All subjects gave their written consent prior to the start of the study. A nicotine nasal spray (Nicorette ® 10 rag. m1-1) and a nasal spray containing the vasoconstrictor xylometazoline (Otrivin e 1 mg. m! 1) were used. Each spray delivered a solution containing 0.5 mg nicotine in 50 ~d and 0.14 mg xylometazoline in 140 ~1, respectively. The recommended dose of nicotine nasal spray was one spray into each nasal cavity (i. e. i mg), one to two doses per hour and not exceeding 3 doses per hour. To ensure plasma nicotine levels above the limit of quantification for a long enough time period to allow adequate pharmacokinetic calculations, two doses (each of i mg) were given with 5 min between each dose. Before administration the nicotine and decongestant spray bottles were \"primed\" by spraying five times into the air, in order to demonstrate proper functioning of the devices. To avoid nicotine contamination this was done in a separate room by someone not involved in taking the blood samples. One spray (0.5 mg nicotine) of nicotine solution was sprayed into each nasal cavity by one of the investigators. The procedure was repeated after 5 min of quiet rest. The nozzle of the spray bottle was inserted parallel to the septum, with its front edge just inside the nasal vestibule. The nozzle was pointed between the frontal wall and the nasal floor. The subject had to blow his nose before the first dose and to sit upright during treatment. The vasoconstrictor xylometazoline was administered 30 min prior to the nicotine nasal spray. One spray (0.14 mg xylometazoline) was given into each nostril. Common cold/rhinitis was confirmed by fulfillment of Criteria 1 and/or 2 and Criterion, 3 as described below [6] . A total score of 14 points or more for the following symptoms characteristic of the common cold: sneezing, headache, malaise, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough graded 0-3 (none, mild, moderate, severe) by the subject and reported in response to active questioning according to a checklist. Oral contraceptives were allowed. There were no restrictions on the use of OTC products, except nasal decongestants, neither before nor during the study. No prescribed medication or drug under investigation was used concomitantly with the study drug. Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected from an antecubital vein into sodium heparinised glass tubes at the following times: 0 (directly prior to administration) and 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after administration of the first dose. The blood samples were cooled and centrifuged at 4°C within 30 min and plasma was transferred to cryo-tubes which were kept frozen (-20 °C) pending analysis. Nicotine was determined by capillary gas chromatography after single step liquid-liquid extraction of the plasma sample. It was detected by means of a nitrogen sensitive detector of high selectivity and sensitivity [7] . The precision of the method above the 0.7 ng/ ml level of nicotine was better than 11.0 % C.V., and above 4 ng/ ml it was better than 6.0 % C.V. The level of quantification was 0.6 ng. m1-1. For each administration the following calculations were performed: AUCin r was calculated as AUC o t, where t denotes the last time point, by the linear trapezoidal method plus the area from t-~ using the equation C tt kel The elimination rate constant, kel , was obtained by linear regression of the plasma concentration values of the terminal slope of the logarithmic plasma concentration-time curve. The maximum nicotine plasma concentration (Cm~×) and the time to peak plasma concentration (tma.0 were determined from the observed plasma concentration-time curve, hgCin f and Cma x were corrected for baseline nicotine concentration (Co) as shown below: The impression of the subject him/herself that a common cold had developed, with fewer than 14 symptom points. The presence both of increased nasal discharge (rhinorrhoea) and swelling (graded 1-3), as assessed by anterior rhinoscopy. The degree of swelling, nasal discharge and reddening was estimated using a scale of 0-3 points. These scores were not included in the total symptom score. The variables AUC and Cma ~ were analysed using ANOVA (least squares means) and after natural logarithm transformation of the variable, while tma x was analysed using the Wilcoxon test and rank transformed data. The conventional methodology of bioequivalence analysis was used to evaluate the effect of common cold/rhinitis and xylometazoline on the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered nicotine. The following comparisons were made (test/reference): common cold/rhinitis vs normal and rhinitis + xylometazoline vs normal. Bioequivalence, i.e. lack of interaction, which was assessed both for the rate (C .... ti,a× ) and extent (AUCinf) , was accepted if the 90 % confidence interval (with error from ANOVA) for the log transformed AUCinF, Cma x-and tmax-ratios (test/reference) were contained within the interval 0.8-1.25 (AUCinf, Cmax) and 0.7-1.43 (tmax). \"time (h) Fig. 1 Mean with SEM plasma nicotine concentrations in fifteen subjects with infectious rhinitis, after concomitant use of a topical decongestant, and in normal health, following an intranasal spray of 2 mg nicotine. For clarity the plasma concentration-time curve for rhinitis without concomitant xylometazoline, which was very similar to that for rhinitis + xylometazoline, has been omitted Mean uncorrected plasma nicotine levels were very similar in the disease-free state and during rhinitis and rhinitis plus xylometazoline. Mean plasma levels are shown in Fig. 1 . The mean (SD) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) corrected for baseline nicotine concentration in rhinitis was 4.7 (2.3) ng. m1-1 compared to 6.0 (3.4) ng. ml -I in the disease-free state. A Cma x of 4.6 (2.3) rig. ml -~ was found during rhinitis plus concomitant use of the decongestant (Table 1) . Time to peak concentration (tmax) was inversely related to Cm~×. Accordingly, tma x occurred later in rhinitis, at 0.40 (0.16)h than in the disease-free state, at 0.28 (0.09) h. The tma x was further prolonged to 0.52 (0.22) h in rhinitis treated with xylometazoline. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) corrected for baseline nicotine concentration in rhinitis and in rhinitis with xylometazoline was estimated to be 15.9 (5.81) ng • m1-1 . h and 18.9 (6.67)ng-ml -j-h, respectively. The AgCin f during the disease-free state was 17.9 (7.69) ng • m1-1 . h ( Table 1 ). The mean elimination half-life estimated in the disease-free state was 3.6 h and in rhinitis with and without the decongestant it was 3.4 h. The mean bioavailability of intranasal nicotine was similar in common cold/rhinitis and in the disease-free state. The geometric mean of the ratio AUCrhin./ AUCnorrn. was 0.93 (90 % CI 0.78-1.12). The peak plasma concentration ratio was 0.81 (0.67-0.98), and the ratio of the times to peak concentration was 1.36 (1.12-1.64); the latter was significantly longer in common cold/rhinitis compared to the disease-free state (P < 0.01). As the 90 % confidence intervals were outside the bioequivalence ranges, 0.8-1.25 for AUCin f and Cm~ × and 0.7-1.43 for tmax, common cold/rhinitis as compared to the disease-free state was not considered equivalent, neither in terms of the rate nor of the extent of nicotine absorption. When xylometazoline was given 30 rain prior to the nicotine nasal spray during the common cold/rhinitis, the area under the nicotine plasma concentration-time curve was somewhat larger than when the nicotine spray was used during normal health. The geometric mean of the AUC-ratio was 1.11 (90 % C1 0.98-1.33). This was outside the upper limit of the equivalence range for the extent of bioavailability (0.8-1.25), indicating that at least as much nicotine was available to the systemic circulation during common cold/rhinitis after pretreatment with decongestant as in the diseasefree state. There was significantly slower nicotine absorption when the rhinitis was treated with the vasoconstrictor decongestant as compared to the disease-free state, as indicated both by a lower Cma x (P < 0.05) and a later tma x (P < 0.001). On applying conventional bioequivalence criteria, the two experimental situations could not be considered to be equivalent; the geometric means of the ratios of Cma ~ and tma x were 0.79 (0.65-0.95) and 1.72 (1.43-2.08), respectively. Most commonly reported adverse events were sneezing, irritation in the throat and headache. All events were rated as mild by the subjects, except for one report of headache that was rated as moderate. The latter was reported in the common cold/rhinitis session and so could not be discriminated from the symptoms of the disease itself.  Nasal administration of nicotine has recently found pratical use as an aid in smoking withdrawal programmes [8, 9] . Disease affecting the nasal mucosa, e.g. inflammation with nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, may interfere with the absorption of intranasally administered nicotine, so it might be necessary to adjust the dose during a cold. In the present study we applied the methodology of bioequivalence testing rather than testing the null-hypothesis of equality between disease and non-disease states to demonstrate whether the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered nicotine was affected to a clinically relevant extent by rhinitis and by a topical decongestant. This could not be concluded if the classical hypothesis testing of no difference between the two situations had been tested. Instead, it is necessary to show that the rate and extent of absorption of intranasal nicotine in the disease and non-disease states were equivalent, i.e. the ratios of Cma x and AUC (and their 90 % confidence intervals) were contained within the clinically accepted range of 0.8 to 1.25. That would ensure that the consumer risk would not exceed 5 %. Recent studies have shown that the absorption permeability of the nasal mucosa is decreased during inflammation, e.g. during active seasonal allergic rhinitis at the end of the pollen season [10] , as well as during a common cold (corona-virus induced rhinitis) [11] . A possible explanation for the reduced absorption is the exudation of bulk plasma into the subepithelial tissues and into the airway lumen [12] . A further complicating factor for drugs given topically in the nose during a common cold is concomitant treatment with a locally administered vasoconstrictor. In rhinitis it has previously been demonstrated that there is an increase of 22 % (from 41 to 50 ml • min -t • 100 g-1 tissue) in the nasal mucosal blood flow compared to the disease-free state [13] . When a topical vasoconstrictor is given there is a reduction of 53 % (from 50 to 23 ml. rain -1 • 100 g-1 tissue) in the increased blood flow [13] . Thus, the nasal mucosal blood flow in the common cold after treatment with a local vasoconstrictor is approximately 40 % lower than in the diseasefree state. In the present study we demonstrated that rhinitis reduced the mean peak plasma nicotine concentration and significantly prolonged the time to peak concentration of intranasally administered nicotine. Pretreatment with xylometazoline further prolonged the absorption time in comparison with untreated rhinitis without affecting the peak plasma nicotine level. As the extent of absorption was largely unaffected, the data indicate slowing of the absorption process. The reduced rate of nicotine absorption during the common cold was probably the result of slower access of nicotine to the subepithelial capillaries in the well vascularised nasal mucosa [12] , and the further reduction found after pretreatment with the vasoconstrictor was the result of a decrease in the nasal mucosal blood flow [13] . The bioequivalence ranges adopted in the present study were 0.8-1.25 for the extent of bioavailability and the maximum plasma concentration, and 0.7-1.43 for the time to reach maximum concentration. In general, the appropriate bioequivalence range should be chosen on clinical grounds. Thus, for a drug like nicotine, with a broad therapeutic range and the self-titration behaviour of smokers [14] , wider confidence limits should be considered. The results suggest that a minor proportion of those quitting smoking with the help of a nicotine nasal spray may experience a minor reduction of the effect during common cold/rhinitis. However, the nicotine self-titration behaviour found with most smoking cessation products (except the nicotine patch) will automatically lead to adjustment of the dosage to achieve the desired effect.",

To ensure plasma nicotine levels above the limit of quantification for a long enough time period to allow adequate pharmacokinetic calculations, two doses (each of i mg) were given with 5 min between each dose. Before administration the nicotine and decongestant spray bottles were \"primed\" by spraying five times into the air, in order to demonstrate proper functioning of the devices. To avoid nicotine contamination this was done in a separate room by someone not involved in taking the blood samples. One spray (0.5 mg nicotine) of nicotine solution was sprayed into each nasal cavity by one of the investigators. The procedure was repeated after 5 min of quiet rest. The nozzle of the spray bottle was inserted parallel to the septum, with its front edge just inside the nasal vestibule. The nozzle was pointed between the frontal wall and the nasal floor. The subject had to blow his nose before the first dose and to sit upright during treatment. The vasoconstrictor xylometazoline was administered 30 min prior to the nicotine nasal spray. One spray (0.14 mg xylometazoline) was given into each nostril. Common cold/rhinitis was confirmed by fulfillment of Criteria 1 and/or 2 and Criterion, 3 as described below [6] . A total score of 14 points or more for the following symptoms characteristic of the common cold: sneezing, headache, malaise, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough graded 0-3 (none, mild, moderate, severe) by the subject and reported in response to active questioning according to a checklist. Oral contraceptives were allowed. There were no restrictions on the use of OTC products, except nasal decongestants, neither before nor during the study. No prescribed medication or drug under investigation was used concomitantly with the study drug. Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected from an antecubital vein into sodium heparinised glass tubes at the following times: 0 (directly prior to administration) and 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after administration of the first dose. The blood samples were cooled and centrifuged at 4°C within 30 min and plasma was transferred to cryo-tubes which were kept frozen (-20 °C) pending analysis. Nicotine was determined by capillary gas chromatography after single step liquid-liquid extraction of the plasma sample. It was detected by means of a nitrogen sensitive detector of high selectivity and sensitivity [7] . The precision of the method above the 0.7 ng/ ml level of nicotine was better than 11.0 % C.V., and above 4 ng/ ml it was better than 6.0 % C.V. The level of quantification was 0.6 ng. m1-1. For each administration the following calculations were performed: AUCin r was calculated as AUC o t, where t denotes the last time point, by the linear trapezoidal method plus the area from t-~ using the equation C tt kel The elimination rate constant, kel , was obtained by linear regression of the plasma concentration values of the terminal slope of the logarithmic plasma concentration-time curve. The maximum nicotine plasma concentration (Cm~×) and the time to peak plasma concentration (tma.0 were determined from the observed plasma concentration-time curve, hgCin f and Cma x were corrected for baseline nicotine concentration (Co) as shown below: The impression of the subject him/herself that a common cold had developed, with fewer than 14 symptom points. The presence both of increased nasal discharge (rhinorrhoea) and swelling (graded 1-3), as assessed by anterior rhinoscopy. The degree of swelling, nasal discharge and reddening was estimated using a scale of 0-3 points. These scores were not included in the total symptom score. The variables AUC and Cma ~ were analysed using ANOVA (least squares means) and after natural logarithm transformation of the variable, while tma x was analysed using the Wilcoxon test and rank transformed data. The conventional methodology of bioequivalence analysis was used to evaluate the effect of common cold/rhinitis and xylometazoline on the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered nicotine. The following comparisons were made (test/reference): common cold/rhinitis vs normal and rhinitis + xylometazoline vs normal. Bioequivalence, i.e. lack of interaction, which was assessed both for the rate (C .... ti,a× ) and extent (AUCinf) , was accepted if the 90 % confidence interval (with error from ANOVA) for the log transformed AUCinF, Cma x-and tmax-ratios (test/reference) were contained within the interval 0.8-1.25 (AUCinf, Cmax) and 0.7-1.43 (tmax). \"time (h) Fig. 1 Mean with SEM plasma nicotine concentrations in fifteen subjects with infectious rhinitis, after concomitant use of a topical decongestant, and in normal health, following an intranasal spray of 2 mg nicotine. For clarity the plasma concentration-time curve for rhinitis without concomitant xylometazoline, which was very similar to that for rhinitis + xylometazoline, has been omitted Mean uncorrected plasma nicotine levels were very similar in the disease-free state and during rhinitis and rhinitis plus xylometazoline. Mean plasma levels are shown in Fig. 1 . The mean (SD) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) corrected for baseline nicotine concentration in rhinitis was 4.7 (2.3) ng. m1-1 compared to 6.0 (3.4) ng. ml -I in the disease-free state. A Cma x of 4.6 (2.3) rig. ml -~ was found during rhinitis plus concomitant use of the decongestant (Table 1) . Time to peak concentration (tmax) was inversely related to Cm~×. Accordingly, tma x occurred later in rhinitis, at 0.40 (0.16)h than in the disease-free state, at 0.28 (0.09) h. The tma x was further prolonged to 0.52 (0.22) h in rhinitis treated with xylometazoline. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) corrected for baseline nicotine concentration in rhinitis and in rhinitis with xylometazoline was estimated to be 15.9 (5.81) ng • m1-1 . h and 18.9 (6.67)ng-ml -j-h, respectively. The AgCin f during the disease-free state was 17.9 (7.69) ng • m1-1 . h ( Table 1 ). The mean elimination half-life estimated in the disease-free state was 3.6 h and in rhinitis with and without the decongestant it was 3.4 h. The mean bioavailability of intranasal nicotine was similar in common cold/rhinitis and in the disease-free state. The geometric mean of the ratio AUCrhin./ AUCnorrn. was 0.93 (90 % CI 0.78-1.12). The peak plasma concentration ratio was 0.81 (0.67-0.98), and the ratio of the times to peak concentration was 1.36 (1.12-1.64); the latter was significantly longer in common cold/rhinitis compared to the disease-free state (P < 0.01). As the 90 % confidence intervals were outside the bioequivalence ranges, 0.8-1.25 for AUCin f and Cm~ × and 0.7-1.43 for tmax, common cold/rhinitis as compared to the disease-free state was not considered equivalent, neither in terms of the rate nor of the extent of nicotine absorption. When xylometazoline was given 30 rain prior to the nicotine nasal spray during the common cold/rhinitis, the area under the nicotine plasma concentration-time curve was somewhat larger than when the nicotine spray was used during normal health. The geometric mean of the AUC-ratio was 1.11 (90 % C1 0.98-1.33). This was outside the upper limit of the equivalence range for the extent of bioavailability (0.8-1.25), indicating that at least as much nicotine was available to the systemic circulation during common cold/rhinitis after pretreatment with decongestant as in the diseasefree state. There was significantly slower nicotine absorption when the rhinitis was treated with the vasoconstrictor decongestant as compared to the disease-free state, as indicated both by a lower Cma x (P < 0.05) and a later tma x (P < 0.001). On applying conventional bioequivalence criteria, the two experimental situations could not be considered to be equivalent; the geometric means of the ratios of Cma ~ and tma x were 0.79 (0.65-0.95) and 1.72 (1.43-2.08), respectively. Most commonly reported adverse events were sneezing, irritation in the throat and headache. All events were rated as mild by the subjects, except for one report of headache that was rated as moderate. The latter was reported in the common cold/rhinitis session and so could not be discriminated from the symptoms of the disease itself.  Nasal administration of nicotine has recently found pratical use as an aid in smoking withdrawal programmes [8, 9] . Disease affecting the nasal mucosa, e.g. inflammation with nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, may interfere with the absorption of intranasally administered nicotine, so it might be necessary to adjust the dose during a cold. In the present study we applied the methodology of bioequivalence testing rather than testing the null-hypothesis of equality between disease and non-disease states to demonstrate whether the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered nicotine was affected to a clinically relevant extent by rhinitis and by a topical decongestant. This could not be concluded if the classical hypothesis testing of no difference between the two situations had been tested. Instead, it is necessary to show that the rate and extent of absorption of intranasal nicotine in the disease and non-disease states were equivalent, i.e. the ratios of Cma x and AUC (and their 90 % confidence intervals) were contained within the clinically accepted range of 0.8 to 1.25. That would ensure that the consumer risk would not exceed 5 %. Recent studies have shown that the absorption permeability of the nasal mucosa is decreased during inflammation, e.g. during active seasonal allergic rhinitis at the end of the pollen season [10] , as well as during a common cold (corona-virus induced rhinitis) [11] . A possible explanation for the reduced absorption is the exudation of bulk plasma into the subepithelial tissues and into the airway lumen [12] . A further complicating factor for drugs given topically in the nose during a common cold is concomitant treatment with a locally administered vasoconstrictor. In rhinitis it has previously been demonstrated that there is an increase of 22 % (from 41 to 50 ml • min -t • 100 g-1 tissue) in the nasal mucosal blood flow compared to the disease-free state [13] . When a topical vasoconstrictor is given there is a reduction of 53 % (from 50 to 23 ml. rain -1 • 100 g-1 tissue) in the increased blood flow [13] . Thus, the nasal mucosal blood flow in the common cold after treatment with a local vasoconstrictor is approximately 40 % lower than in the diseasefree state. In the present study we demonstrated that rhinitis reduced the mean peak plasma nicotine concentration and significantly prolonged the time to peak concentration of intranasally administered nicotine. Pretreatment with xylometazoline further prolonged the absorption time in comparison with untreated rhinitis without affecting the peak plasma nicotine level. As the extent of absorption was largely unaffected, the data indicate slowing of the absorption process. The reduced rate of nicotine absorption during the common cold was probably the result of slower access of nicotine to the subepithelial capillaries in the well vascularised nasal mucosa [12] , and the further reduction found after pretreatment with the vasoconstrictor was the result of a decrease in the nasal mucosal blood flow [13] . The bioequivalence ranges adopted in the present study were 0.8-1.25 for the extent of bioavailability and the maximum plasma concentration, and 0.7-1.43 for the time to reach maximum concentration. In general, the appropriate bioequivalence range should be chosen on clinical grounds. Thus, for a drug like nicotine, with a broad therapeutic range and the self-titration behaviour of smokers [14] , wider confidence limits should be considered. The results suggest that a minor proportion of those quitting smoking with the help of a nicotine nasal spray may experience a minor reduction of the effect during common cold/rhinitis. However, the nicotine self-titration behaviour found with most smoking cessation products (except the nicotine patch) will automatically lead to adjustment of the dosage to achieve the desired effect.",

         "Tobacco (Nicotiana tobaccum L.) is widely grown as a non-food cash crop. As new relevant materials showed, China produced about 1840.5 million kg tobacco leaves in 2005 which amounts to 36.5% of the total output, and China has become the largest producing country in the world [1] . Tobacco leaves are mainly used for making cigarettes, cigars and for chewing. Large quantities of tobacco wastes are generated during processing and cigarette making which amounts to 25% of the total tobacco material, and China also has become the largest producing tobacco wastes country in the world. At the same time, disposal of these wastes is a serious problem nowadays, because tobacco wastes are toxic due to the presence of nicotine, and European Union Regulations (EUR) and Italian law classify tobacco wastes as ''toxic and hazardous wastes'' when the nicotine content exceeds 500 mg kg -1 dw [2] . However, besides nicotine, there are some other biologically important compounds in tobacco wastes, such as phenolic compounds [3] , solanesol [4] , transgenic proteins [5] , and so on. Recently, the chemical compositions of N. tabacum and tobacco wastes have attracted considerable attentions worldwide [3] , and tobacco wastes are considered to be a good source of a large number of bioactive substances. Moreover the report of utilization of solanesol from tobacco wastes [6] let us study the synthetic utilization of their active compounds, but not to degrade or discard them. In view of the potential pharmaceutical application, the identification of phenolic compounds from tobacco wastes is therefore of essential importance. Phenolic compounds exist mostly in the form of glycosides or esters in living plants. They not only have important physiological and some pharmacological activities, but also influence the quality and property of some bioproducts [7] . Polyphenol compounds include tannins, coumarins, flavonols, anthocyanins, hydroxylated cyclohexanes and other phenol derivatives, which can affect the aroma of cigarettes, exist in tobacco (N.tabacum L.). Among them, chlorogonic acids and rutin are the most abundant polyphenols [8] . Unfortunately, less attention has been paid to the analysis and separation of phenolic compounds in tobacco wastes. Chlorogenic acid is the only one compound in the large family, the best known conjugates are those with quinic acid, collectively known as chlorogenic acids (CGAs) or caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) [9] . Classically, chlorogenic acids (CQAs) are a family of esters and related derivatives formed between certain trans cinnamic acids and (-)-quinic acid (1L-1(OH), 3,4,5-tetrahydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid), the cinnamic acids most commonly encountered are caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic [9, 10] . Compounds in this family possess a wide range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, hepatocyte protective, antimutagenic, inhibition of HIV-1 RT and activities against human herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses, anti-SARS and anti-AIV(H5N1) activities [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . On the other hand, the tobacco manufacturing process and all the activities which use tobacco often produce tobacco wastes, and of the different solid wastes produced during the process. So, it is difficult to study the composition of CQAs in tobacco wastes. At the same time, profiling the phenolic compounds of tobacco wastes is important to the synthetic utilization of their active compounds. Recently, LC-MS n has been used to characterize cinnamoylamino acid conjugates and to discriminate between individual isomers of mono-acyl and di-acyl chlorogenic acids [10, 19] , and also used to characterize flavanoids [20] . MS fragmentation data have been utilized to develop structure-diagnostic hierarchical keys for the identification of phenolic compounds. In this study, LC-MS was applied to the qualitative profiling of phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and caffeic acid (CA), see Fig. 1 ) in tobacco wastes. To enhance the separation of four compounds, a rapid, accurate and reliable LC-UV method was developed for the quantitative analysis of mark compounds in tobacco wastes samples. The tobacco wastes were collected from various countries and regions in the world in 2007, and authenticated as the wastes of by Prof. Ding-qiang Lu (College of Life Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology). Ten of these waste samples were dried at 60°C, powered by a herb disintegrator (Qinzhou Sanyang Package Equipment Co.) and then sieved (60 mesh). LC-grade acetonitrile and acetic acid were purchased from TEDIA Co. (Fairfield, OH, USA); Chlorogenic acid (5-caffecylquinic acid, 5-CQA) and caffeic acid (CA) were purchased from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (NICPBP), Beijing, China. Cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA) and neochlorogenic  LC separation was performed on an Alltima C 18 (250 9 4.6 mm, 5 lm) column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA). The mobile phase contained solvents A and B, where A was water: acetonitrile: acetic acid (97.5:2:0.5, v/v/v) and B was acetonitrile: acetic acid (99.5:0.5, v/v/v). The linear gradient profile was maintained 2% B in 5 min, from 2 to 5% in 5 min, from 5 to 10% in 20 min, from 10 to 35% in 35 min, from 35 to 100% in 15 min, from 100 to 2% in 5 min, and maintained 2% B in 5 min. The wavelength range of PAD detection was from 200 to 400 nm. The flow-rate was 1 mL min -1 for LC and PAD detection with the column kept at 40°C. A splitter was connected between the PAD and MS detectors, which reduced the flow rate to 0.2 mL min -1 for MS detection. The electrospray ESI-MS-ES was operated in the negative ion mode with scanning High purity nitrogen (99.9%) was used as dry gas to evaporate the solvent at a flow rate of 500 L h -1 at 350°C. Nitrogen was also used as nebuliser gas at 50 psi. LC-UV separation was performed on an Alltima C 18 (250 9 4.6 mm, 5 lm) column (Alltech). The mobile phase contained acetonitrile: ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (5:95, v/v). The flowrate was 1 mL min -1 and UV detection with the column kept at 30°C, detected at 327 nm. The reference standards of the target compounds, i. e., 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA were accurately weighed, and their stock solution of 500, 450, 500 and 300 lg mL -1 concentration were prepared by dissolving in methanol, respectively. Then, the stock solutions were diluted to appropriate concentration ranges for the establishment of calibration curves. All solutions were stored at 4°C. The powered samples (5.0 g) were extracted assisted by ultrasonic wave with 70% v/v aqueous methanol (125 mL) in an ultrasonic bath at 45°C for 45 min, to give an extraction yield of more than 70%. The extraction process was repeated two times, and the extract constant a volume of 500 mL. The obtained solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 lm filter before injection. All samples were determined in triplicate. LC chromatographic profiles of the 70% v/v aqueous methanol extract of tobacco wastes detected with negative ion mode ESI-MS and UV at 320 nm, see Fig. 1 . In the methanolic extract of dried tobacco wastes, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA were identified by comparing their retention times, UV (Fig. 1a) , ESI-TIC (Fig. 1b) , MS spectras and chemical structures (Fig.1c) with those of standard compounds. The structure of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA were determined by MS SCAN model, and by comparing the UV and MS spectra data to those reported in the literature. These results show that CQAs in tobacco wastes are mainly composed of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA. In order to obtain optimal extraction, effect of extraction solvent, method, temperature and time on the extraction yield of active components from tobacco wastes were investigated. The results show that the extraction efficiency was highest when 70% methanol were used as solvent, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) was found to be more suitable than heat-reflux extraction (HRE) for the preparation of test samples, the optimal extraction temperature and solid-liquid ratio in UAE were 45°C and 1:25, respectively. The extraction yield of mark compounds was obtained almost 70% within 45 min in single-time extraction. Therefore, the optimal preparation method of four components in tobacco wastes were as follows: test samples were extracted with 70% v/v aqueous methanol by using UAE at 45°C for 45 min, which process was repeated twice. To obtain chromatograms with a good separation and resolution of adjacent peaks within a short analysis time, mobile phase, column temperature and flow rate were optimized. The mobile phase containing acid, which could suppress the ionization of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups was beneficial for good retention and separation of chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic and caffeic acids. Different mobile phase compositions (such as CH 3  were attempted to separate the investigated four components. Acetonitrile:ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (5:95 v/v) was chosen as the eluting solvent system because efficient separation and desired peak shape could be achieved. Under isocratic elution modes, the four compounds could be separated effectively. The effect of temperature on the separation was investigated in the range of 25-40°C, 30°C was found to be optimal. The most suitable flow rate was found to be 1.0 mL min -1 . Since their polarity, solubility and other characteristics differ greatly; at least 15 min of elution time were needed for the simultaneous quantification of the four target compounds. On the basis of the UV-VIS spectra of the four components recorded by DAD detection in the range of 190-800 nm, experimental results indicate that four components have the same UV absorption peaks of about 327 nm, so 327 nm was selected for monitoring. Chromatograms of standard mixture (A) and tobacco wastes sample (B) are shown in Fig. 2 , peak shape of the four compounds in tobacco wastes were symmetrical. Under the optimized isocratic elution conditions chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid were separated with resolution greater than gradient elusion model. Each component in the samples analyzed was identified by comparing its retention time to that of the respective standard. Retention time for 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 4-CQA and CA were 4.9, 6.2, 7.4 and 11.3 min, respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Quantification was carried out by integration of the peaks using external standards. As shown in Fig. 2 , the LC-UV method was specific for separation of 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 4-CQA and CA in tobacco wastes. Calibration curves were obtained by plotting peak areas versus six different concentrations of standard solutions. Response (peak area, Y) was then plotted against concentration (X, lg mL -1 ) and the six-point calibration curves were found to be linear as least squares regression gave a correlation coefficient. The equations were: neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) Y = 6.196 9 10 7 X -4.453 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9997), chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) Y = 5.841 9 10 7 X -4.384 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9996), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA) Y = 5.068 9 10 7 X -4.025 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9996), caffeic acid (CA) Y = 8.325 9 10 7 X -5.946 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9993), respectively. The lowest acceptable level of the calibration curve was regarded as the limit of quantification (LOQ). The LOQ of neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic and caffeic acids were 0.719, 0.751, 0.795 and 0.714 lg mL -1 , respectively. The limits of detection (LOD; S/N = 3) of neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic and caffeic acids were 0.360, 0.376, 0.398 and 0.357 lg mL -1 , respectively. The LOD and LOQ values of the individual compound and the good linearity for each investigated compound indicated that the developed analytical method is precise and sensi-  The repeatability of the method in the present work was examined by the intraday and inter-day variability. The intraday variability was examined on six individual samples within 1 day, and inter-day variability was determined for three different days. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated as a measurement of method repeatability. The results shown in Table 1 indicated that the intra-and inter-day RSD values of the four marker compounds were less than 0.2%, which showed good reproducibility. The precision was evaluated using the results of five replicate injections of the standard solutions containing the four components. The results showed a good precision, and RSDs were less than 0.2%. For the stability test, the same sample solution was analyzed at different times within 48 h at room temperature. The RSD values of the peak areas were all lower than 1.0%, suggesting that it is safe to analyze the sample within 2 days. Standard addition test was performed to determine the accuracy as well as the extraction recovery. In this test, the mixed standard solutions were prepared with three different concentration levels.  The developed analytical method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA in ten samples of tobacco wastes which were obtained from various countries and regions in the world, analysis results are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2 , the contents of four ingredients varied greatly among the different samples. In the majority of cases, 5-CQA was the main component, whose contents varied from 0.686 to 1.781% in ten samples, with almost 2.6-fold variation. Similar variation could also be found for the other components. The reason for the variation of the contents can be the difference of plant origin, the effect of environment and some other factors, such as season of collection, drying process and storage conditions, etc. Because variations of the marker compounds may influence the quality and potency of the tobacco wastes, it was necessary to develop an effective qualitative and quantitative method to evaluate the quality of tobacco wastes. The assay of one or two constituents only cannot give a complete assessment of the biomass. Thus, in this paper, four major compounds in tobacco wastes were analyzed simultaneously to evaluate its quality. This is the first report on the simultaneous determination of neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic and caffeic acids in tobacco wastes. The developed method was found to be rapid, linear, reliable and accurate. The validation procedure and assay results suggested that this LC-UV method is promising for being used in quality control of tobacco wastes.",

Moreover the report of utilization of solanesol from tobacco wastes [6] let us study the synthetic utilization of their active compounds, but not to degrade or discard them. In view of the potential pharmaceutical application, the identification of phenolic compounds from tobacco wastes is therefore of essential importance. Phenolic compounds exist mostly in the form of glycosides or esters in living plants. They not only have important physiological and some pharmacological activities, but also influence the quality and property of some bioproducts [7] . Polyphenol compounds include tannins, coumarins, flavonols, anthocyanins, hydroxylated cyclohexanes and other phenol derivatives, which can affect the aroma of cigarettes, exist in tobacco (N.tabacum L.). Among them, chlorogonic acids and rutin are the most abundant polyphenols [8] . Unfortunately, less attention has been paid to the analysis and separation of phenolic compounds in tobacco wastes. Chlorogenic acid is the only one compound in the large family, the best known conjugates are those with quinic acid, collectively known as chlorogenic acids (CGAs) or caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) [9] . Classically, chlorogenic acids (CQAs) are a family of esters and related derivatives formed between certain trans cinnamic acids and (-)-quinic acid (1L-1(OH), 3,4,5-tetrahydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid), the cinnamic acids most commonly encountered are caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic [9, 10] . Compounds in this family possess a wide range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, hepatocyte protective, antimutagenic, inhibition of HIV-1 RT and activities against human herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses, anti-SARS and anti-AIV(H5N1) activities [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . On the other hand, the tobacco manufacturing process and all the activities which use tobacco often produce tobacco wastes, and of the different solid wastes produced during the process. So, it is difficult to study the composition of CQAs in tobacco wastes. At the same time, profiling the phenolic compounds of tobacco wastes is important to the synthetic utilization of their active compounds. Recently, LC-MS n has been used to characterize cinnamoylamino acid conjugates and to discriminate between individual isomers of mono-acyl and di-acyl chlorogenic acids [10, 19] , and also used to characterize flavanoids [20] . MS fragmentation data have been utilized to develop structure-diagnostic hierarchical keys for the identification of phenolic compounds. In this study, LC-MS was applied to the qualitative profiling of phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and caffeic acid (CA), see Fig. 1 ) in tobacco wastes. To enhance the separation of four compounds, a rapid, accurate and reliable LC-UV method was developed for the quantitative analysis of mark compounds in tobacco wastes samples. The tobacco wastes were collected from various countries and regions in the world in 2007, and authenticated as the wastes of by Prof. Ding-qiang Lu (College of Life Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology). Ten of these waste samples were dried at 60°C, powered by a herb disintegrator (Qinzhou Sanyang Package Equipment Co.) and then sieved (60 mesh). LC-grade acetonitrile and acetic acid were purchased from TEDIA Co. (Fairfield, OH, USA); Chlorogenic acid (5-caffecylquinic acid, 5-CQA) and caffeic acid (CA) were purchased from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (NICPBP), Beijing, China. Cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA) and neochlorogenic  LC separation was performed on an Alltima C 18 (250 9 4.6 mm, 5 lm) column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA). The mobile phase contained solvents A and B, where A was water: acetonitrile: acetic acid (97.5:2:0.5, v/v/v) and B was acetonitrile: acetic acid (99.5:0.5, v/v/v). The linear gradient profile was maintained 2% B in 5 min, from 2 to 5% in 5 min, from 5 to 10% in 20 min, from 10 to 35% in 35 min, from 35 to 100% in 15 min, from 100 to 2% in 5 min, and maintained 2% B in 5 min. The wavelength range of PAD detection was from 200 to 400 nm. The flow-rate was 1 mL min -1 for LC and PAD detection with the column kept at 40°C. A splitter was connected between the PAD and MS detectors, which reduced the flow rate to 0.2 mL min -1 for MS detection. The electrospray ESI-MS-ES was operated in the negative ion mode with scanning High purity nitrogen (99.9%) was used as dry gas to evaporate the solvent at a flow rate of 500 L h -1 at 350°C. Nitrogen was also used as nebuliser gas at 50 psi. LC-UV separation was performed on an Alltima C 18 (250 9 4.6 mm, 5 lm) column (Alltech). The mobile phase contained acetonitrile: ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (5:95, v/v). The flowrate was 1 mL min -1 and UV detection with the column kept at 30°C, detected at 327 nm. The reference standards of the target compounds, i. e., 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA were accurately weighed, and their stock solution of 500, 450, 500 and 300 lg mL -1 concentration were prepared by dissolving in methanol, respectively. Then, the stock solutions were diluted to appropriate concentration ranges for the establishment of calibration curves. All solutions were stored at 4°C. The powered samples (5.0 g) were extracted assisted by ultrasonic wave with 70% v/v aqueous methanol (125 mL) in an ultrasonic bath at 45°C for 45 min, to give an extraction yield of more than 70%. The extraction process was repeated two times, and the extract constant a volume of 500 mL. The obtained solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 lm filter before injection. All samples were determined in triplicate. LC chromatographic profiles of the 70% v/v aqueous methanol extract of tobacco wastes detected with negative ion mode ESI-MS and UV at 320 nm, see Fig. 1 . In the methanolic extract of dried tobacco wastes, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA were identified by comparing their retention times, UV (Fig. 1a) , ESI-TIC (Fig. 1b) , MS spectras and chemical structures (Fig.1c) with those of standard compounds. The structure of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA were determined by MS SCAN model, and by comparing the UV and MS spectra data to those reported in the literature. These results show that CQAs in tobacco wastes are mainly composed of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA. In order to obtain optimal extraction, effect of extraction solvent, method, temperature and time on the extraction yield of active components from tobacco wastes were investigated. The results show that the extraction efficiency was highest when 70% methanol were used as solvent, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) was found to be more suitable than heat-reflux extraction (HRE) for the preparation of test samples, the optimal extraction temperature and solid-liquid ratio in UAE were 45°C and 1:25, respectively. The extraction yield of mark compounds was obtained almost 70% within 45 min in single-time extraction. Therefore, the optimal preparation method of four components in tobacco wastes were as follows: test samples were extracted with 70% v/v aqueous methanol by using UAE at 45°C for 45 min, which process was repeated twice. To obtain chromatograms with a good separation and resolution of adjacent peaks within a short analysis time, mobile phase, column temperature and flow rate were optimized. The mobile phase containing acid, which could suppress the ionization of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups was beneficial for good retention and separation of chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic and caffeic acids. Different mobile phase compositions (such as CH 3  were attempted to separate the investigated four components. Acetonitrile:ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (5:95 v/v) was chosen as the eluting solvent system because efficient separation and desired peak shape could be achieved. Under isocratic elution modes, the four compounds could be separated effectively. The effect of temperature on the separation was investigated in the range of 25-40°C, 30°C was found to be optimal. The most suitable flow rate was found to be 1.0 mL min -1 . Since their polarity, solubility and other characteristics differ greatly; at least 15 min of elution time were needed for the simultaneous quantification of the four target compounds. On the basis of the UV-VIS spectra of the four components recorded by DAD detection in the range of 190-800 nm, experimental results indicate that four components have the same UV absorption peaks of about 327 nm, so 327 nm was selected for monitoring. Chromatograms of standard mixture (A) and tobacco wastes sample (B) are shown in Fig. 2 , peak shape of the four compounds in tobacco wastes were symmetrical. Under the optimized isocratic elution conditions chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid were separated with resolution greater than gradient elusion model. Each component in the samples analyzed was identified by comparing its retention time to that of the respective standard. Retention time for 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 4-CQA and CA were 4.9, 6.2, 7.4 and 11.3 min, respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Quantification was carried out by integration of the peaks using external standards. As shown in Fig. 2 , the LC-UV method was specific for separation of 3-CQA, 5-CQA, 4-CQA and CA in tobacco wastes. Calibration curves were obtained by plotting peak areas versus six different concentrations of standard solutions. Response (peak area, Y) was then plotted against concentration (X, lg mL -1 ) and the six-point calibration curves were found to be linear as least squares regression gave a correlation coefficient. The equations were: neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) Y = 6.196 9 10 7 X -4.453 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9997), chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) Y = 5.841 9 10 7 X -4.384 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9996), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA) Y = 5.068 9 10 7 X -4.025 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9996), caffeic acid (CA) Y = 8.325 9 10 7 X -5.946 9 10 4 (r 2 = 0.9993), respectively. The lowest acceptable level of the calibration curve was regarded as the limit of quantification (LOQ). The LOQ of neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic and caffeic acids were 0.719, 0.751, 0.795 and 0.714 lg mL -1 , respectively. The limits of detection (LOD; S/N = 3) of neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic and caffeic acids were 0.360, 0.376, 0.398 and 0.357 lg mL -1 , respectively. The LOD and LOQ values of the individual compound and the good linearity for each investigated compound indicated that the developed analytical method is precise and sensi-  The repeatability of the method in the present work was examined by the intraday and inter-day variability. The intraday variability was examined on six individual samples within 1 day, and inter-day variability was determined for three different days. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated as a measurement of method repeatability. The results shown in Table 1 indicated that the intra-and inter-day RSD values of the four marker compounds were less than 0.2%, which showed good reproducibility. The precision was evaluated using the results of five replicate injections of the standard solutions containing the four components. The results showed a good precision, and RSDs were less than 0.2%. For the stability test, the same sample solution was analyzed at different times within 48 h at room temperature. The RSD values of the peak areas were all lower than 1.0%, suggesting that it is safe to analyze the sample within 2 days. Standard addition test was performed to determine the accuracy as well as the extraction recovery. In this test, the mixed standard solutions were prepared with three different concentration levels.  The developed analytical method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 5-CQA and CA in ten samples of tobacco wastes which were obtained from various countries and regions in the world, analysis results are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2 , the contents of four ingredients varied greatly among the different samples. In the majority of cases, 5-CQA was the main component, whose contents varied from 0.686 to 1.781% in ten samples, with almost 2.6-fold variation. Similar variation could also be found for the other components. The reason for the variation of the contents can be the difference of plant origin, the effect of environment and some other factors, such as season of collection, drying process and storage conditions, etc. Because variations of the marker compounds may influence the quality and potency of the tobacco wastes, it was necessary to develop an effective qualitative and quantitative method to evaluate the quality of tobacco wastes. The assay of one or two constituents only cannot give a complete assessment of the biomass. Thus, in this paper, four major compounds in tobacco wastes were analyzed simultaneously to evaluate its quality. This is the first report on the simultaneous determination of neochlorogenic, chlorogenic, cryptochlorogenic and caffeic acids in tobacco wastes. The developed method was found to be rapid, linear, reliable and accurate. The validation procedure and assay results suggested that this LC-UV method is promising for being used in quality control of tobacco wastes.",

         "A simplified procedure for the subtractive cDNA cloning of photoassimilate-responding genes: isolation of cDNAs encoding a new class of pathogenesis-related proteins",
         "Transgenic tobacco plants (ppa-1) constitutively expressing Escherichia coli pyrophosphatase behind the 35S CaMV promoter accumulate high levels of soluble sugars in their leaves [27]. These plants were considered a tool to study adaptation of leaves to photoassimilate accumulation at the molecular level. By differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in the transgenic plants 12 different cDNAs were isolated. By sequence analysis four cDNAs could be identified as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-oxidase and as three different pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-1b, PR-Q and SAR 8.2). Two cDNAs were homologous to a calmodulin-like protein from Arabidopsis and a human ribosomal protein L19 while six cDNA clones remained unknown. One of these clones (termed PAR-1 for photoassimilate-responsive) displayed features similar to pathogenesis-related proteins: Hybridizing transcripts, 1.2 and 1.0 kb in length, were strongly inducible by salicylate and accumulated in tobacco plants after infection with potato virus Y (PVY) both in infected and uninfected systemic leaves. PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated in wildtype leaves upon floating on glucose and sucrose whereas sorbitol and polyethylene glycol had no effect. Rescreening of the ppa-1 cDNA library with the PAR-1 cDNA as probe resulted in 25 hybridizing cDNAs which by homology were found to fall into three classes (PAR-1a, b, c). The cDNAs coding for PAR-1a and b were 90.6% homologous on the DNA level while both were less related to the PAR-1c cDNA (70.5% and 75.2% homologous, respectively). One open reading frame was identified in all three PAR-1 cDNA classes. Translation would result in proteins with a theoretical molecular mass of about 20 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequences resemble a signal peptide which would direct the proteins to the secretory pathway. Using selective 3′ hybridization probes of the three PAR-1 cDNAs it was possible to discriminate the different transcripts. Both PAR-1a and PAR-1c mRNAs are induced in plants treated with PVY.",

         "Plants are confronted with sugar accumulation in their leaf mesophyll cells if their photoassimilate production exceeds their utilization in sink tissues. This situation may arise when they are exposed to high light, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and/or when they suffer from sink limitations as under nitrogen deficiency or cold stress [34] . As a result of sugar accumulation the rate of sucrose synthesis decreases, starch accumulates and photosynthesis is inhibited. In contrast to the well studied biochemical mechanisms in response to sugar accumulation the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Systems used to cause an increase of assimilates in photosynthetically active plant cells are girdling (cold or hot wax collar, respectively) of source leaves, the removal of sink tissues and sugar feeding experiments using detached leaves, cell suspension cultures or protoplasts [6, 12, 13, 24] . All these experimental systems, however, are restricted to investigations of the short-term response to sugar accumulation. An alternative to study long-term adaptation of plant cells to elevated levels of sugars would be the use of transgenic plants. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing E. coli pyrophosphatase behind the constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter (ppa-1 plants) accumulate high levels of carbohydrates in their source leaves [27, 9] . These biochemical changes have been explained to be due to increased sucrose synthesis and inhibited loading of sucrose into the phloem [27, 15, 5] . In addition to the expected biochemical alterations in plant metabolism caused by the E. coli transgene a number of other phenotypical changes were observed in the transgenic tobacco plants. The high sugar levels in the source leaves lead to an increase in turgor pressure by a factor of about 9 in the transgenic as compared to wild-type plants while the water potential was essentially not changed [28] . Presumably as a consequence of the elevated turgor, the mesophyll cell enlarged two-fold as compared to wild-type cells and cell walls were found to contain 14~o and 43~o more pectin and uronic acids, respectively [28] . To study the long-term adaptation of gene expression of plants that are continuously confronted with high levels of endogenous soluble sugars we have chosen the transgenic ppa-1 plants as a tool. Here we describe the cloning and description of cDNAs from a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in the sugaraccumulating ppa-1 plants. An efficient and simpined procedure for the establishment of subtractive cDNA libraries will be presented. One of the cDNAs that could not be identified by sequence homology will be characterized in more detail and is suggested to code for a new class of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins). Standard procedures were used for recombinant DNA work [23] . Bacterial transformation were done into E. coli XLl-blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen plant material [ 16] . Poly(A) RNA was isolated by means of oligo(dT) cellulose type 7 (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) RNA was prepared from source leaves of wildtype and ppa-1 plants. 5/zg were transcribed into double-stranded cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit from Pharmacia. Eco RI-Not I adaptors (Pharmacia) were ligated to the cDNAs which were then cloned into Eco RI-digested 2ZAP II vector arms (Stratagene). After in vitro packaging using the Gigapack II packaging extract (Stratagene) recombinant lambda DNA was transfected into E. coli XL1-Blue cells (Strategene) and the titer of the cDNA libraries determined by counting the plaques. Thereafter the cDNA libraries were amplified according to the amplification protocol of Stratagene. The preparation of the subtractive library is schematically drawn in Fig. 1 . The wild-type and the ppa-1 cDNA libraries prepared as described above were in vivo excised according to the in vivo excision protocol of Stratagene. Obtained bacterial colonies were ampfified and their recombinant plasmid DNA isolated using standard procedures. 200 ktg of the wild-type plasmid cDNA library was digested with Not I while plasmids of the ppa-1 cDNA library were cut with Eco RI. cDNA fragments were then separated in agarose gels and fragments between 0.5 kb and 1.5 kb eluted. Wild-type cDNA was photobiotinylated (Clontech) according to the protocol by Strauss and Ausubel [30] . Photobiotinylated wild-type cDNA and ppa-1 cDNA fragments were mixed in a ratio 10:1, denatured at 95 °C and renatured by slowly decreasing the temperature to 25 °C. Avidin (Vectrex Avidin) was added to the mixture and wild-type and hybrid cDNA molecules removed by centrifugation. PPa-1 enriched cDNA fragments were cloned into EcoRI-digested 2ZAP II vector arms, packaged, transfected into XLl-blue cells, the titer determined and the subtractive cDNA library amplified as described above. Screening of cDNA libraries followed the DNA screening protocol by Stratagene. DNA of 2 x 104 plaque-forming units of the subtractive library were transferred onto nylon filters (Hybond N, Amersham Buchler) and hybridized to radioactively labelled wild-type cDNA. Hybridizing phage DNAs were visualized by autoradiography before the filters were hybridized to radioactively labelled ppa-1 cDNA. After autoradiographic exposure the two autoradiographies were compared to identify phage DNAs specific to ppa-1. Purified clones were in vivo excised and characterized by sequencing. Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun NN was obtained from Vereinigte Saatzuchten AG (Ebstorf, Germany). The transgenic ppa-1 tobacco plants have been described [27] .  Total RNA was denatured in 40% formamide, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose, 15% formaldehyde) and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond N; Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany). If not otherwise stated, membranes were hybridized at 42 °C in a buffer containing polyethylene glycol and 25 ~o formamide [1 ] . Radioactive labelling of DNA probes was performed using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Filters were washed three times for 20 min at 42 °C w i t h 2 x S S C ( I × SSC is 0.15 M NaC1, 0.015 M sodium citrate). Radioactive probes for screening the subtractive library were prepared as follows: 0.5 #g mRNA of wildtype and ppa-1 plants, respectively, were transcribed into double-stranded cDNA (cDNA synthesis kit, Pharmacia). This cDNA was radioactively labelled using the random primed DNA labeling kit as described above. PVY N was obtained from the Bundesanstalt far Ztichtungsforschung an Kulturpflanzen (Aschersleben, Germany). Leaves of infected tobacco plants were homogenized in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (ca. 1 g leaf material in 20 ml buffer) to obtain viral extract. Leaves to be infection were dusted with carborundum (SIC) and the viral extract applied by gently rubbing the upper face of the respective leaves with a pistil. A few minutes later the treated leaves were rinsed with water. Mature source leaves were used to apply the viral extract. 8 to 12 days after infection symptoms appeared on the plants. Plant material was homogenized with PB S buffer [23] containing 0.05% Tween-20, 2% polyvinylpyrollidone 25000, 0.2~o bovine serum albumin (1 g plant material/20 ml buffer). Serial dilutions of homogenized extract were analysed by means of the 'Double Antibody Sandwich' test using monoclonal antibodies against PVY (Bioreba, Reinach, Schweiz). The ELISA procedure was performed accordir/g to the protocol by Bioreba. In order to get ppa-l-specific cDNA clones a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in ppa-1 plants was prepared ( Fig. 1) . RNA was isolated from ppa-l-10 plants which is the best characterized ppa-1 plant line [27] . To avoid multiple cycles of subtraction with subsequent PCR amplification as developed by Straus and Ausubel for genomic subtraction [30] , the subtractive eDNA library was made by only one cycle of subtraction with subsequent selective cloning of transcripts from ppa-1 plants (Fig. 1 ). To this end the recombinant plasmids of the original cDNA libraries made from mRNA of wild-type and ppa-1 plants, respectively, were digested with different restriction enzymes, i.e. wild-type cDNA with Not I and ppa-1 cDNA with Eco RI. The respective cDNAs were eluted from agarose gels and the wild-type cDNA fragments were then photobiotinylated and hybridized to the ppa-1 cDNA. After addition of avidin wild-type as well as hybrid cDNAs were removed by centrifugation. The remaining cDNA fragments -already enriched for ppa-1 clones -were inserted into the Eco RI restriction site of the 2ZAP II vector thereby excluding the cloning of Not I-digested wild-type cDNAs. By hybridizing the same number of plaque-forming units of the subtractive library and the original ppa-1 cDNA library with the E. coli pyrophosphatase DNA (present only in the transgenic ppa-1 plants) it was found that this procedure had resulted in a ten-fold increase of ppa-1-specific clones in the subtractive library. The main advantage of this method is that amplification of the library in vivo largely excludes artifacts which are commonly found in PCRamplified cDNA libraries. One step of subtraction was performed in order not to lose cDNA clones which are only moderately induced in ppa-1 plants. homologous to the ribosomal protein L19 from man [14] while the remaining six could not be identified by sequence homologies in the databanks. Because of their responsiveness to sugar accumulation in the transgenic ppa-1 plants these cDNAs were designated PAR (1 to 6) which stands for photoassimilate-responsive genes. To get a clue about possible functions we started to analyse the expression pattern of one of the isolated unknown cDNA clones (PAR-l). In ppa-l-10 plants the steady-state RNA levels hybridizing to this unidentified cDNA increased in the order from sink to source leaves (Fig. 2b , lanes 1 to 6) which are characterized by increasing sugar levels in the same order [27] . Much weaker hybridization signals were detected in source leaves of wild-type plants (Fig. 2a, lane 6) . Signal strengths in leaves of ppa-1 plants were approximately four times more intense than in the corresponding leaves of wild-type plants as deter-Isolation of ppa-l-specific cDNA from the subtractive library by differential screening The subtractive library was successively hybridized to radioactively labelled cDNA prepared from mRNA of wild-type and ppa-1 plants. 12 differentially hybridizing clones were purified and sequenced. By homology to known sequences four cDNAs could be identified as coding for 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid oxidase [7] and for three different pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins), PR-lb [4] , PR-Q [20] and SARS.2 [35] . The DNA sequence of one cDNA clone shares homology with a calmodulinlike protein from Arabidopsis [2] and one is mined using a phosphoimager. The results were confirmed by analysing RNA from two other independent ppa-1 lines (ppa-l-5 and ppa-l-30) [27] . The unknown cDNA which was 950 bp in length hybridized to two mRNA transcripts being ca. 1.2 kb and 1.0 kb in length. Because the accumulation of transcript levels appeared to be correlated with corresponding steady-state levels of soluble sugar (Fig. 2) we wondered whether the m R N A transcripts would accumulate in wild-type leaves upon incubation with soluble sugars. Leaf discs from mature leaves of wild-type tobacco plants were therefore floated on water, glucose and sucrose (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mM) for 24 h and the RNA was analysed (Fig. 3) . The PAR-1 m R N A transcripts accumulated in response to sucrose at a concentration of 200 mM and levels increased with higher concentrations of sucrose (Fig. 3, lanes 8-14) . Floating on glucose at concentrations of 200 mM to 500 mM also lead to accumulating levels of PAR-1 mRNA although less strongly (Fig. 3,  lanes 1-7) . At a glucose concentration of 500 mM levels of PAR-I transcripts had increased 12-fold while floating on sucrose resulted in an increase of about 29-fold compared to the water control as quantified by phosphoimaging. There are multiple ways by which sugars may possibly exert their effect on gene expression. They might mediate the inducing response by being the effector molecules themselves. Alternatively, the water household may be perturbed (osmotic potential, water potential and resulting turgor pressure) or metabolic changes such as alterations in the C/N ratio may occur in response to sugar accumulation. Alternatively, sugars might induce a state of general stress resulting in changed levels of phytohormones which would regulate gene expression. To study whether the accumulation of PAR-1 transcripts was due to osmotic effects caused by an increase in the levels of soluble sugars, leaf discs were incubated in different osmolytes and the RNA was analysed. Sorbitol at concentrations of 80 and 250 mM (measured to correspond to 98 and 260 mmol/ kg), did not cause PAR-1 transcript accumulation in floating experiments (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and  4) . These concentrations were used as they were about equal in osmolality to 50 mM and 200 mM glucose (measured to be 84 and 247 mmol/kg, respectively). As expected, floating on 200 mM glucose resulted in the accumulation of PAR-1 transcripts (Fig. 4, lane 2) . No induction was observed after floating leaf discs on 7 ~o polyethylene glycol 6000 (Fig. 4, lane 5) . Altogether the data suggest that the induction of the PAR-1 transcripts by glucose and sucrose cannot be caused by osmotic changes alone. Glutamine used in floating experiments to perturb the cellular C/N ratio by increasing the level of amino acids did not lead to enhanced levels of PAR-1 transcripts either (Fig. 4, lane 6) . As cDNAs coding for PR-proteins had been isolated from the ppa-l-specific library supporting the hypothesis that sugar accumulation in leaves would result in a general stress response we wondered whether PAR-1 also possessed any features of stress-related genes. To this end the expression of the PAR-1 transcripts was studied in response to hormones associated with stress in plants by means of floating experiments (Fig. 4) . No substantial differences in transcript levels were observed after floating leaf discs on water, methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid (Fig. 4 , lanes 8 to 10)whereas levels of PAR-1 transcripts rose significantly as a result of floating leaf discs on 1 mM salicylate for 24 h (Fig. 4, lane 7) . Floating leaves on gibberellic acid and indole acetic acid as well as spraying plants with ethephon did not induce PAR-1 transcripts (data not shown).  Because of their induction by salicylate the levels o f m R N A transcripts corresponding to the PAR-1 cDNA were analysed in response to virus infection. To this end tobacco plants cv. Samsun NN were infected with PVY which on this cultivar gives rise to systemic infections (unpublished data). First symptoms of infected leaves are the browning of veins which is followed by a crinkly and finally necrotic appearance of the leaves. In plants with 6 to 8 leaves PVY spreads systemically to all leaves above the directly infected one while in elder plants -depending on the number of leaves at the time of infection -the first to the fourth above the infected leaf does not get infected (unpublished observation). The expression of PAR-1 transcripts was studied after treatment of tobacco plants with PVY from 2 to 12 days after infection (dpi). Samples were taken for RNA analysis as well as for detection of PVY by the ELISA technique from the directly infected as well as from the systemic noninfected and infected leaves. Four days after mechanical treatment of leaves with PVY a weak induction of the PAR-1 transcripts could be observed (Fig. 5a, lane 3) . Transcript levels increased up to 9 dpi (Fig. 5a, lanes 3-8) . A moderate accumulation of transcripts was also found in the systemically uninfected leaves (Fig. 5b,  lanes 7-9) . At no time virus could be detected in these leaves using monoclonal antibodies against PVY coat protein or by hybridizing northern blots with cDNA encoding PVY coat protein (data not shown). Systemic leaves which got infected accumulated high levels of PAR-1 transcripts starting 8 dpi (Fig. 5c, lanes 7-9) . PVY coat protein could be detected 2 dpi after PVY treatment in locally infected leaves and 6 dpi in systemically infected leaves. The data prove that the PAR-1 transcripts are inducible by virus both locally and systemically. The expression of the PAR-1 transcripts in response to PVY occurred co-ordinately with the expression of mRNAs encoding PR-Q and SAR8.2 (data not shown).  To find out whether the two differently sized PAR-1 transcripts were due to the expression of homologous genes the original ppa-1 cDNA library was screened with the PAR-1 cDNA fragment. Out of several hundred hybridizing plaques 25 independent clones were purified and after in vivo excision analysed by restriction and sequencing. According to their homology the cDNAs (between 0.6 and 1 kb in length) could be grouped into three different classes (termed PAR-la, b, c). The first two classes (a and b) shared 90.6~o homology on the DNA level, while both groups were less related to class c (75.2~o and 70.5~o homology, respectively). The three different cDNAs contained one common open reading frame which would code for a protein with a theoretical molecular mass of ca. 20 kDa. Comparisons between the putative coding regions of the three PAR-1 proteins essentially reflected the degree of similarity found on the DNA level. PAR-la and PAR-Ib proteins would be identical to 90.3 ~o while they would share only 78.1 ~o and 79~o identical amino acids with the PAR-lc pro-tein, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the proteins deduced from the open reading frames of the three different PAR cDNAs have been aligned in Fig. 6 . The DNA homology in the putative coding region of the three PAR proteins is significantly higher than in the surrounding untranslated regions (data not shown) which additionally argues for this open reading frame as being the coding region. All three PAR proteins have the same hydrophilic profile with a hydrophobic stretch of 28 amino acids at the Nterminus which resembles a signal peptide. It seems likely that the three PARs are targetted into the secretory pathway. To discriminate between the differently sized PAR-1 transcripts DNA fragments were isolated from the putative 3'-untranslated regions of the three PAR-1 cDNAs. These were used as probes in northern blots to analyse the accumulation of PAR-1 mRNAs in infected and uninfected leaves of PVY-treated tobacco plants. As shown in Fig. 7 , PAR-la (lanes 5-8) and PAR-lc cDNA fragments (lanes 9-12) differentially hybridized to the 1.2 kb and 1.0 kb mRNA transcript, respectively. For comparison, the same blot was hybridized with the full-length PAR-la probe under low-stringent conditions (Fig. 7, lanes 1-4) . The PAR-lb cDNA fragment resulted in a very weak constitutive signal after 2 days exposure. PAR-la and c transcripts were induced both in infected and uninfected leaves of PVY-treated plants (Fig. 7 ). Plants are faced with photoassimilate accumulation in their cells in a number of natural conditions like elevated levels of atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deficiency, freezing, cold and osmotic stress. To study long-term adaptation ofgene expression to sugar accumulation we used transgenic photoassimilate-accumulating tobacco plants (ppa-1) [27] as a model system. The strategy was to isolate cDNA clones by differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcript present in the sugaraccumulating ppa-1 plants. In order to avoid cDNA artifacts frequently resulting from PCR amplifications during the establishment of a subtractive library a novel strategy was employed (Fig. 1) . cDNA libraries were prepared from mRNAs of wild-type and ppa-1 plants allowing the in vivo amplification of the respective cDNAs. The eDNA library prepared from mRNA of ppa-1 plants was cut with the same restriction enzyme later used for establishment of the subtractive library. On the other hand, the eDNA of the library prepared from mRNA of wild-type plants was excluded from cloning because a different restriction enzyme was used. The exclusion of wild-type eDNA cloning allowed for only one round of subtraction with an enrichment for ppa-l-specific cDNAs by 10-fold. Thus this efficient and simple procedure eliminated the need for multiple rounds of hybridizations/subtractions and subsequent PCR amplifications. By differential screening of the subtractive library 12 different cDNAs were isolated of which four could be identified as encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-oxidase (ACC oxidase) and three different PR-proteins (PR-lb, PR-Q and SAR8.2). Two cDNAs were found to be homologous to a Calmodulin-like protein from Arabidopsis and the human ribosomal protein L19 [ 17] . The remaining six did not show similarities to sequences in the databanks. • One of these unknown cDNAs (termed PAR-1 for photoassimilate-responsive) hybridized to mRNAs of about 1.0 and 1.2 kb. The steadystate levels of PAR-1 transcripts in leaves increased in the order from upper to lower leaves both in wild-type and ppa-1 plants thus being correlated with the levels of endogenous sugars (Fig. 2) [27, 9] . In ppa-1 plants which accumulate much higher levels of soluble sugars as compared to wild-type plants [27, 9] , PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated to higher levels. These correlations strongly indicate that the induction of PAR-1 mRNA may be mediated by an increase in soluble sugars in the plant cells. This assumption has further been supported by the finding that wild-type leaves floated on different concentrations of glucose and sucrose also accumulated high levels of PAR-1 transcripts (Fig. 3) . Thus the accumulation of PAR-1 eDNA by soluble sugars appears to be the cause for its isolation as a photoassimilate-responding gene. By rescreening the ppa-1 cDNA library using PAR-1 as a probe 25 independent cDNAs were isolated and characterized. By comparison of their respective DNA sequences the cDNAs could be grouped into three different classes of which the first two (PAR-la and b) were 90.6~o homologous while they were less related to the third-group PAR-lc (75.2~o and 70.5 ~o homologous, respectively). PAR-la and PAR-lc transcripts were found to be strongly inducible by salicylate in floating experiments and were furthermore shown to accumulate in uninfected and infected leaves of tobacco plants treated with PVY ( Fig. 4, 5, 7 ). By these characteristics the PAR-1 cDNAs may be classified as cDNAs encoding a novel class of pathogenesis-related proteins. The PAR-1 cDNAs would code for proteins with a theoretical molecular mass of 20 kDa which could be targetted into the secretory pathway due to an N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 6) . Different sets of PR proteins are known to be induced under a number of stress conditions like viral infection, pathogen invasion, injury, UV light, ozone, chemical treatment, salicylic acid, ethylene and other plant hormones ( [ 3] ; reviewed in [19] ). Thus the accumulation of at least four different PR proteins under conditions where the plant cells permanently meet high levels of sugars and osmotic stress might have been expected. However, PR proteins have attracted attention mainly for their roles in host/pathogen relationships, particularly for their possible involvement in inducing resistance against further development of virus disease in tobacco leaves. Less consideration has been attributed to PR protein function in response to other physiological conditions like osmotic stress. Nevertheless, Pierpoint et al. [22] and Ohashi and Matsuoka [18] reported on the induction of PR proteins under mannitolinduced osmotic stress. Osmotin, a protein which belongs to the group 5 of PR proteins, had first been studied in cultured tobacco cells osmotically adapted to low water potential [25, 26] . Under comparable osmotic conditions, namely floating leaves on sorbitol and PEG, accumulation of PAR-1 mRNAs was not induced (Fig. 4) . Thus the induction of PAR-1 transcripts in wildtype leaves upon floating on osmolytes cannot be solely attributed to osmotic effects. Penetrating and possibly metabolizable solutes such as sucrose and glucose (Fig. 3 ) may be required for the response. The question arises how the induction of the PAR-1 mRNAs is mediated and whether there might be induction mechanisms common to other PR protein genes in physiological situations where plants accumulate photoassimilates in their cells. Hypothetically, even the induction of PR proteins by pathogens might follow the same mechanism. Viruses have been described to cause severe perturbations in carbohydrate metabolism in leaves leading to the accumulation of starch [32 and references therein] and/or soluble sugars [36, 29] . Sturm and Chrispeels [31 ] found that bacterial infection caused rapid induction of extracellular invertase which hydrolyses extracellular sucrose. Glucose and fructose may be taken up which might trigger the induction response. Sugars have also been reported to induce other stress-related proteins, such as proteinase inhibitor II [ 10, 11] , cathepsin D inhibitor and leucine aminopeptidase from potato [unpublished data] and chalcone synthase [33] . Thus, as already suggested by J ang and Sheen [8] , there might be a common mechanism of sugar sensing in the repression of photosynthetic genes and the activation of stressrelated/pathogenesis-related genes. As the induction of PAR and PR protein-specific transcripts in the ppa-1 plants might be mediated by salicylate we have determined salicylate levels in these plants. There was no difference in the levels of salicylic acid or its conjugate between ppa-1 and wild-type plants (Ph. Meuwly, J.-P. M&raux, unpublished data). This indicates that the accumulation of PR protein-specific transcripts by soluble sugars follows a salicylate-independent pathway. Other or additional mechanisms for the induction of PR proteins in the photoassimilateaccumulating plants cannot be ruled out. For instance, the accumulation of the mRNA coding for ACC oxidase might indicate a role of ethylene in the induction process. This is supported by the finding that carbohydrates stimulate ethylene production in tobacco leaf discs [21] . Current experiments are devoted to studies on the signal transduction mechanisms of stressrelated as well as photosynthetic genes in ppa-1 and other transgenic sugar-accumulating plants (manuscript in preparation).",
         "A simplified procedure for the subtractive cDNA cloning of photoassimilate-responding genes: isolation of cDNAs encoding a new class of pathogenesis-related proteins. Transgenic tobacco plants (ppa-1) constitutively expressing Escherichia coli pyrophosphatase behind the 35S CaMV promoter accumulate high levels of soluble sugars in their leaves [27]. These plants were considered a tool to study adaptation of leaves to photoassimilate accumulation at the molecular level. By differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in the transgenic plants 12 different cDNAs were isolated. By sequence analysis four cDNAs could be identified as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-oxidase and as three different pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-1b, PR-Q and SAR 8.2). Two cDNAs were homologous to a calmodulin-like protein from Arabidopsis and a human ribosomal protein L19 while six cDNA clones remained unknown. One of these clones (termed PAR-1 for photoassimilate-responsive) displayed features similar to pathogenesis-related proteins: Hybridizing transcripts, 1.2 and 1.0 kb in length, were strongly inducible by salicylate and accumulated in tobacco plants after infection with potato virus Y (PVY) both in infected and uninfected systemic leaves. PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated in wildtype leaves upon floating on glucose and sucrose whereas sorbitol and polyethylene glycol had no effect. Rescreening of the ppa-1 cDNA library with the PAR-1 cDNA as probe resulted in 25 hybridizing cDNAs which by homology were found to fall into three classes (PAR-1a, b, c). The cDNAs coding for PAR-1a and b were 90.6% homologous on the DNA level while both were less related to the PAR-1c cDNA (70.5% and 75.2% homologous, respectively). One open reading frame was identified in all three PAR-1 cDNA classes. Translation would result in proteins with a theoretical molecular mass of about 20 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequences resemble a signal peptide which would direct the proteins to the secretory pathway. Using selective 3′ hybridization probes of the three PAR-1 cDNAs it was possible to discriminate the different transcripts. Both PAR-1a and PAR-1c mRNAs are induced in plants treated with PVY.. Plants are confronted with sugar accumulation in their leaf mesophyll cells if their photoassimilate production exceeds their utilization in sink tissues. This situation may arise when they are exposed to high light, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and/or when they suffer from sink limitations as under nitrogen deficiency or cold stress [34] . As a result of sugar accumulation the rate of sucrose synthesis decreases, starch accumulates and photosynthesis is inhibited. In contrast to the well studied biochemical mechanisms in response to sugar accumulation the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Systems used to cause an increase of assimilates in photosynthetically active plant cells are girdling (cold or hot wax collar, respectively) of source leaves, the removal of sink tissues and sugar feeding experiments using detached leaves, cell suspension cultures or protoplasts [6, 12, 13, 24] . All these experimental systems, however, are restricted to investigations of the short-term response to sugar accumulation. An alternative to study long-term adaptation of plant cells to elevated levels of sugars would be the use of transgenic plants. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing E. coli pyrophosphatase behind the constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter (ppa-1 plants) accumulate high levels of carbohydrates in their source leaves [27, 9] . These biochemical changes have been explained to be due to increased sucrose synthesis and inhibited loading of sucrose into the phloem [27, 15, 5] . In addition to the expected biochemical alterations in plant metabolism caused by the E. coli transgene a number of other phenotypical changes were observed in the transgenic tobacco plants. The high sugar levels in the source leaves lead to an increase in turgor pressure by a factor of about 9 in the transgenic as compared to wild-type plants while the water potential was essentially not changed [28] . Presumably as a consequence of the elevated turgor, the mesophyll cell enlarged two-fold as compared to wild-type cells and cell walls were found to contain 14~o and 43~o more pectin and uronic acids, respectively [28] . To study the long-term adaptation of gene expression of plants that are continuously confronted with high levels of endogenous soluble sugars we have chosen the transgenic ppa-1 plants as a tool. Here we describe the cloning and description of cDNAs from a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in the sugaraccumulating ppa-1 plants. An efficient and simpined procedure for the establishment of subtractive cDNA libraries will be presented. One of the cDNAs that could not be identified by sequence homology will be characterized in more detail and is suggested to code for a new class of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins). Standard procedures were used for recombinant DNA work [23] . Bacterial transformation were done into E. coli XLl-blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen plant material [ 16] . Poly(A) RNA was isolated by means of oligo(dT) cellulose type 7 (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) RNA was prepared from source leaves of wildtype and ppa-1 plants. 5/zg were transcribed into double-stranded cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit from Pharmacia. Eco RI-Not I adaptors (Pharmacia) were ligated to the cDNAs which were then cloned into Eco RI-digested 2ZAP II vector arms (Stratagene). After in vitro packaging using the Gigapack II packaging extract (Stratagene) recombinant lambda DNA was transfected into E. coli XL1-Blue cells (Strategene) and the titer of the cDNA libraries determined by counting the plaques. Thereafter the cDNA libraries were amplified according to the amplification protocol of Stratagene. The preparation of the subtractive library is schematically drawn in Fig. 1 . The wild-type and the ppa-1 cDNA libraries prepared as described above were in vivo excised according to the in vivo excision protocol of Stratagene. Obtained bacterial colonies were ampfified and their recombinant plasmid DNA isolated using standard procedures. 200 ktg of the wild-type plasmid cDNA library was digested with Not I while plasmids of the ppa-1 cDNA library were cut with Eco RI. cDNA fragments were then separated in agarose gels and fragments between 0.5 kb and 1.5 kb eluted. Wild-type cDNA was photobiotinylated (Clontech) according to the protocol by Strauss and Ausubel [30] . Photobiotinylated wild-type cDNA and ppa-1 cDNA fragments were mixed in a ratio 10:1, denatured at 95 °C and renatured by slowly decreasing the temperature to 25 °C. Avidin (Vectrex Avidin) was added to the mixture and wild-type and hybrid cDNA molecules removed by centrifugation. PPa-1 enriched cDNA fragments were cloned into EcoRI-digested 2ZAP II vector arms, packaged, transfected into XLl-blue cells, the titer determined and the subtractive cDNA library amplified as described above. Screening of cDNA libraries followed the DNA screening protocol by Stratagene. DNA of 2 x 104 plaque-forming units of the subtractive library were transferred onto nylon filters (Hybond N, Amersham Buchler) and hybridized to radioactively labelled wild-type cDNA. Hybridizing phage DNAs were visualized by autoradiography before the filters were hybridized to radioactively labelled ppa-1 cDNA. After autoradiographic exposure the two autoradiographies were compared to identify phage DNAs specific to ppa-1. Purified clones were in vivo excised and characterized by sequencing. Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun NN was obtained from Vereinigte Saatzuchten AG (Ebstorf, Germany). The transgenic ppa-1 tobacco plants have been described [27] .  Total RNA was denatured in 40% formamide, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose, 15% formaldehyde) and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond N; Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany). If not otherwise stated, membranes were hybridized at 42 °C in a buffer containing polyethylene glycol and 25 ~o formamide [1 ] . Radioactive labelling of DNA probes was performed using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Filters were washed three times for 20 min at 42 °C w i t h 2 x S S C ( I × SSC is 0.15 M NaC1, 0.015 M sodium citrate). Radioactive probes for screening the subtractive library were prepared as follows: 0.5 #g mRNA of wildtype and ppa-1 plants, respectively, were transcribed into double-stranded cDNA (cDNA synthesis kit, Pharmacia). This cDNA was radioactively labelled using the random primed DNA labeling kit as described above. PVY N was obtained from the Bundesanstalt far Ztichtungsforschung an Kulturpflanzen (Aschersleben, Germany). Leaves of infected tobacco plants were homogenized in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (ca. 1 g leaf material in 20 ml buffer) to obtain viral extract. Leaves to be infection were dusted with carborundum (SIC) and the viral extract applied by gently rubbing the upper face of the respective leaves with a pistil. A few minutes later the treated leaves were rinsed with water. Mature source leaves were used to apply the viral extract. 8 to 12 days after infection symptoms appeared on the plants. Plant material was homogenized with PB S buffer [23] containing 0.05% Tween-20, 2% polyvinylpyrollidone 25000, 0.2~o bovine serum albumin (1 g plant material/20 ml buffer). Serial dilutions of homogenized extract were analysed by means of the 'Double Antibody Sandwich' test using monoclonal antibodies against PVY (Bioreba, Reinach, Schweiz). The ELISA procedure was performed accordir/g to the protocol by Bioreba. In order to get ppa-l-specific cDNA clones a subtractive library enriched for transcripts present in ppa-1 plants was prepared ( Fig. 1) . RNA was isolated from ppa-l-10 plants which is the best characterized ppa-1 plant line [27] . To avoid multiple cycles of subtraction with subsequent PCR amplification as developed by Straus and Ausubel for genomic subtraction [30] , the subtractive eDNA library was made by only one cycle of subtraction with subsequent selective cloning of transcripts from ppa-1 plants (Fig. 1 ). To this end the recombinant plasmids of the original cDNA libraries made from mRNA of wild-type and ppa-1 plants, respectively, were digested with different restriction enzymes, i.e. wild-type cDNA with Not I and ppa-1 cDNA with Eco RI. The respective cDNAs were eluted from agarose gels and the wild-type cDNA fragments were then photobiotinylated and hybridized to the ppa-1 cDNA. After addition of avidin wild-type as well as hybrid cDNAs were removed by centrifugation. The remaining cDNA fragments -already enriched for ppa-1 clones -were inserted into the Eco RI restriction site of the 2ZAP II vector thereby excluding the cloning of Not I-digested wild-type cDNAs. By hybridizing the same number of plaque-forming units of the subtractive library and the original ppa-1 cDNA library with the E. coli pyrophosphatase DNA (present only in the transgenic ppa-1 plants) it was found that this procedure had resulted in a ten-fold increase of ppa-1-specific clones in the subtractive library. The main advantage of this method is that amplification of the library in vivo largely excludes artifacts which are commonly found in PCRamplified cDNA libraries. One step of subtraction was performed in order not to lose cDNA clones which are only moderately induced in ppa-1 plants. homologous to the ribosomal protein L19 from man [14] while the remaining six could not be identified by sequence homologies in the databanks. Because of their responsiveness to sugar accumulation in the transgenic ppa-1 plants these cDNAs were designated PAR (1 to 6) which stands for photoassimilate-responsive genes. To get a clue about possible functions we started to analyse the expression pattern of one of the isolated unknown cDNA clones (PAR-l). In ppa-l-10 plants the steady-state RNA levels hybridizing to this unidentified cDNA increased in the order from sink to source leaves (Fig. 2b , lanes 1 to 6) which are characterized by increasing sugar levels in the same order [27] . Much weaker hybridization signals were detected in source leaves of wild-type plants (Fig. 2a, lane 6) . Signal strengths in leaves of ppa-1 plants were approximately four times more intense than in the corresponding leaves of wild-type plants as deter-Isolation of ppa-l-specific cDNA from the subtractive library by differential screening The subtractive library was successively hybridized to radioactively labelled cDNA prepared from mRNA of wild-type and ppa-1 plants. 12 differentially hybridizing clones were purified and sequenced. By homology to known sequences four cDNAs could be identified as coding for 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid oxidase [7] and for three different pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins), PR-lb [4] , PR-Q [20] and SARS.2 [35] . The DNA sequence of one cDNA clone shares homology with a calmodulinlike protein from Arabidopsis [2] and one is mined using a phosphoimager. The results were confirmed by analysing RNA from two other independent ppa-1 lines (ppa-l-5 and ppa-l-30) [27] . The unknown cDNA which was 950 bp in length hybridized to two mRNA transcripts being ca. 1.2 kb and 1.0 kb in length. Because the accumulation of transcript levels appeared to be correlated with corresponding steady-state levels of soluble sugar (Fig. 2) we wondered whether the m R N A transcripts would accumulate in wild-type leaves upon incubation with soluble sugars. Leaf discs from mature leaves of wild-type tobacco plants were therefore floated on water, glucose and sucrose (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mM) for 24 h and the RNA was analysed (Fig. 3) . The PAR-1 m R N A transcripts accumulated in response to sucrose at a concentration of 200 mM and levels increased with higher concentrations of sucrose (Fig. 3, lanes 8-14) . Floating on glucose at concentrations of 200 mM to 500 mM also lead to accumulating levels of PAR-1 mRNA although less strongly (Fig. 3,  lanes 1-7) . At a glucose concentration of 500 mM levels of PAR-I transcripts had increased 12-fold while floating on sucrose resulted in an increase of about 29-fold compared to the water control as quantified by phosphoimaging. There are multiple ways by which sugars may possibly exert their effect on gene expression. They might mediate the inducing response by being the effector molecules themselves. Alternatively, the water household may be perturbed (osmotic potential, water potential and resulting turgor pressure) or metabolic changes such as alterations in the C/N ratio may occur in response to sugar accumulation. Alternatively, sugars might induce a state of general stress resulting in changed levels of phytohormones which would regulate gene expression. To study whether the accumulation of PAR-1 transcripts was due to osmotic effects caused by an increase in the levels of soluble sugars, leaf discs were incubated in different osmolytes and the RNA was analysed. Sorbitol at concentrations of 80 and 250 mM (measured to correspond to 98 and 260 mmol/ kg), did not cause PAR-1 transcript accumulation in floating experiments (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and  4) . These concentrations were used as they were about equal in osmolality to 50 mM and 200 mM glucose (measured to be 84 and 247 mmol/kg, respectively). As expected, floating on 200 mM glucose resulted in the accumulation of PAR-1 transcripts (Fig. 4, lane 2) . No induction was observed after floating leaf discs on 7 ~o polyethylene glycol 6000 (Fig. 4, lane 5) . Altogether the data suggest that the induction of the PAR-1 transcripts by glucose and sucrose cannot be caused by osmotic changes alone. Glutamine used in floating experiments to perturb the cellular C/N ratio by increasing the level of amino acids did not lead to enhanced levels of PAR-1 transcripts either (Fig. 4, lane 6) . As cDNAs coding for PR-proteins had been isolated from the ppa-l-specific library supporting the hypothesis that sugar accumulation in leaves would result in a general stress response we wondered whether PAR-1 also possessed any features of stress-related genes. To this end the expression of the PAR-1 transcripts was studied in response to hormones associated with stress in plants by means of floating experiments (Fig. 4) . No substantial differences in transcript levels were observed after floating leaf discs on water, methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid (Fig. 4 , lanes 8 to 10)whereas levels of PAR-1 transcripts rose significantly as a result of floating leaf discs on 1 mM salicylate for 24 h (Fig. 4, lane 7) . Floating leaves on gibberellic acid and indole acetic acid as well as spraying plants with ethephon did not induce PAR-1 transcripts (data not shown).  Because of their induction by salicylate the levels o f m R N A transcripts corresponding to the PAR-1 cDNA were analysed in response to virus infection. To this end tobacco plants cv. Samsun NN were infected with PVY which on this cultivar gives rise to systemic infections (unpublished data). First symptoms of infected leaves are the browning of veins which is followed by a crinkly and finally necrotic appearance of the leaves. In plants with 6 to 8 leaves PVY spreads systemically to all leaves above the directly infected one while in elder plants -depending on the number of leaves at the time of infection -the first to the fourth above the infected leaf does not get infected (unpublished observation). The expression of PAR-1 transcripts was studied after treatment of tobacco plants with PVY from 2 to 12 days after infection (dpi). Samples were taken for RNA analysis as well as for detection of PVY by the ELISA technique from the directly infected as well as from the systemic noninfected and infected leaves. Four days after mechanical treatment of leaves with PVY a weak induction of the PAR-1 transcripts could be observed (Fig. 5a, lane 3) . Transcript levels increased up to 9 dpi (Fig. 5a, lanes 3-8) . A moderate accumulation of transcripts was also found in the systemically uninfected leaves (Fig. 5b,  lanes 7-9) . At no time virus could be detected in these leaves using monoclonal antibodies against PVY coat protein or by hybridizing northern blots with cDNA encoding PVY coat protein (data not shown). Systemic leaves which got infected accumulated high levels of PAR-1 transcripts starting 8 dpi (Fig. 5c, lanes 7-9) . PVY coat protein could be detected 2 dpi after PVY treatment in locally infected leaves and 6 dpi in systemically infected leaves. The data prove that the PAR-1 transcripts are inducible by virus both locally and systemically. The expression of the PAR-1 transcripts in response to PVY occurred co-ordinately with the expression of mRNAs encoding PR-Q and SAR8.2 (data not shown).  To find out whether the two differently sized PAR-1 transcripts were due to the expression of homologous genes the original ppa-1 cDNA library was screened with the PAR-1 cDNA fragment. Out of several hundred hybridizing plaques 25 independent clones were purified and after in vivo excision analysed by restriction and sequencing. According to their homology the cDNAs (between 0.6 and 1 kb in length) could be grouped into three different classes (termed PAR-la, b, c). The first two classes (a and b) shared 90.6~o homology on the DNA level, while both groups were less related to class c (75.2~o and 70.5~o homology, respectively). The three different cDNAs contained one common open reading frame which would code for a protein with a theoretical molecular mass of ca. 20 kDa. Comparisons between the putative coding regions of the three PAR-1 proteins essentially reflected the degree of similarity found on the DNA level. PAR-la and PAR-Ib proteins would be identical to 90.3 ~o while they would share only 78.1 ~o and 79~o identical amino acids with the PAR-lc pro-tein, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the proteins deduced from the open reading frames of the three different PAR cDNAs have been aligned in Fig. 6 . The DNA homology in the putative coding region of the three PAR proteins is significantly higher than in the surrounding untranslated regions (data not shown) which additionally argues for this open reading frame as being the coding region. All three PAR proteins have the same hydrophilic profile with a hydrophobic stretch of 28 amino acids at the Nterminus which resembles a signal peptide. It seems likely that the three PARs are targetted into the secretory pathway. To discriminate between the differently sized PAR-1 transcripts DNA fragments were isolated from the putative 3'-untranslated regions of the three PAR-1 cDNAs. These were used as probes in northern blots to analyse the accumulation of PAR-1 mRNAs in infected and uninfected leaves of PVY-treated tobacco plants. As shown in Fig. 7 , PAR-la (lanes 5-8) and PAR-lc cDNA fragments (lanes 9-12) differentially hybridized to the 1.2 kb and 1.0 kb mRNA transcript, respectively. For comparison, the same blot was hybridized with the full-length PAR-la probe under low-stringent conditions (Fig. 7, lanes 1-4) . The PAR-lb cDNA fragment resulted in a very weak constitutive signal after 2 days exposure. PAR-la and c transcripts were induced both in infected and uninfected leaves of PVY-treated plants (Fig. 7 ). Plants are faced with photoassimilate accumulation in their cells in a number of natural conditions like elevated levels of atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deficiency, freezing, cold and osmotic stress. To study long-term adaptation ofgene expression to sugar accumulation we used transgenic photoassimilate-accumulating tobacco plants (ppa-1) [27] as a model system. The strategy was to isolate cDNA clones by differential hybridization of a subtractive library enriched for transcript present in the sugaraccumulating ppa-1 plants. In order to avoid cDNA artifacts frequently resulting from PCR amplifications during the establishment of a subtractive library a novel strategy was employed (Fig. 1) . cDNA libraries were prepared from mRNAs of wild-type and ppa-1 plants allowing the in vivo amplification of the respective cDNAs. The eDNA library prepared from mRNA of ppa-1 plants was cut with the same restriction enzyme later used for establishment of the subtractive library. On the other hand, the eDNA of the library prepared from mRNA of wild-type plants was excluded from cloning because a different restriction enzyme was used. The exclusion of wild-type eDNA cloning allowed for only one round of subtraction with an enrichment for ppa-l-specific cDNAs by 10-fold. Thus this efficient and simple procedure eliminated the need for multiple rounds of hybridizations/subtractions and subsequent PCR amplifications. By differential screening of the subtractive library 12 different cDNAs were isolated of which four could be identified as encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-oxidase (ACC oxidase) and three different PR-proteins (PR-lb, PR-Q and SAR8.2). Two cDNAs were found to be homologous to a Calmodulin-like protein from Arabidopsis and the human ribosomal protein L19 [ 17] . The remaining six did not show similarities to sequences in the databanks. • One of these unknown cDNAs (termed PAR-1 for photoassimilate-responsive) hybridized to mRNAs of about 1.0 and 1.2 kb. The steadystate levels of PAR-1 transcripts in leaves increased in the order from upper to lower leaves both in wild-type and ppa-1 plants thus being correlated with the levels of endogenous sugars (Fig. 2) [27, 9] . In ppa-1 plants which accumulate much higher levels of soluble sugars as compared to wild-type plants [27, 9] , PAR-1 transcripts also accumulated to higher levels. These correlations strongly indicate that the induction of PAR-1 mRNA may be mediated by an increase in soluble sugars in the plant cells. This assumption has further been supported by the finding that wild-type leaves floated on different concentrations of glucose and sucrose also accumulated high levels of PAR-1 transcripts (Fig. 3) . Thus the accumulation of PAR-1 eDNA by soluble sugars appears to be the cause for its isolation as a photoassimilate-responding gene. By rescreening the ppa-1 cDNA library using PAR-1 as a probe 25 independent cDNAs were isolated and characterized. By comparison of their respective DNA sequences the cDNAs could be grouped into three different classes of which the first two (PAR-la and b) were 90.6~o homologous while they were less related to the third-group PAR-lc (75.2~o and 70.5 ~o homologous, respectively). PAR-la and PAR-lc transcripts were found to be strongly inducible by salicylate in floating experiments and were furthermore shown to accumulate in uninfected and infected leaves of tobacco plants treated with PVY ( Fig. 4, 5, 7 ). By these characteristics the PAR-1 cDNAs may be classified as cDNAs encoding a novel class of pathogenesis-related proteins. The PAR-1 cDNAs would code for proteins with a theoretical molecular mass of 20 kDa which could be targetted into the secretory pathway due to an N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 6) . Different sets of PR proteins are known to be induced under a number of stress conditions like viral infection, pathogen invasion, injury, UV light, ozone, chemical treatment, salicylic acid, ethylene and other plant hormones ( [ 3] ; reviewed in [19] ). Thus the accumulation of at least four different PR proteins under conditions where the plant cells permanently meet high levels of sugars and osmotic stress might have been expected. However, PR proteins have attracted attention mainly for their roles in host/pathogen relationships, particularly for their possible involvement in inducing resistance against further development of virus disease in tobacco leaves. Less consideration has been attributed to PR protein function in response to other physiological conditions like osmotic stress. Nevertheless, Pierpoint et al. [22] and Ohashi and Matsuoka [18] reported on the induction of PR proteins under mannitolinduced osmotic stress. Osmotin, a protein which belongs to the group 5 of PR proteins, had first been studied in cultured tobacco cells osmotically adapted to low water potential [25, 26] . Under comparable osmotic conditions, namely floating leaves on sorbitol and PEG, accumulation of PAR-1 mRNAs was not induced (Fig. 4) . Thus the induction of PAR-1 transcripts in wildtype leaves upon floating on osmolytes cannot be solely attributed to osmotic effects. Penetrating and possibly metabolizable solutes such as sucrose and glucose (Fig. 3 ) may be required for the response. The question arises how the induction of the PAR-1 mRNAs is mediated and whether there might be induction mechanisms common to other PR protein genes in physiological situations where plants accumulate photoassimilates in their cells. Hypothetically, even the induction of PR proteins by pathogens might follow the same mechanism. Viruses have been described to cause severe perturbations in carbohydrate metabolism in leaves leading to the accumulation of starch [32 and references therein] and/or soluble sugars [36, 29] . Sturm and Chrispeels [31 ] found that bacterial infection caused rapid induction of extracellular invertase which hydrolyses extracellular sucrose. Glucose and fructose may be taken up which might trigger the induction response. Sugars have also been reported to induce other stress-related proteins, such as proteinase inhibitor II [ 10, 11] , cathepsin D inhibitor and leucine aminopeptidase from potato [unpublished data] and chalcone synthase [33] . Thus, as already suggested by J ang and Sheen [8] , there might be a common mechanism of sugar sensing in the repression of photosynthetic genes and the activation of stressrelated/pathogenesis-related genes. As the induction of PAR and PR protein-specific transcripts in the ppa-1 plants might be mediated by salicylate we have determined salicylate levels in these plants. There was no difference in the levels of salicylic acid or its conjugate between ppa-1 and wild-type plants (Ph. Meuwly, J.-P. M&raux, unpublished data). This indicates that the accumulation of PR protein-specific transcripts by soluble sugars follows a salicylate-independent pathway. Other or additional mechanisms for the induction of PR proteins in the photoassimilateaccumulating plants cannot be ruled out. For instance, the accumulation of the mRNA coding for ACC oxidase might indicate a role of ethylene in the induction process. This is supported by the finding that carbohydrates stimulate ethylene production in tobacco leaf discs [21] . Current experiments are devoted to studies on the signal transduction mechanisms of stressrelated as well as photosynthetic genes in ppa-1 and other transgenic sugar-accumulating plants (manuscript in preparation).",

         "Recent observations revealed a novel role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R) in lung injury, thereby extending knowledge about the functions of the angiotensin system. Angiotensin II, whose target is the AT1R, is a potent vasoconstrictor. Accordingly, an imbalance leading to enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis is postulated to contribute to both circulatory disturbances and lung injury. In this context, a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, AT1R A1166C, which leads to enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been postulated as a candidate susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke. The aim of our study was to investigate its occurrence in ischemic stroke and to analyze its possible synergistic associations with clinical risk factors. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. Alone, the AT1R 1166C allele did not pose a risk of stroke. In hypertensive smokers, however, it was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR 22.3, 95% CI 5.8–110.2, p<0.001). Further subgroup analysis revealed the same association for both small-vessel (OR 24.3, 95% CI 6.1–121.1, p<0.001) and large-vessel (OR 21.3, 95% CI 4.6–81.1, p<0.001) infarction. On a pathophysiological basis, our results suggest the possibility that the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might give rise to ischemic stroke indirectly via an unfavorable effect on the cardiorespiratory function.",

         "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, which binds the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), is a potent vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of cardiac growth Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . However, ACE2 converts angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7 Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) , which has functions opposite those of angiotensin II, acting as a potent vasodilator and a repressor of cardiac growth (Ferreira and Santos, 2005; Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Recent papers have raised the possibility that an elevated level of angiotensin II and an enhanced activity of AT1R might be associated with lung injury Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Hence, an imbalance leading to enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis might contribute to both circulatory disturbances and lung damage. The ACE D/D polymorphism associated with an elevated angiotensin II level has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of ischemic stroke, indicating genetic involvement in the affected function of the RAS (Szolnoki et al., 2002 (Szolnoki et al., , 2003 Um et al., 2003) . In this context, a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, AT1R A1166C, which leads to enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been postulated as a candidate susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke, cardiovascular events, and hypertension (Hindorff et al., 2002; Treszl et al., 2003; Fukazawa et al., 2004; Kobashi et al., 2004; Rubattu et al., 2004; Sugimoto et al., 2004) . A direct role of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism in ischemic stroke has not been proved, although its unfavorable effect is strongly suggested (Rubattu et al., 2004) . The aims of the present study were to investigate the occurrence of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism in ischemic stroke and to analyze its possible synergistic association with clinical risk factors (smoking and hypertension), which might also be associated indirectly with lung disorders. The data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke who had never suffered a previous stroke event were analyzed. These subjects had been admitted to our Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology between January 1998 and January 2004 after being examined by an internist in the local emergency unit or by a family physician at their homes. All 308 subjects underwent detailed clinical scrutiny, including medical history, family history, an evaluation of vascular risk factors, general physical and neurological examinations, urine analysis, extensive laboratory examinations, electrocardiography, extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography of the brain-supplying arteries, transthoracic and/or transesophageal echocardiography, where appropriate, and MRI examinations within 2 d after the onset of symptoms. All scans were read by an experienced investigator without knowledge of the clinical and laboratory data. The patients were enrolled immediately after the clinical neurological and MRI examinations. Subjects on whom MRIs could not be recorded or for whom the examined clinical parameters and risk factors could not be obtained with certainty in consequence of some technical cause or death were excluded from the study groups. Patients with atrial fibrillation were also excluded to make the study groups more homogenous. Following evaluation of the clinical and radiological features, the patients were enrolled into three subgroups: Group 1 corresponded to large-vessel infarction (cortical or cerebellar lesions and/or brain stem infarcts or subcortical hemispheric infarcts >1.5 cm in diam. on the MRIs, with a cerebral cortical impairment, or brain stem or cerebellar dysfunction); group 2 corresponded to small-vessel occlusion (one or more subcortical hemispheric or brain stem infarcts <1.5 cm in diam. on the MRIs, with one of the features of the traditional clinical lacunar syndrome and without cerebral cortical dysfunction); and group 3 corresponded to a mixed vascular pathology (one or more lacunar and large-vessel infarcts on the MRIs). This classification, based on the clinical and radiological features, was considered to be the most exact and quantifiable method with regard to the requirement that the subgroups reflect the main well-defined vascular pathologies and their overlapping, which might possibly be affected by the mutations examined. As a control group, 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free Caucasian Hungarian subjects were examined. The controls were randomly selected by using a sex-matched technique from general practice registers from the same locality as the stroke cases, with the requirement that they had negative brain MRI or CT findings to avoid silent brain infarctions. They were healthy and believed to be free of cerebrovascular disease. Subjects with any previous clinical data suggesting a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event (such as TIA or angina pectoris) were excluded from the control group. Both controls and patients gave their informed consent to the clinical workup and the DNA analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Smoking and drinking habits and the presence of hypertension or diabetes mellitus were recorded in all groups. Serum cholesterol level, serum triglyceride level, platelet count, and hematocrit were also measured and analyzed as important clinical parameters. Hypertension was diagnosed when blood pressure repeatedly exceeded 140 mmHg systolic and/or 85 mmHg diastolic, or when the patient was taking antihypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed when the glucose level was at least 7.78 mmol/L in a fasting state and/or at least 11.11 mmol/L 2 h after a meal or 75 g oral glucose loading, according to World Health Organization criteria (WHO 1985) . Ischemic heart disease was diagnosed when a history of angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction was present or if there was ECG evidence of coronary heart disease. Patients were classified as smokers if they had ever smoked more than five cigarettes per day for at least a year. Patients were considered to be moderately heavy drinkers if they drank 40 g or more per day. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms, divided by the square of the height in meters. Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 µL of peripheral blood anticoagulated with EDTA by the desalting method (Miller et al., 1988) . All blood samples were stored at -20 o C until DNA isolation. For AT1R (GenBank accession no. NT 005612) genotyping, a new primer set was constructed. The forward primer was 5′-AAAAGCCAAATC CCACTCAA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CAGGACAAAAGCAGGCTAGG-3′. PCR was performed with an MJ Research PTC-200 thermal cycler. The reaction volume was 50 µL, containing 1 µL of DNA (40-80 ng), 0.2 µmol/L each of the primers, 5 µL of reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl at pH = 9.0, containing 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 ), 200 µM dNTP, and 2 U of Taq polymerase. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 96 o C for 120 s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (96 o C for 30 s), annealing (53 o C for 30 s), and extension (72 o C for 60 s). PCR products were digested with 1.5 U of DdeI (New England Biolabs) at 37°C overnight. The restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination. The AT1R 1166A allele results in 58-and 374-bp fragments, and the AT1R 1166C allele results in 58-, 143-, and 231-bp fragments. The clinical data were expressed as means ± S.D., where appropriate. The differences between the clinical parameters in the stroke group and the controls were assessed by using the χ 2 test or the Mann-Whitney test, where appropriate. The stroke groups were tested versus the control group for the frequencies of the different genotypes and their combinations with the clinical risk factors by the χ 2 test. Logistic regression models were evolved to evaluate the importance of the co-occurrences of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and the significant clinical risk factors in the development of ischemic stroke. The AT1R A1166C polymorphism was coded in the following way: score 1 for both the homozygous and heterozygous status, and 0 for lack of the 1166C allele. For all odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were performed with the statistical package Systat 10 (Chicago, IL) for Windows. Clinical data are listed in Table 1 .The AT1R 1166C allele did not occur more frequently in the stroke groups (large vessel, 51.3%; small vessel, 51.7%; mixed type, 50.7%; overall, 51.3%) than in the controls (52.9%) ( Table 2) . Co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension and smoking was significantly more frequent in the stroke groups (large vessel, 12%; small-vessel, 16.1%; mixed type, 14.1%; overall stroke group, 13.6%) than in the controls (0.7%, p < 0.01) ( Table 2) . The co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension and smoking also enhanced the risk of ischemic stroke (large vessel, adjusted OR 21.3; small vessel, adjusted OR 24.3; mixed vascular type, adjusted OR 20.5; overall, adjusted OR 22.3), as compared with risk caused by the combination of hypertension and smoking (large vessel, adjusted OR 8.1; small vessel, adjusted OR 10.2; mixed vascular type, adjusted OR 10.1; overall, adjusted OR 9.1) ( Table 3) . No synergistic effects were found either between the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and hypertension or between the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and smoking inasmuch as the 288 Szolnoki et al. There is no exact explanation for this additive effect. On a pathophysiological basis, however, both smoking and hypertension lead to endothelial dysfunction and vasoregulation disturbances (Sainani and Maru, 2004; Cheng et al., 2005; Munzel et al., 2005; Schmieder, 2005; Schram and Stehouwer, 2005) . The presence of the AT1R 1166C allele might make the endothelial cell more susceptible to dysfunction. This finding was consistent with the result of Rubattu et al. (2004) , in that the association between the AT1R 1166C allele and ischemic stroke was stronger in the presence of hypertension. Data show that the AT1R 1166C allele is associated with increased angiotensin II responsiveness (van Geel et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2003) . This feature of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might be the molecular basis of its enhancing effect on the endothelial dysfunction caused by hypertension and smoking. The evidence concerning a direct role of the AT1R C1166A presence of the AT1R 1166C allele did not lead to an additional increase in the ORs of hypertension or smoking for ischemic stroke (Table 3) . Likewise, we did not find an association between the AT1R 1166C allele and any other clinical risk factor (data not shown). In our population, we did not find a direct association between the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and ischemic stroke. The AT1R 1166C allele did not increase the risk of stroke in the presence of either hypertension or smoking separately, as compared with the risk of ischemic stroke caused by hypertension and smoking alone. However, the co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele, hypertension, and smoking enhanced the risk of ischemic stroke as compared both with the control group and the risk of ischemic stroke caused by the combination of hypertension and smoking. The subgroup analysis revealed that the interaction between the two clinical risk factors and the AT1R 1166C allele reached a similar extent in all subgroups of stroke. The crude and adjusted ORs demonstrated that the presence of the AT1R 1166C allele increased the risk of ischemic stroke only if the stroke patient was both a smoker and suffered from hypertension. Because no association was found between the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension or smoking alone, an additive interaction might be presumed between the two clinical risk factors and the AT1R 1166C allele. 63.2 ± 11.5 a 53.7 ± 14.8 BMI (kg/m 2 ) 26.9 ± 2.0 a 23.1 ± 3.1 Cholesterol (mmol/L) 6.9 ± 1.5 a 5.2 ± 1.5 Triglycerides (mmol/L) 1.92 ± 0.9 a 1.2 6 ± 0.8 Hematocrit ( Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 28, 2006 mutation in ischemic stroke and hypertension, however, seems to be inconclusive (Hindorff et al., 2002; Agachan et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2003; Sugimoto et al., 2004) . This might be caused by differences in geographic regions of ethnicity. Recent data underline the importance of the enhanced activity of the AT1R in the development of acute lung injury Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . This raises the possibility that a complex cardiorespiratory interplay is involved in the interactions between smoking and hypertension and the AT1R A1166C mutation. The enhanced activity of the AT1R caused by the A1166C mutation might lead to a respiratory malfunction in different distress states Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Hypertension and smoking might rive rise to such a chronic distress state. Therefore, an imbal-ance of the cardiorespiratory function might indirectly increase the probability of the evolution of a stroke attack. In conclusion, the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might lead to ischemic stroke via an imbalance of the complex function of the RAS causing a cardiorespiratory malfunction.

Co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension and smoking was significantly more frequent in the stroke groups (large vessel, 12%; small-vessel, 16.1%; mixed type, 14.1%; overall stroke group, 13.6%) than in the controls (0.7%, p < 0.01) ( Table 2) . The co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension and smoking also enhanced the risk of ischemic stroke (large vessel, adjusted OR 21.3; small vessel, adjusted OR 24.3; mixed vascular type, adjusted OR 20.5; overall, adjusted OR 22.3), as compared with risk caused by the combination of hypertension and smoking (large vessel, adjusted OR 8.1; small vessel, adjusted OR 10.2; mixed vascular type, adjusted OR 10.1; overall, adjusted OR 9.1) ( Table 3) . No synergistic effects were found either between the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and hypertension or between the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and smoking inasmuch as the 288 Szolnoki et al. There is no exact explanation for this additive effect. On a pathophysiological basis, however, both smoking and hypertension lead to endothelial dysfunction and vasoregulation disturbances (Sainani and Maru, 2004; Cheng et al., 2005; Munzel et al., 2005; Schmieder, 2005; Schram and Stehouwer, 2005) . The presence of the AT1R 1166C allele might make the endothelial cell more susceptible to dysfunction. This finding was consistent with the result of Rubattu et al. (2004) , in that the association between the AT1R 1166C allele and ischemic stroke was stronger in the presence of hypertension. Data show that the AT1R 1166C allele is associated with increased angiotensin II responsiveness (van Geel et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2003) . This feature of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might be the molecular basis of its enhancing effect on the endothelial dysfunction caused by hypertension and smoking. The evidence concerning a direct role of the AT1R C1166A presence of the AT1R 1166C allele did not lead to an additional increase in the ORs of hypertension or smoking for ischemic stroke (Table 3) . Likewise, we did not find an association between the AT1R 1166C allele and any other clinical risk factor (data not shown). In our population, we did not find a direct association between the AT1R A1166C polymorphism and ischemic stroke. The AT1R 1166C allele did not increase the risk of stroke in the presence of either hypertension or smoking separately, as compared with the risk of ischemic stroke caused by hypertension and smoking alone. However, the co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele, hypertension, and smoking enhanced the risk of ischemic stroke as compared both with the control group and the risk of ischemic stroke caused by the combination of hypertension and smoking. The subgroup analysis revealed that the interaction between the two clinical risk factors and the AT1R 1166C allele reached a similar extent in all subgroups of stroke. The crude and adjusted ORs demonstrated that the presence of the AT1R 1166C allele increased the risk of ischemic stroke only if the stroke patient was both a smoker and suffered from hypertension. Because no association was found between the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension or smoking alone, an additive interaction might be presumed between the two clinical risk factors and the AT1R 1166C allele. 63.2 ± 11.5 a 53.7 ± 14.8 BMI (kg/m 2 ) 26.9 ± 2.0 a 23.1 ± 3.1 Cholesterol (mmol/L) 6.9 ± 1.5 a 5.2 ± 1.5 Triglycerides (mmol/L) 1.92 ± 0.9 a 1.2 6 ± 0.8 Hematocrit ( Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 28, 2006 mutation in ischemic stroke and hypertension, however, seems to be inconclusive (Hindorff et al., 2002; Agachan et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2003; Sugimoto et al., 2004) . This might be caused by differences in geographic regions of ethnicity. Recent data underline the importance of the enhanced activity of the AT1R in the development of acute lung injury Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . This raises the possibility that a complex cardiorespiratory interplay is involved in the interactions between smoking and hypertension and the AT1R A1166C mutation. The enhanced activity of the AT1R caused by the A1166C mutation might lead to a respiratory malfunction in different distress states Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Hypertension and smoking might rive rise to such a chronic distress state. Therefore, an imbal-ance of the cardiorespiratory function might indirectly increase the probability of the evolution of a stroke attack. In conclusion, the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might lead to ischemic stroke via an imbalance of the complex function of the RAS causing a cardiorespiratory malfunction.

         "With recent technical advances in molecular engineering, plants have been investigated increasingly as biological factories for the production of commercially valuable and clinically important recombinant proteins, particularly antigens for vaccines (1-3). Plant-based production systems have the potential to be safe and cost-effective alternatives to the traditional production systems (4). Following the pioneering work on the expression of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen in tobacco plants (5), transgenic approaches have been used to successfully produce several different protein antigens in plants including Norwalk virus capsid protein, heat-labile enterotoxin B, cholera B subunit oligomers, and gastroenteritis coronavirus glycoproteins (3). When the purified proteins or crude leaf extracts were introduced into animals, they were able to elicit immunological responses (6,7), thus supporting the use of plant-based antigens for the development of vaccines. More interestingly, recent studies have shown that antigens produced in plants are able to induce immune responses in animals that are directly fed antigen-containing plant tissues, thereby supporting the feasibility of edible vaccine production (8-10). In addition to stable expression in transgenic plants, several RNA plant viruses have been used successfully to transiently express vaccine antigens in plants (3,11-13). As acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is progressively threatening human lives worldwide, the development of vaccines against the causative agent of this disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is of great importance to human health. The HIV-1 p24 capsid protein is Although several studies have documented the expression of epitopes from HIV-1 gp120 and gp41 in plants using viral vectors (3, 13) , there is only one report on the production of a full-length HIV protein, HIV-1 p24, using tomato bushy stunt virus (21). However, in this system the inserted p24 open reading frame (ORF) was not stably maintained in the viral vector. Toward the development of a stable plant-based production scheme for p24 protein, we have introduced a p24 gene cassette into the genome of tobacco plants using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Our data confirm successful and stable in planta production of p24 and the results support the use of this plant-based expression system for the production of this important antigen of HIV. To clone the p24 ORF into a binary system, the HIV-1 p24 coding region was amplified by PCR using the construct p98-5 (provided by Aventis Pasteur Ltd., Toronto, Canada) as template. The PCR reaction was carried out using a forward primer PG3 that included an NcoI site (underlined) at its 5' end (PG3: 5'-GCGGCCGCCATGGT-ATCAGGTGGTCCTATAGTGCAGAACATC) and a reverse primer PG4 containing an XbaI site (underlined) (PG4: 5'-GGCCCCCTCGAGTCT-AGAGGATCACCCAACTCTTGCCTTATG-GCCGGGTCC). Following amplification with Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) the PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI, and ligated into the expression cassette present in an intermediate plasmid pRTL2. The entire p24 expression cassette, containing cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter with duplicated enhancer (P 35S ), the tobacco etch virus leader (TL) from pTL-7SN, the p24 coding sequence, and the 35S terminator (T 35S ), was released using HindIII and ligated into the HindIII site of a binary plasmid pGA482, thereby generating pGA482-p24 (Fig.  1) . A tri-parental mating system was used to introduce pGA482-p24 into an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1, which harbors a disarmed Ti-plasmid (pGV3850). Tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum var. Burley 21) were cultured on MS medium (22) in Magenta boxes in a growth chamber with 16 h of light (25°C) and 8 h of dark (20°C). Fully expanded leaves were removed from plants, cut into 1 to 2 cm 2 pieces and used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (23). Shoots were generated through organogenesis. Following root induction, plantlets were removed from the culture medium and transferred to soil to grow to maturity in a greenhouse. Genomic DNA was isolated from tobacco plants according to Fedoroff et al. (24) . Ten micrograms of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, separated in a 0.8% Agarose gel, and transferred onto nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham). Randomly labeled probe corresponding to the p24 ORF was generated using Klenow polymerase from the NEBlot kit (New England Biolabs) and was used in Southern hybridizations. Total soluble protein was extracted from 30-40 d old tobacco leaves according to Chong et al. (25) . Briefly, fully expanded leaves were excised from plants. After removal of major veins, leaf materials were immersed in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and ground to fine powder with a pestle. The resultant powder was resuspended (3 mL per g leaf material) in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], and 1% Triton-X 100) and further homogenized with the pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000g for 15 min and the supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloric acid (TCA). The TCA precipitate was solubilized using resuspension buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5] and 2% SDS). Protein content was estimated according to Lowry et al. (26) . For Western blot analysis, soluble protein (20 µg) was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with anti-p24 mouse monoclonal antibody followed by goat anti-mouse Ig (H+L) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the secondary antibody. p24 protein was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using AVP HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay Kit (SAIC Frederick). Microtiter plates precoated with mouse monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 p24 and blocked with 0.5% casein (SAIC Frederick) were used essentially as previously described by the manufacturer (27). Soluble plant protein extracts were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.2% Tween-20 (BDH, Poole, U.K.), added to the microtiter plates, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Washes were performed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA. For p24 detection, wells were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-HIV-1 p24 serum (SAIC Frederick; Lot No. SP451) followed by goat anti-rabbit Ig (H+L) conjugated to HRP (SAIC Frederick; SP524D) as the secondary antibody. 3,3',5, 5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was used for color development. The assay standards were both retrovirus-like particle samples that had been assayed using commercially available p24 assay kit (Coulter, Hialeah,  Eighty-one plants were recovered in the presence of the selectable marker kanamycin following infection of tobacco leaf discs with the Agrobacterium strain carrying the p24 expression cassette. Total DNA was extracted from leaves of regenerants and analyzed using PCR. The screening of eighty-one regenerants using primers flanking the p24 ORF indicated that seventy-nine plants contained the p24 ORF (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA was used to confirm that the p24 gene was integrated into the genome of p24-expressing tobacco plants. A 32 P-labeled probe specific for the p24 sequence detected p24-containing fragments of the predicted size in 18 transgenic lines tested (Fig. 2) , confirming the integration of the p24 gene. To determine whether p24 protein accumulated in the transgenic plants, total soluble protein was extracted from the leaves of lines 14 and 15, representing lines with high and low copies of p24 transgene. Western blot analysis revealed a protein that cross-reacted with a p24-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3) . Compared to the standard HIV p24 protein from virus-like particles (VLP) of mammalian origin, which is free of glyco residues, the plant-derived product displayed a lower migration rate, which corresponded to approx 32 kDa. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of p24 protein using a glycosylation-site-predicting program (29) showed that the 49th amino acid serine and the 124th amino acid threonine of p24 are potential sites for O-glycosylation. Therefore, the reduced migration observed may have resulted from the presence of glyco-residues. Despite possible posttranslational modifications, the plantbased p24 protein was fully reactive with the p24 specific antibody. ELISA was used to quantify the yield of p24 protein. The average yield was approx 3.5 mg per g leaf soluble protein (Table 1 ). This yield is higher than that observed for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (0.1 mg per g leaf soluble protein), but comparable to that of Norwalk virus capsid protein (2.5 mg per g leaf soluble protein), both of which were also produced in transgenic tobacco (5, 7) . No difference in p24 protein accumulation between lines 14 and 15 although Southern analysis indicated significant difference in copy number of p24 transgene (Fig. 2) . To assess the stability of p24 expression in T1 plants, lines 14 and 15 were self-pollinated and the seeds generated were collected and planted. Soluble proteins were extracted from the leaves of T1 plants for both lines. Western blot analysis confirmed the accumulation of p24 protein (data not shown). ELISA analysis showed similar level of p24 protein to those observed for T0 (Table 1) , thus demonstrating that p24 gene is expressed stably in these transgenic lines. In summary, Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer was used to successfully introduce an HIV-1 p24 gene into the genome of tobacco plants and to stably express in planta an antigenically-active form of this viral protein. To our knowledge, the only other in planta expression of a fulllength HIV-1 protein is also of p24 using a tomato bushy stunt virus-based viral vector (21). However, in that case the p24 ORF was not stably maintained in the vector and was deleted within the initially-infected plant.

         "Allergic respiratory disorders, in particular asthma are increasing in prevalence, which is a global phenomenon. Even though genetic predisposition is one of the factors in children for the increased prevalence –urbanisation, air pollution andenvironmental tobacco smoke contribute more significantly. Our hospital based study on 20,000 children under the age of 18 years from 1979,1984,1989,1994 and 1999 in the city of Bangalore showed a prevalence of 9%, 10.5%, 18.5%, 24.5% and 29.5% respectively. The increased prevalence correlated well with demographic changes of the city. Further to the hospital study, a school survey in 12 schools on 6550 children in the age group of 6 to 15 years was undertaken for prevalence of asthma and children were categorized into three groups depending upon the geographical situation of the school in relation to vehicular traffic and the socioeconomic group of children. Group I-Children from schools of heavy traffic area showed prevalence of 19.34%, Group Il-Children from heavy traffic region and low socioeconomic population had 31.14% and Group III-Children from low traffic area school had 11.15% respectively. (P: I & II; II & III < 0.001). A continuation of study in rural areas showed 5.7% in children of 6–15 years. The persistent asthma also showed an increase from 20% to 27.5% and persistent severe asthma 4% to 6.5% between 1994-99. Various epidemiological spectra of asthma in children are discussed here.",

         "The Prevalence of asthma in Asian countries varies between 5.2% in Taipei to 30% in New Zealand and in other countries it is around 10-17 %. There is a substantial evidence that the prevalence is increasing worldwide and the likely causes for the increase or for the variation in prevalence among countries vary. However, there is general agreement that the environmental factors, including increasing exposure to pollution, allergens, western life style of living and environmental tobacco smoke are the major culprits. TM The study in Papua New Guinea where introduction of mites in the indoor environment by using blankets had caused increase prevalence. 1 Synergic action of air pollution, tobacco smoke have been implicated for increase prevalence. 5-7 Western life style of living and insulation of houses are an important cause. 8,9 Polluted cities in Sweden have shown increased prevalence of allergy. ~1 Similar observation have been made in Chile, where school children living in heavily polluted areas present with asthma more than those living in less polluted areas. ~2 In the hospital based study in a general pediatric out patient by Pediatric Pulmonologist on international guidelines on 20,000 children under the age of 18 years in 2 decades from 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994 and 1999 The meteorological data like relative humidity, temperature change at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. and rainfall has not changed much in 20 years. The three major pollens -Casurina, Parthenium and eucalyptus are decreasing in the city in the past 2 decades. The levels of air pollution, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen , suspended particulate matter -10 are much above the permissible levels according to the annual data of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. In continuation of the study we undertook further study in 12 schools on 5570 children in the age group of 6-15 years and 990 rural school children. The urban / rural data were correlated as also the location of schools in relation to traffic and socioeconomic groups (affiuency) to which children belonged and the results are shown in Table I The intermittent asthma/persistent asthma is 80%/20% and 74.3%/25.7% respectively. Further analysing the persistent asthma based on frequency of symptoms, disturbance of sleep and PEF values showed persistent mild 64%, persistent moderate 32% and the persistent severe 4% in 1994. The persistent severe increased from 4% to 6.5% between 1994 to 1999. Age of Onset : Asthma may have its onset at any age: 26.3% of patients are symptomatic by one year of age, one to five years -51.4%; over five years 22.3%. It was observed that in 77.7% the asthma begins in children less than 5 years. Distribution of Sex: The male to female ratio is 64% to 36 % on par with various other studies. Contrary to the well established facts recent observation by Paramesh, Cherian E et al on 119 children of 6-15 years in the year 2001 in the village 6 km away from the main road has shown that girl children suffer more than boys. The male to female ratio is 42%:58%. This is mainly due to the fact that living in ill ventilated houses, use of cow dung cakes and agricultural waste as fuel for cooking and girls always helping the mother to cook in the kitchen lead to airway inflammation and asthma. (Unpublished). Family history: Cooke and Varider Veer in 1916 undertook the first comprehensive study of the inheritance and showed strong genetic component. Studies have shown that monozygotic twins suffer more than dizygotic twins reared together or apart. Our observation on family history reveals that the incidence of asthma in children if one parent in the family is having asthma is 18.79%, in case of one sibling having asthma the incidence is 1.65% and where grandparents have asthma the incidence is 4.12%. a. Viral Infections : Clinical evaluation revealed that in 40% of children the precipitating factor for an asthma attack was viral upper respiratory infection. Parents noticed that the child developed rhinitis with or without fever followed by cough. In these children chest congestion persists over 10 days and often along with wheeze. Other studies show that the incidence varied from 29 to 54% in both atopic and non-atopic individuals. Tissue culture and serologic studies have shown by David Cypcar et al in 1992 that respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) para influenza virus, corona virus and adeno virus were the predominant viruses isolated, is b. Season : Seasonal variation of asthma attacks has been experienced by 35% of children. Of the 35%, during monsoon the incidence was recorded as 75.8%, during winter at 83.3% and during summer at 2.8%. Indian Journal of Pediatrics, Volume 69--April, 2002 c. Food : The role of food allergy in asthma is historically a controversial subject and difficult to prove in children in particular. As observed by the parents and when the suspected food allergen is avoided they seem to do well. We noticed by survey purely history based that 19.75% of children seems to suffer with food related asthma according to parents. The most blamed offenders are as such grapes 57%, banana 53%, guavas 51%, citrus fruit 28%, ice cream 21.5%, fried foods 19%, tomato 12.5% and other food items suspected are less common. d. Aeroallergens : Studies have shown that children develop sensitivity to indoor allergens as they grow older in that atmosphere. Studies have also shown that sensitivity of 1.5% at I year increases to 90% at 8-11 years of age. The predominant indoor allergen is the house dust mite. It takes 100 mites per gram of dust to produce sensitivity and 500 per gram of dust to produce wheezing. Bangalore homes have 4-5 thousand dust mite per gram of dust during high humid months. 50% of perennial asthma is due to dust mites) 7 The pollen and mould sensitivity by skin testing showed only 7.5% in children over 6 years. Cockroach sensitivity was observed in 25% of cases in Bangalore. e. Irritants : Smoke, sprays, burning of mosquito coils, cooking smell are the triggering factors in 6% of children. Study by Cherian E has shown that 41.4% of urban children, 21.86% of rural children smoked their first cigarette in the age group of 10 -17 yrs. Among club going women 36.2% are smokers and they felt it was a status symbol, in comparison to rural agricultural labour class women of whom only 2% were smokers. ~6 Our observation has shown that cigarette smoke as an irritant triggers asthma and has increased from 6% in 1994 to 7.5% in 1999. Thanks to the legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking in public places. f. Pets : Pet ownership by asthmatic children in urban houses is 5% and in rural area it is 7.5%. Among the pets are dogs 89%, cats 38% and birds 11%. We have observed that where pets are more the asthma is less prevalent and where pets are less the asthma is more prevalent. Table 3 can clearly demonstrate our findings and we can conclude that pets are not the major factors for asthma) 9 g. Air Pollution & Asthma : Air pollutants are both Exercise Induced Asthma : A few minutes after the cessation of exercise, there is narrowing of airways which can be proved by decreased forced expiratory flow rate at one second (FEV1). This generally reaches its peak at about 5 to 10 minutes after cessation of exercise and is usually resolved in twenty to thirty minutes as it is due to smooth muscle contraction of airways. We have observed that 55% of asthmatic children experience cough/wheeze after running, crying, shouting. The male to female ratio is 70%:30%. It is essential to identify these factor of exercise induced asthma (EIA) so that proper education of children, parents, teachers and sport authorities can effectively control asthma by proper medications which can be instituted prior to any competitive sport. 7 Allergic respiratory disorders in particular asthma are increasing in the developed and developing countries and pose a serious global health problem and economic burden. Recognising the problem in children is very essential since the spectrum of presentation is variable and multiple, for proper management. Under-diagnosis is very common and under-treatment is equally common. The increased prevalence and severity of asthma in the metropolitan city correlates with environmental pollution, urbanisation and change in the demography of the city. Any economic growth from industrialisation should focus on control of pollution simultaneously.",
         "Epidemiology of asthma in India. Allergic respiratory disorders, in particular asthma are increasing in prevalence, which is a global phenomenon. Even though genetic predisposition is one of the factors in children for the increased prevalence –urbanisation, air pollution andenvironmental tobacco smoke contribute more significantly. Our hospital based study on 20,000 children under the age of 18 years from 1979,1984,1989,1994 and 1999 in the city of Bangalore showed a prevalence of 9%, 10.5%, 18.5%, 24.5% and 29.5% respectively. The increased prevalence correlated well with demographic changes of the city. Further to the hospital study, a school survey in 12 schools on 6550 children in the age group of 6 to 15 years was undertaken for prevalence of asthma and children were categorized into three groups depending upon the geographical situation of the school in relation to vehicular traffic and the socioeconomic group of children. Group I-Children from schools of heavy traffic area showed prevalence of 19.34%, Group Il-Children from heavy traffic region and low socioeconomic population had 31.14% and Group III-Children from low traffic area school had 11.15% respectively. (P: I & II; II & III < 0.001). A continuation of study in rural areas showed 5.7% in children of 6–15 years. The persistent asthma also showed an increase from 20% to 27.5% and persistent severe asthma 4% to 6.5% between 1994-99. Various epidemiological spectra of asthma in children are discussed here..

         "BACKGROUND: As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied the dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed at normal lung condition and different severities of lung injury. METHODS: The experiments were conducted in a hospital isolation room with a pressure of − 5 Pa. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. The jet nebulizer was driven by air at a constant flow rate of 6 L/min, with the mask reservoir filled with sterile water and attached to the HPS via a nebulizer mask. The exhaled leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by high-definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke and droplet particles. FINDINGS: The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mL/min; lung compliance, 70 mL/cm H(2)O), but it increased to 0.54 m in mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H(2)O), and beyond 0.8 m in severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mL/min; lung compliance, 10 mL/cm H(2)O). More extensive leakage through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted with more severe lung injury. INTERPRETATION: Health-care workers should take extra protective precaution within at least 0.8 m from patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology receiving treatment via a jet nebulizer even in an isolation room with negative pressure.",

         " Table I  Visualization of airflow around the nebulizer mask was facilitated by marking air with smoke particles produced by a smoke generator (M-6000, NI9; DS Electronics; Sydney, Australia) as in our previous studies. The oil-based smoke particles, measured < Ium in diameter, are known to follow the airflow pattern precisely with negligible slip. 18 The smoke was introduced continuously to the right main bronchus of the HPS. It mixed with alveolar gas and was then exhaled through the airway. Sections through the leakage jet plume were then revealed by a thin laser light sheet created by a diode-pumped solid stated laser device (OEM UGll-800mW; Lambdapro Technologies; Beijing. China), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light sheet generatton.v-\" The experiments were recorded with a digital video camcorder (Sony High-Definition, HDR-SR8E; Sony; Tokyo, Japan; ClearVid CMOS Sensor, Carl ZeissVario-Sonnar 1'* Lens; Carl Zeiss GmbH; [ena, Germany), with optical resolution of 1,440X 1,080 pixels per video frame. 'I1le laser light sheet (green; wavelength, 532 nm; continuous-wave mode) was adjusted to encompass the hugest Oxygen consumption, mUmin Lung compliance, mUcm HzO Respiratory rate, breaths/min t Tidal volume, mLf MATERIALS AND METHODS breathing, suggesting that aerosols may playa role in the transmission of influenza. There is a strong association between ventilation, environmental air movements, and the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).4 Since respiratory therapy may generate infective aerosols, there is potential risk that treatment may result in a superspreading event among patients and health-care workers in close contact. The use of a jet nebulizer driven by air at 6 Umin for the administration of aerosolized salbutamol in an index patient had probably enhanced the spread of SARS, leading to a major nosocomial outbreak in our hospital in 2003. 5--7 We have reported the dispersion distances of exhaled air, as marked by smoke particles, during application of oxygen therapy via a simple mask and during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).Il-1O As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed to breathe at normal lung condition and at different degrees of lung injury. We hypothesized that as lung compliance deteriorated with worsening lung injury, there would be more extensive leakage through the side vents of the jet nebulizer. The experiments were conducted in an isolation room that measured 2.8 X 4.22 X 2.4 m, with 12 air exchanges per hour (Fig 1) . This is one ofthe 36, double-door, negative pressure (-5 Pa) isolation rooms specifically constructed on the top floor ofthe hospital after the major outbreak of SARS5 to facilitate management of patients with highly infectious diseases. The experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in details in our previous studies 8-10 on exhaled air dispersion related to NPPV and Simple oxygen mask. In this study, we examined the extent of exhaled air leakage through the side vents of the jet nebulizer (Salter Labs; Arvin, CAl attached to a high-fidelity HPS (HPS 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc.; Sarasota, FL). The jet nebulizer had a built-in air pump driven by a constant flow of air at 6 Umin for the purpose of the study. The nebulizer reservoir was filled with sterile water. The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). Lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation, and has been applied in previous studiesI 1-15 to simulate human respiration. The simulator represented a 70-kg adult male sitting on a 45°-inclined hospital bed. In this study, we programmed lung compliance and oxygen consumption of the HPS to mimic three different lung conditions: normal, mild lung injury, and severe lung injury ( Table l)yu7 cross-section of the entire leakage jet plume through the nebulizer side vents alongthe coronal plane lateralto the HPS. nus allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateralto the mask and the patient. All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light sheet were captured by the high-definition video camera positioned at the end of the bed directIy opposite to the HPS.Smoke concentration in the plumewasestimatedfromthe lightscatteredby smoke particles (Fig 2) .8-10 We estimated normalized smoke concentration in the mask leakage air from the light scattered by the particles. In short, the thin laser light sheet of near-constant intensityilluminated smoke particle markers in the mask airflow leakage. Smoke particles scattered laser light perpendicular to the light sheet, and thiswas collected and integrated by the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)video camera element and lens. s -IO This analysis was based on scattered light intensity being proportional to particle concentration under the special conditionsof constant intensity laser light sheet illumination and monodisperse, small (submicrometer) particles.IS The motion video of several breathing cycles for a given lung model setting was captured to a computer and individualframes extractedas gray scalebitmaps for intensityanalysis. Frames were extracted at times corresponding to the beginning of inspiration to generate an ensemble averagefor the correspondinginstant of the respiratorycycle. s-IO The largest spread of contours from the nebulizer mask was chosen, and this was found to be at approximately the mid-time of the respiratory cycle. All gray scale frames were read into a program specifically developed for this study (MathCad 8.0; Mathsoft; Cambridge, MA),19 along with background intensity images taken with the laser switched off. The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame pixel by pixel to remove any stray FIGURE 2. A jet nebulizer was attached to a high-fidelity HPS with a laser Iiliht sheet shining from the left side of the simulator at the coronal plane. The simulator represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45°-inclinedhospital bed and was programmed to breathe spontaneously. 650 background light. and the pixel intensity values were averaged over all frames to determine the ensemble averaged intensity. The resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light sheet by the smoke particles and was directIy proportional to smoke concentration. The imagewas normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate nonnalizedparticleconcentration contours. S -IO The leakagejet plume consistsof a combinationof pulmonary smoke and the aerosolized medication. The leakage plume of \"unused\" aerosolized medications from the jet nebulizer should also be considered as infective because it mixeswith the exhaled air before it escapes through the side vents of the nebulizer mask. As the smoke particles mark air that originates from the HPS airways, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering exhaled air and the aerosolizedmedication around the patient that has come from within the mask and/or the patient's respiratory system. The smoke concentration contours are made up of data collected from 10 breaths. A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consistsentirelyof air exhaled by the patient, where there is a veryhighchance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the mask exhaust vents.A valuenear 0 indicates no measurable air leabgein the regionand a smallchanceof exposure to the exhaled air. 8 -10 The study received nonionizing radiation and biologicallchemical safety approval bythe Chinese University of Hong Kong. As the exhalation smoke jet was noted to leak through the side vents of the nebulizer mask, we therefore presented the lateral distances of air particle dispersion with reference to the coronal plane (Fig 3, top left) . The dispersion distances increased with worsening lung injury. At normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mUmin; lung compliance, 70 mUcm H 2 0 ), the average respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min and tidal volume was 700 mL. The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles, defined as the boundary with a region encountering < 5% concentration of exhaled smoke particles (light blue contour), was 0.45 m, whereas the dispersion distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (white and red zone and above) was 0.2 m (Fig 3, top right) . In mild lung injury (oxygenconsumption, 300 mUmin; lung compliance, 35 mUcm H 2 0 ; respiratory rate, 25 breaths/ min; tidal volume, 300 mL), the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of smoke particles increased to 0.54 m, whereas that of a high concentration was 0.15 m (Fig 3, bottom left) . In severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mUmin; lung compliance, 10 mUcm H 2 0 ; respiratory rate, 40 breaths/min; tidal volume, 150 mL), a larger and more diffuse exhalation jet leaked through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted, probably due to its gravitational effect. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (eg, red zone on scale) was < 0.1 m, the maximum dispersion distance extended beyond Original Research The white color code and the red color code represented regions consisting of 100% and 70%, respectively, of smoke particles, whereas the background of the isolation room (deep blue code) was free of smoke particles. Bottom lett: The simulator was programmed to mimic mild lung injury with oxygen consumption of 300 mUmin, lung compliance of 35 mUcm H 20, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 300 mL. The maximum exhalation distance of a lowconcentration of smokeparticles iJicreased to 0.54 m, whereasthat of a high concentration was 0.15 m. Bottom right: The simulator was programmed to mimic severelung injurywith oxygen consumption of 500 mUmin, l~compliance of 10 mUcm H 2 0 , respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 150 mL. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (red zone) was < 0.1 m, that of a low concentration of smoke particles was noted to extendbeyond0.8 m as a result of more extensive leakage throughthe nebulizersideventsof the nebulizermask, with a projectile shape due to gravitational effect. 0.8 m due to more extensive leakage through the nebulizer side vents (Fig 3, bottom right) . DISCUSSION With an extremely fine smoke particle tracer in order to demonstrate the maximum distribution of exhaled air, this study investigated the dispersion distances of exhaled air particles during application of a jet nebulizer under normal lung condition vs www.chestjoumal.org different degrees of lung injury in our hospital isolation room with negative pressure. Using laser smoke visualizationmethods, we have shown that the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of air particles increased from 0.45 m at normal lung condition to 0.54 m and beyond 0.8 m during mild and severe lung injury, respectively. Interestingly, the dispersion of high-concentration smoke particles was reduced with worsening lung injury. These data suggest that the dispersion of exhaled air during application of jet nebulizer is determined by both the CHEST /135/3/ MARCH, 2009 expiratory effort and the leakage of \"unused\" aerosolized droplets through the exhalation ports of the jet nebulizer. In this regard, exhaled air from the lungs contained high concentration of smoke particles and was dispersed according to expiratory flow. Therefore, the dispersion distance of high-concentration smoke particles was significantly reduced by > 40% as the tidal volume was decreased from 700 to 150 mL. In contrast, the extent of leakage ofaerosolized droplets was inversely proportional to the tidal volume. Although aerosol deposition within the simulated patient does not model deposition within a real lung, much of the aerosolized medication was deposited within the simulated patient during inspiration, and the amount of leakage was therefore less in normal lung condition than in the severe lung injury model. Although the leakage of aerosolized droplets carried only small amount of exhaled smoke particles, these were responsible for dispersing Iowconcentration smoke particles to a longer distance in severe lung injury. These findings have important clinical implications to the hea1th-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure and febrile illness of unknown etiology at a close distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for health-care workers in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections. The jet nebulizer is an aerosol-generating device commonly used to deliver aerosolized bronchodilation to patients with airway diseases and pneumonia. It was implicated as the cause of a major hospital outbreak of SARS in 2003.5--7 While the major routes for transmission of SARS were related to infected droplets and fomites, as is usually the case in viral pneumonia,20 there was evidence that SARS might have spread by airborne transmission. 21 -24 It was not entirely clear if different modalities of respiratory support had contributed to the nosocomial outbreaks of SARS through generation of infective aerosols. Our previous studies 9 • 10 have shown that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distances from patients receiving oxygen via a Hudson mask and during NPPV were 0.4 m and 0.45 m, respectively. A case-control study25 involving 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong has identified SARS patients requiring oxygentherapy or NPPVas independent risk factors for superspreading nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. Our previous study9 has shown an exhaled air dispersion distance of 0.22 m from the simple oxygen mask when oxygen was delivered at 6 Umin to the HPS with mild lung injury. The current study has shown that the jet nebulizer system driven by air at 6 Umin can extend the dispersion distance much further, especially in the presence of more severe lung injury ( Table 2) . Apart from aerosol-generating procedures, environmental factors such as medical ward airflow and ventilation play a significant role in the aerosol transmission of infection in health-care premises.\" A recent review4 has demonstrated a strong association between ventilation, air movements in buildings, and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, influenza, and SARS, but there are insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. In a stud y 27 of the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with ceilingmixing type ventilation system, the small droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size S 45 J.Lm) behaved as airborne transmittable particles (staying airborne for > 360 s) and the dispersions were strongly affected by the ward ventilation airflow pattern. The expiratory droplets exhibited an initial rapid dispersion followed by slower dispersion in the subsequent stage. In contrast, large droplets (with initial size This study has applied smoke particles as markers for exhaled air in the HPS model because there is no safe and reliable marker that can be introduced into human lungs for study.8-10 The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air droplet two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they travel. However, evaporation of water content in some respiratory droplets during the jet nebulizer therapy would produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets would fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway due to gravitational effects. A droplet nucleus is the airborne residue of a potentially infectious aerosol from which most of the liquid has evaporated and may have diameter < 10~m.4.26 Asthe smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours are referring to exhaled air and droplet nuclei (including the aerosolized medication) rather than the risk of large droplet transmission.sJ? However, we could not capture the full air-dispersion distance in severe lung injury because we were unable to position the laser team far away from the HPS due to the small size of the isolation room. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, respiratory droplets are released. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to patients infected with H5Nl influenza, the World Health Organization 28 currently recommends airborne precautions in health-care facilities, including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5Nl influenza in isolation rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) during aerosol-generating procedures due to the high lethality of the disease and uncertainty about the mode of human-to-human transmission. The negative pressure room will reduce the spread of airborne contamination between rooms. The air-exchange rate and airflow patterns are important factors in the control of airborne virus infection, and good ventilation arrangement may enhance the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.P? In health-care facilities where negative pressure isolation room is not available, an alternative is to administer bronchodilator to high-risk patients in the form of a metered-dose inhaler via a spacer or in dry powder formulation because these methods have equivalent efficacy to the jet nebulizer in relieving bronchospasm due to acute asthma. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] In summary, this study has shown that substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs at least within 0.8 m from patients receiving treatment via a jet nebulizer www.chelItjoumal.org in an isolation room with negative pressure. Healthcare workers should take special precautions when caring for patients with febrile respiratory illness requiring treatment via a jet nebulizer.",
         "Exhaled Air and Aerosolized Droplet Dispersion During Application of a Jet Nebulizer. BACKGROUND: As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied the dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed at normal lung condition and different severities of lung injury. METHODS: The experiments were conducted in a hospital isolation room with a pressure of − 5 Pa. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. The jet nebulizer was driven by air at a constant flow rate of 6 L/min, with the mask reservoir filled with sterile water and attached to the HPS via a nebulizer mask. The exhaled leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by high-definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke and droplet particles. FINDINGS: The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mL/min; lung compliance, 70 mL/cm H(2)O), but it increased to 0.54 m in mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H(2)O), and beyond 0.8 m in severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mL/min; lung compliance, 10 mL/cm H(2)O). More extensive leakage through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted with more severe lung injury. INTERPRETATION: Health-care workers should take extra protective precaution within at least 0.8 m from patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology receiving treatment via a jet nebulizer even in an isolation room with negative pressure..  Table I  Visualization of airflow around the nebulizer mask was facilitated by marking air with smoke particles produced by a smoke generator (M-6000, NI9; DS Electronics; Sydney, Australia) as in our previous studies. The oil-based smoke particles, measured < Ium in diameter, are known to follow the airflow pattern precisely with negligible slip. 18 The smoke was introduced continuously to the right main bronchus of the HPS. It mixed with alveolar gas and was then exhaled through the airway. Sections through the leakage jet plume were then revealed by a thin laser light sheet created by a diode-pumped solid stated laser device (OEM UGll-800mW; Lambdapro Technologies; Beijing. China), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light sheet generatton.v-\" The experiments were recorded with a digital video camcorder (Sony High-Definition, HDR-SR8E; Sony; Tokyo, Japan; ClearVid CMOS Sensor, Carl ZeissVario-Sonnar 1'* Lens; Carl Zeiss GmbH; [ena, Germany), with optical resolution of 1,440X 1,080 pixels per video frame. 'I1le laser light sheet (green; wavelength, 532 nm; continuous-wave mode) was adjusted to encompass the hugest Oxygen consumption, mUmin Lung compliance, mUcm HzO Respiratory rate, breaths/min t Tidal volume, mLf MATERIALS AND METHODS breathing, suggesting that aerosols may playa role in the transmission of influenza. There is a strong association between ventilation, environmental air movements, and the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).4 Since respiratory therapy may generate infective aerosols, there is potential risk that treatment may result in a superspreading event among patients and health-care workers in close contact. The use of a jet nebulizer driven by air at 6 Umin for the administration of aerosolized salbutamol in an index patient had probably enhanced the spread of SARS, leading to a major nosocomial outbreak in our hospital in 2003. 5--7 We have reported the dispersion distances of exhaled air, as marked by smoke particles, during application of oxygen therapy via a simple mask and during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).Il-1O As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed to breathe at normal lung condition and at different degrees of lung injury. We hypothesized that as lung compliance deteriorated with worsening lung injury, there would be more extensive leakage through the side vents of the jet nebulizer. The experiments were conducted in an isolation room that measured 2.8 X 4.22 X 2.4 m, with 12 air exchanges per hour (Fig 1) . This is one ofthe 36, double-door, negative pressure (-5 Pa) isolation rooms specifically constructed on the top floor ofthe hospital after the major outbreak of SARS5 to facilitate management of patients with highly infectious diseases. The experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in details in our previous studies 8-10 on exhaled air dispersion related to NPPV and Simple oxygen mask. In this study, we examined the extent of exhaled air leakage through the side vents of the jet nebulizer (Salter Labs; Arvin, CAl attached to a high-fidelity HPS (HPS 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc.; Sarasota, FL). The jet nebulizer had a built-in air pump driven by a constant flow of air at 6 Umin for the purpose of the study. The nebulizer reservoir was filled with sterile water. The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). Lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation, and has been applied in previous studiesI 1-15 to simulate human respiration. The simulator represented a 70-kg adult male sitting on a 45°-inclined hospital bed. In this study, we programmed lung compliance and oxygen consumption of the HPS to mimic three different lung conditions: normal, mild lung injury, and severe lung injury ( Table l)yu7 cross-section of the entire leakage jet plume through the nebulizer side vents alongthe coronal plane lateralto the HPS. nus allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateralto the mask and the patient. All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light sheet were captured by the high-definition video camera positioned at the end of the bed directIy opposite to the HPS.Smoke concentration in the plumewasestimatedfromthe lightscatteredby smoke particles (Fig 2) .8-10 We estimated normalized smoke concentration in the mask leakage air from the light scattered by the particles. In short, the thin laser light sheet of near-constant intensityilluminated smoke particle markers in the mask airflow leakage. Smoke particles scattered laser light perpendicular to the light sheet, and thiswas collected and integrated by the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)video camera element and lens. s -IO This analysis was based on scattered light intensity being proportional to particle concentration under the special conditionsof constant intensity laser light sheet illumination and monodisperse, small (submicrometer) particles.IS The motion video of several breathing cycles for a given lung model setting was captured to a computer and individualframes extractedas gray scalebitmaps for intensityanalysis. Frames were extracted at times corresponding to the beginning of inspiration to generate an ensemble averagefor the correspondinginstant of the respiratorycycle. s-IO The largest spread of contours from the nebulizer mask was chosen, and this was found to be at approximately the mid-time of the respiratory cycle. All gray scale frames were read into a program specifically developed for this study (MathCad 8.0; Mathsoft; Cambridge, MA),19 along with background intensity images taken with the laser switched off. The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame pixel by pixel to remove any stray FIGURE 2. A jet nebulizer was attached to a high-fidelity HPS with a laser Iiliht sheet shining from the left side of the simulator at the coronal plane. The simulator represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45°-inclinedhospital bed and was programmed to breathe spontaneously. 650 background light. and the pixel intensity values were averaged over all frames to determine the ensemble averaged intensity. The resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light sheet by the smoke particles and was directIy proportional to smoke concentration. The imagewas normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate nonnalizedparticleconcentration contours. S -IO The leakagejet plume consistsof a combinationof pulmonary smoke and the aerosolized medication. The leakage plume of \"unused\" aerosolized medications from the jet nebulizer should also be considered as infective because it mixeswith the exhaled air before it escapes through the side vents of the nebulizer mask. As the smoke particles mark air that originates from the HPS airways, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering exhaled air and the aerosolizedmedication around the patient that has come from within the mask and/or the patient's respiratory system. The smoke concentration contours are made up of data collected from 10 breaths. A contour value of 1 indicates a region that consistsentirelyof air exhaled by the patient, where there is a veryhighchance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the mask exhaust vents.A valuenear 0 indicates no measurable air leabgein the regionand a smallchanceof exposure to the exhaled air. 8 -10 The study received nonionizing radiation and biologicallchemical safety approval bythe Chinese University of Hong Kong. As the exhalation smoke jet was noted to leak through the side vents of the nebulizer mask, we therefore presented the lateral distances of air particle dispersion with reference to the coronal plane (Fig 3, top left) . The dispersion distances increased with worsening lung injury. At normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mUmin; lung compliance, 70 mUcm H 2 0 ), the average respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min and tidal volume was 700 mL. The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles, defined as the boundary with a region encountering < 5% concentration of exhaled smoke particles (light blue contour), was 0.45 m, whereas the dispersion distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (white and red zone and above) was 0.2 m (Fig 3, top right) . In mild lung injury (oxygenconsumption, 300 mUmin; lung compliance, 35 mUcm H 2 0 ; respiratory rate, 25 breaths/ min; tidal volume, 300 mL), the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of smoke particles increased to 0.54 m, whereas that of a high concentration was 0.15 m (Fig 3, bottom left) . In severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mUmin; lung compliance, 10 mUcm H 2 0 ; respiratory rate, 40 breaths/min; tidal volume, 150 mL), a larger and more diffuse exhalation jet leaked through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted, probably due to its gravitational effect. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (eg, red zone on scale) was < 0.1 m, the maximum dispersion distance extended beyond Original Research The white color code and the red color code represented regions consisting of 100% and 70%, respectively, of smoke particles, whereas the background of the isolation room (deep blue code) was free of smoke particles. Bottom lett: The simulator was programmed to mimic mild lung injury with oxygen consumption of 300 mUmin, lung compliance of 35 mUcm H 20, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 300 mL. The maximum exhalation distance of a lowconcentration of smokeparticles iJicreased to 0.54 m, whereasthat of a high concentration was 0.15 m. Bottom right: The simulator was programmed to mimic severelung injurywith oxygen consumption of 500 mUmin, l~compliance of 10 mUcm H 2 0 , respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 150 mL. Although the exhalation distance of a high concentration of smoke particles (red zone) was < 0.1 m, that of a low concentration of smoke particles was noted to extendbeyond0.8 m as a result of more extensive leakage throughthe nebulizersideventsof the nebulizermask, with a projectile shape due to gravitational effect. 0.8 m due to more extensive leakage through the nebulizer side vents (Fig 3, bottom right) . DISCUSSION With an extremely fine smoke particle tracer in order to demonstrate the maximum distribution of exhaled air, this study investigated the dispersion distances of exhaled air particles during application of a jet nebulizer under normal lung condition vs www.chestjoumal.org different degrees of lung injury in our hospital isolation room with negative pressure. Using laser smoke visualizationmethods, we have shown that the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of air particles increased from 0.45 m at normal lung condition to 0.54 m and beyond 0.8 m during mild and severe lung injury, respectively. Interestingly, the dispersion of high-concentration smoke particles was reduced with worsening lung injury. These data suggest that the dispersion of exhaled air during application of jet nebulizer is determined by both the CHEST /135/3/ MARCH, 2009 expiratory effort and the leakage of \"unused\" aerosolized droplets through the exhalation ports of the jet nebulizer. In this regard, exhaled air from the lungs contained high concentration of smoke particles and was dispersed according to expiratory flow. Therefore, the dispersion distance of high-concentration smoke particles was significantly reduced by > 40% as the tidal volume was decreased from 700 to 150 mL. In contrast, the extent of leakage ofaerosolized droplets was inversely proportional to the tidal volume. Although aerosol deposition within the simulated patient does not model deposition within a real lung, much of the aerosolized medication was deposited within the simulated patient during inspiration, and the amount of leakage was therefore less in normal lung condition than in the severe lung injury model. Although the leakage of aerosolized droplets carried only small amount of exhaled smoke particles, these were responsible for dispersing Iowconcentration smoke particles to a longer distance in severe lung injury. These findings have important clinical implications to the hea1th-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure and febrile illness of unknown etiology at a close distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for health-care workers in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections.

         "Patients with respiratory infections often require the use of supplemental oxygen via oxygen masks, which, in the hospital, may become sources of aerosolized infectious pathogens. To assess this risk, a human lung model (respiration rate, 12 breaths/min) was designed to test the potential for a simple oxygen mask at a common setting (4 L/min) to disperse potentially infectious exhaled air into the surrounding area. A laser sheet was used to illuminate the exhaled air from the mask, which contained fine tracer smoke particles.

         "P atients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia often require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or oronasal masks. Usually, there are no additional isolation precautions taken for such patients, and they may be on an open ward with a respiratory infection, breathing with the aid of an oxygen mask that is supplying oxygen at a flow rate of up to 10 L/min. However, little is known about the airflow characteristics of such oxygen delivery devices and their ability to transmit infection by aerosol. This problem of hospital-acquired infection via infectious aerosol was highlighted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics of 2003. 1 Many cases of SARS occurred within hospitals with infections taking place between patients and health-care workers, in some cases apparently assisted by oxygen delivery and other respiratory support devices. 1 Since then, it has been reported that SARS-coronavirus (CoV) RNA can be detected in air, 2 and in some cases airborne SARS CoV can also be grown in culture, demonstrating viability. 3 More recently, avian influenza (influenza H5N1) has led to a high mortality rate in human cases in Thailand and Vietnam. 4, 5 The strongest case implicating person-toperson transmission of influenza H5N1 also occurred in a hospital setting. 6 The potential for long-range, airborne transmission for both influenza 6, 7 and SARS CoV 8 has been reported. Yet, it has been difficult to demonstrate the risk of aerosol transmission of such respiratory infections in the health-care environment, and there are still many serious gaps in our knowledge. 7 In one study, using aerosolized 3% hypertonic saline solution and photographic techniques, Somogyi et al 9 demonstrated that throughout exhalation, both the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type oxygen masks channeled the exhaled gas through side vents, forming a leakage plume of exhaled gas that was directed to either side of the patient. The authors asked the volunteer to hold his breath for approximately 2 s, while the masks were fitted to his face. The volunteer then exhaled smoothly for at least 2 s, during which a series of still photographs were taken. Although the volunteer's breathing action was not physiologic in this study, the authors demonstrated that such oxygen masks could produce potentially infectious plumes from exhaled air that could be inhaled by health-care workers, visitors, and other patients. In order to further assess the potential for oxygen masks to spread infection, we designed a human lung model with a more realistic breathing cycle. In addition, we applied an engineering-based approach to visualize and analyze the airflow images recorded on digital video during simulated respiration with a simple oxygen mask. A high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS) [model 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc; Sarasota, FL], representing a medium-sized adult man sitting on a 45 o -inclined hospital bed, was fitted with a simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner; Taichung Hsien, Taiwan). The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. Oxygen flow was set as 4 L/min, and the simulator was programmed for a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 0.5 L. The mask airflow was visualized by smoke using an M-6000 smoke generator (model N19; DS Electronics; Tempe, AZ). The generated smoke was continuously introduced to the right main bronchus of the HPS as part of the inhaled air. This design allowed the smoke to continuously mix with the alveolar gas and then to be part of the exhaled air, to allow visualization. Initially, the smoke airflow was illuminated with a strong halogen light to reveal the full three-dimensional extent of the mask airflow and the leakage plume. Sections through the plume were then revealed by an intense laser light-sheet created by an Nd:YVO 4 Q-switched, frequency-doubled laser (OEM T20-BL 10 -106Q; Spectra-Physics Lasers; Mountain View, CA), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation (Fig 1) . This was recorded with a three charge-couple device, ϫ48 zoom digital video system (Sony; Tokyo, Japan) at an image rate of 30 Hz. The laser light-sheet was adjusted to encompass the full leakage plume, which was previously identified from the halogen light observations and set at a thickness of approximately 1 to 2 mm. The light-sheet (green, 527-nm wavelength, transverse electromagnetic mode 00 , and 2-W average power) was positioned on one side of the manikin, with the plane of the light-sheet adjusted for the mask to illuminate as much of the smoke cloud as possible. The cross-sectional plane of the leakage plume and sections through it were of interest. The laser could be run in continuous wave mode (100 mW average power), or high-frequency (350 kHz) pulsed mode for pulse intensities up to an average of 2 W. Pulse frequencies of Ͼ 1 kHz were found to be effectively continuous wave for both video and observation by eye. Following the positioning of the laser light-sheet, the video images captured were synchronized with the respiratory cycle by starting the video capture at the exact beginning of breath exhalation. The video recording captured many simulated breath cycles, and the images corresponding to the maximum expired volume during each respiratory cycle were analyzed. Both realtime full-motion video (30 images per second) and snapshot images of the video images were analyzed. Full-motion video was reviewed in real-time using a movie editor (Windows Movie Maker; Microsoft; Richmond, WA), and the best images of respiration showing airflow behavior were analyzed using software that was developed for this study (Matlab 6.5). In order to obtain the clearest boundary of dissemination, image-processing techniques were applied to these images to define the edge of the visible smoke boundary from the captured digital video images (see supplementary material at www.chestnet. org). These techniques were applied to a selected video image that represented the peak of simulated exhalation during one breath cycle by the human simulator. Finally, we assumed that the smoke propagations were symmetric under the symmetric mask structure. This was observed and confirmed during the initial three-dimensional flow visualization using the halogen light. Hence, a symmetric image was constructed (Fig 2) . The final maximum distance traveled by the exhaled smoke plume, using this simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner) with an oxygen flow of 4 L/min, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, and a tidal volume of 0.5 L, was approximately 0.40 m (Fig 2) . It was finally decided to choose the video image/footage of the most clearly illuminated smoke plume, demonstrating the maximum distance traveled at the peak of exhalation for image analysis. The reason for this was one of safety. Such a maximum distance will give added safety if it is used as a guide to the safe distance required for the prevention of hospitalacquired aerosol transmission infections. This distance was defined on the basis of the image analysis technique that was used to smooth and approximate the boundary of the visible smoke on video that had been recorded by the digital camera. The defined boundary of the smoke was based on the reflected light intensity of the smoke particles when illuminated by the laser sheet (see supplementary material for further details). The HPS has been used in medical training, especially in anesthesia, emergency, and critical care medicine. It is also a realistic representation of human respiratory physiology. The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide). The lung compliance and airway resistance respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. It also produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation. A report on the use of an HPS to study complex respiratory physiology has been published previously. 10 -14 There have been a few studies about the production of aerosols from the use of oxygen masks. However, although their methodology was quite different, a useful comparison can still be made with the study by Somogyi et al, 9 who produced images of exhaled airflows using three different oxygen masks on a human volunteer. Their study is not directly comparable to this one mainly because the oxygen masks they used had no oxygen flow supplied. Only the volunteer's natural exhalation after brief breath holding produced the air movement. This is not a natural breathing cycle, and, in this respect, the cyclical respiration pattern in the human lung model presented here may be more realistic. Although Somogyi et al 9 showed images of the behavior of the exhaled air plume, they did not report quantitative data, such as the distance traveled by the visible air plumes shown in their images. However, a closer inspection of their Figure 1A , which illustrates a side plume of exhaled air emitted from a simple nonrebreathing oxygen mask, appears to show that it extends approximately two head diameters away from the mask. The head diameter of an adult has been reported to be approximately 13 to 16 cm. 15 Thus, the extent of the visible plume shown in their Figure 1A can be estimated to be approximately 0.30 m. Furthermore, these authors stated the following: \"The spread of the exhaled gas may be greater than shown, as evaporation and reduction in density of the droplets at the margin of the plume may limit their effectiveness as markers.\" Although the methodology and human lung model parameters used in this study may have been somewhat different (oxygen flow, 4 L/min; respiratory rate, 12 breaths/ min; tidal volume, 0.5 L), the distance traveled (0.40 m) by the exhaled smoke plume in this study seems remarkably similar. There are some limitations that are specific to this study. Most significantly, fine smoke particles rather than droplets were used in this study. This smoke consists of submicrometer m particles that will follow the path of the air flow precisely. 16, 17 Thus, the extent of spread of the smoke is representative of the airflow around the mask. This distance is derived from smoke particles that are visible enough to be analyzed from the digitally captured video images. This will almost certainly be a lower limit approximation as there will be smoke particles traveling beyond the visible boundaries seen in these images. These particles cannot be visualized effectively because there are too few at these distances to scatter sufficient light to be easily detected on the video images. Second, it has been estimated that droplets generated from the upper respiratory tract by, for instance, coughing, sneezing, talking, singing, and breathing, range from 0.5 to 12 m in diameter. 18 As viral and bacterial agents range from approximately 0.020 to 100 m in size, the size of the exhaled droplet will obviously limit the number of such infectious agents that can be carried in each droplet. The majority of naturally produced aerosol droplets are much larger than the smoke particles used in this study. Therefore, most of them will not follow the exhaled airflow perfectly, but will move relatively more slowly horizontally due to their larger size and will fall more quickly under the effects of gravity 19 and thus not travel as far as the smoke particles used in this study. However, some of the smaller droplets exhaled by a human patient may be reduced in size sufficiently by evaporation within the exhaled, oxygen-assisted airflow and remain suspended in air for considerable periods of time. These smaller particles may then more closely be represented by the smoke particles used in this study. Therefore, the boundaries of the smoke cloud indicated in Figure 2 are likely to represent an upper boundary of the distance traveled by real infectious droplets and may therefore be taken as defining a zone of potential aerosol infection with an extra margin of safety. There is no reliable and safe marker that can be introduced into human lungs for study. The use of the human lung model here allows for only one set of parameters to be tested at one time. So, while a healthy human patient would sometimes be breathing quietly, then sometimes talking, coughing, or sneezing (when the mask may be removed), the behavior of this human lung model is unchanging. However, this study allows a baseline estimate of the distance traveled by any potentially infectious aerosols, while the patient is at rest. This study effectively complements that of Somogyi et al 9 and demonstrates that patients with transmissible respiratory infections such as influenza H5N1 and SARS, who are breathing with the aid of oxygen masks, may be a potential source of aerosoltransmitted infection. These patients should, ideally, be managed in a single, isolation room, under nega-tive pressure, though with their relatively high cost, not all health-care institutions may possess such facilities. During the SARS epidemics of 2003, health-care workers managing SARS patients found that they could protect themselves by the effective and consistent use of personal protective equipment, 20 and that the converse was also true. 21 Influenza H5N1 is likely to be a more infectious, transmissible pathogen, 22 so effective, well-informed infection control precautions will be even more important to prevent hospital-acquired infections in both health-care workers and patients.",
         "Airflows Around Oxygen Masks: A Potential Source of Infection. Patients with respiratory infections often require the use of supplemental oxygen via oxygen masks, which, in the hospital, may become sources of aerosolized infectious pathogens. To assess this risk, a human lung model (respiration rate, 12 breaths/min) was designed to test the potential for a simple oxygen mask at a common setting (4 L/min) to disperse potentially infectious exhaled air into the surrounding area. A laser sheet was used to illuminate the exhaled air from the mask, which contained fine tracer smoke particles. An analysis of captured digital images showed that the exhaled air at the peak of simulated exhalation reached a distance of approximately 0.40 m.. P atients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia often require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or oronasal masks. Usually, there are no additional isolation precautions taken for such patients, and they may be on an open ward with a respiratory infection, breathing with the aid of an oxygen mask that is supplying oxygen at a flow rate of up to 10 L/min. However, little is known about the airflow characteristics of such oxygen delivery devices and their ability to transmit infection by aerosol. This problem of hospital-acquired infection via infectious aerosol was highlighted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics of 2003. 1 Many cases of SARS occurred within hospitals with infections taking place between patients and health-care workers, in some cases apparently assisted by oxygen delivery and other respiratory support devices. 1 Since then, it has been reported that SARS-coronavirus (CoV) RNA can be detected in air, 2 and in some cases airborne SARS CoV can also be grown in culture, demonstrating viability. 3 More recently, avian influenza (influenza H5N1) has led to a high mortality rate in human cases in Thailand and Vietnam. 4, 5 The strongest case implicating person-toperson transmission of influenza H5N1 also occurred in a hospital setting. 6 The potential for long-range, airborne transmission for both influenza 6, 7 and SARS CoV 8 has been reported. Yet, it has been difficult to demonstrate the risk of aerosol transmission of such respiratory infections in the health-care environment, and there are still many serious gaps in our knowledge. 7 In one study, using aerosolized 3% hypertonic saline solution and photographic techniques, Somogyi et al 9 demonstrated that throughout exhalation, both the nonrebreathing and Venturi-type oxygen masks channeled the exhaled gas through side vents, forming a leakage plume of exhaled gas that was directed to either side of the patient. The authors asked the volunteer to hold his breath for approximately 2 s, while the masks were fitted to his face. The volunteer then exhaled smoothly for at least 2 s, during which a series of still photographs were taken. Although the volunteer's breathing action was not physiologic in this study, the authors demonstrated that such oxygen masks could produce potentially infectious plumes from exhaled air that could be inhaled by health-care workers, visitors, and other patients. In order to further assess the potential for oxygen masks to spread infection, we designed a human lung model with a more realistic breathing cycle. In addition, we applied an engineering-based approach to visualize and analyze the airflow images recorded on digital video during simulated respiration with a simple oxygen mask. A high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS) [model 6.1; Medical Education Technologies Inc; Sarasota, FL], representing a medium-sized adult man sitting on a 45 o -inclined hospital bed, was fitted with a simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner; Taichung Hsien, Taiwan). The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. Oxygen flow was set as 4 L/min, and the simulator was programmed for a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 0.5 L. The mask airflow was visualized by smoke using an M-6000 smoke generator (model N19; DS Electronics; Tempe, AZ). The generated smoke was continuously introduced to the right main bronchus of the HPS as part of the inhaled air. This design allowed the smoke to continuously mix with the alveolar gas and then to be part of the exhaled air, to allow visualization. Initially, the smoke airflow was illuminated with a strong halogen light to reveal the full three-dimensional extent of the mask airflow and the leakage plume. Sections through the plume were then revealed by an intense laser light-sheet created by an Nd:YVO 4 Q-switched, frequency-doubled laser (OEM T20-BL 10 -106Q; Spectra-Physics Lasers; Mountain View, CA), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation (Fig 1) . This was recorded with a three charge-couple device, ϫ48 zoom digital video system (Sony; Tokyo, Japan) at an image rate of 30 Hz. The laser light-sheet was adjusted to encompass the full leakage plume, which was previously identified from the halogen light observations and set at a thickness of approximately 1 to 2 mm. The light-sheet (green, 527-nm wavelength, transverse electromagnetic mode 00 , and 2-W average power) was positioned on one side of the manikin, with the plane of the light-sheet adjusted for the mask to illuminate as much of the smoke cloud as possible. The cross-sectional plane of the leakage plume and sections through it were of interest. The laser could be run in continuous wave mode (100 mW average power), or high-frequency (350 kHz) pulsed mode for pulse intensities up to an average of 2 W. Pulse frequencies of Ͼ 1 kHz were found to be effectively continuous wave for both video and observation by eye. Following the positioning of the laser light-sheet, the video images captured were synchronized with the respiratory cycle by starting the video capture at the exact beginning of breath exhalation. The video recording captured many simulated breath cycles, and the images corresponding to the maximum expired volume during each respiratory cycle were analyzed. Both realtime full-motion video (30 images per second) and snapshot images of the video images were analyzed. Full-motion video was reviewed in real-time using a movie editor (Windows Movie Maker; Microsoft; Richmond, WA), and the best images of respiration showing airflow behavior were analyzed using software that was developed for this study (Matlab 6.5). In order to obtain the clearest boundary of dissemination, image-processing techniques were applied to these images to define the edge of the visible smoke boundary from the captured digital video images (see supplementary material at www.chestnet. org). These techniques were applied to a selected video image that represented the peak of simulated exhalation during one breath cycle by the human simulator. Finally, we assumed that the smoke propagations were symmetric under the symmetric mask structure. This was observed and confirmed during the initial three-dimensional flow visualization using the halogen light. Hence, a symmetric image was constructed (Fig 2) . The final maximum distance traveled by the exhaled smoke plume, using this simple oxygen mask (HS-3031; Hsiner) with an oxygen flow of 4 L/min, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, and a tidal volume of 0.5 L, was approximately 0.40 m (Fig 2) . It was finally decided to choose the video image/footage of the most clearly illuminated smoke plume, demonstrating the maximum distance traveled at the peak of exhalation for image analysis. The reason for this was one of safety. Such a maximum distance will give added safety if it is used as a guide to the safe distance required for the prevention of hospitalacquired aerosol transmission infections. This distance was defined on the basis of the image analysis technique that was used to smooth and approximate the boundary of the visible smoke on video that had been recorded by the digital camera. The defined boundary of the smoke was based on the reflected light intensity of the smoke particles when illuminated by the laser sheet (see supplementary material for further details). The HPS has been used in medical training, especially in anesthesia, emergency, and critical care medicine. It is also a realistic representation of human respiratory physiology. The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide). The lung compliance and airway resistance respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. It also produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation. A report on the use of an HPS to study complex respiratory physiology has been published previously. 10 -14 There have been a few studies about the production of aerosols from the use of oxygen masks. However, although their methodology was quite different, a useful comparison can still be made with the study by Somogyi et al, 9 who produced images of exhaled airflows using three different oxygen masks on a human volunteer. Their study is not directly comparable to this one mainly because the oxygen masks they used had no oxygen flow supplied. Only the volunteer's natural exhalation after brief breath holding produced the air movement. This is not a natural breathing cycle, and, in this respect, the cyclical respiration pattern in the human lung model presented here may be more realistic. Although Somogyi et al 9 showed images of the behavior of the exhaled air plume, they did not report quantitative data, such as the distance traveled by the visible air plumes shown in their images. However, a closer inspection of their Figure 1A , which illustrates a side plume of exhaled air emitted from a simple nonrebreathing oxygen mask, appears to show that it extends approximately two head diameters away from the mask. The head diameter of an adult has been reported to be approximately 13 to 16 cm. 15 Thus, the extent of the visible plume shown in their Figure 1A can be estimated to be approximately 0.30 m.

         "As a member of the U.S. Congress since 1975, I am proud of my country's record in international health. From the eradication of smallpox to the identification of the SARS virus, from the volunteers of the Peace Corps to the disease detectives of the Epidemiologic Intelligence Service, the United States has invested resources and scientific expertise to save millions of lives across the globe. Today's enormous global health challenges provide new opportunities for the United States to cooperate and to lead. The Administration of President George W. Bush, however, has often failed to do so. On several key issues, the Bush Administration appears to be basing international health policy on the wishes of its ideological and corporate supporters, not on evidence of what works. By the year 2020, tobacco-related diseases will kill an estimated 8. 4 million people annually, more than two-thirds of whom live in developing countries. If current trends continue, more people will die annually from tobacco-related illnesses than from any single disease (Murray,1997) . Despite these dire public health facts, the Bush Administration sided with cigarette manufacturers in negotiations over the world's first public health treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Over two years of talks, the BushAdministration opposed proposals for mandatory tobacco taxes, fought provisions mandating secondhand smoke protections, attempted to weaken proposals to restrict tobacco advertising, and rejected prohibitions on the use of deceptive terms such as 'light'and 'low' (Waxman, 2002) . At one point, the Administration supported ten of eleven deletions that U.S. tobacco company Philip Morris wanted made to the draft treaty text (Waxman, 2001; http://www.house.gov/reform/min/ inves_tobacco/index_accord.htm, accessed 20 February 2004) . When challenged on the science behind its positions, the Administration made several dubious legal arguments, including the false claim that the United States could not accept any treaty provision requiring additional legislation from Congress (Waxman, 2003b; http:// www.house.gov/reform/min/inves_tobacco/index_ accord.htm, accessed 20 February, 2004) . These efforts to weaken the treaty continued throughout the process. Indeed, the Bush Administration sent confidential cables around the world on the eve of the final negotiating session urging that public health considerations not be allowed to trump trade interests in the treaty (Waxman, 2003a; http://www.house.gov/reform/min/ inves_tobacco/index_accord.htm, accessed 20 February 2004). 1 U.S. pressure contributed to a number of changes that weakened the treaty. Even with these changes, and with Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson's eventual support for the treaty, the President may refuse to sign and send it to the Senate for ratification. An internal company e-mail from Philip Morris provides a revealing commentary on the role of the Bush Administration, stating that by the end of the negotiations, the company's positions on the FCTC were actually 'to the left' of those advanced by the United States (Berlind, 2001; http://www.pmdocs.com using document ID 2085780145D, accessed 20 February 2004). The company has contributed more than US $6 million to President Bush and his political party since his election campaign (Center for Responsive Politics, 2004) . It is estimated that over 1 billion adults around the world are overweight, and 300 million are obese (WHO, 2003b; http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/ docs/gs_obesity.pdf, accessed February 20, 2004). Rising obesity rates are causing increases in diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses in developed and developing countries. For two years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has sought to develop a strategy to tackle this problem.Working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, WHO led an expert consultation on diet and nutrition, which was completed in April 2003 (WHO, 2003a) . The consultation report recommends a variety of interventions^including diet modification, exercise, and social policies such as advertising restrictions and taxes^to fight obesity around the world. The Bush Administration, however, has sought to interfere with the report's adoption. Most recently, in comments to WHO, the Administration urged major changes in the report (US Department of Health and Human Services, and US Department of Agriculture, 2004). According to the Administration; the report should not say that fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with less weight gain (despite evidence of such an association) (Epstein, 2001); the report should not suggest that advertising of junk food to children may contribute to obesity (despite evidence that preschool children respond to such advertisements) (Borzekowski, 2001) ; the report should not find that excessive soft drink consumption is linked with obesity (despite evidence of such a link) (Tordoff, 1990; Ludwig, 2001; Mrdjenovic, 2003) . The Bush Administration has also tried to circumscribe the extent to which WHO can address obesity at all. According to the Administration, WHO's role is to provide technical descriptions of scientific evidence, not to recommend social policies such as taxes or advertising restrictions (US Department of Health and Human Services, and US Department of Agriculture, 2004; Steiger, 2004) . These positions are similar to stances taken by the food industry. This industry has contributed more than US $21million to the President's political party since his election campaign (Center  Women's lack of access to education and healthcare contribute to maternal illness and death and high infant mortality rates. Despite extensive scientific evidence in support of comprehensive community-based interventions in reproductive health, the Bush Administration's policy has become fixated on two goals shared by the President's right-wing ideological supporters: (1) opposition to abortion; and (2) promotion of 'abstinence only' education in lieu of comprehensive sex education. The Bush Administration has sought to defund and undermine organizations that provides abortion services. Soon after taking office, President Bush reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy blocking overseas nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funds if the organization either directly or indirectly supports abortion (Global Gag Rule Impact Project, 2003; http://64.2245.182.238/globalgagrule/pdfs/executive_ summary/GGR_exec_summary.pdf, accessed 20 February 2004). The impact of this policy has been devastating. Across the world, previously funded clinics lack supplies, are unable to provide screenings and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV), and can no longer deliver HIV/AIDS education to youth. (Global Gag Rule Impact Project, 2003) . In July 2002, the Administration withdrew U.S. support for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) because of unsubstantiated allegations that the fund supported forced abortions in China (Boucher, 2002; http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/ 2002 /12035.htm, accessed 20 February 2004 Ephron, 2002 . It then stripped funding from organizations affiliated with UNFPA, cutting off essential health services in Angola, Congo, and Rwanda (Swarns, 2003) . During the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in May 2002, the Bush Administration joined with Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and the Vatican to argue that the term 'reproductive health services'should not include legal abortion services (International Women's Health Coalition, 2002 , http://www.iwhc.org/index.cfm?fuseaction ¼ page &pageID ¼ 385, accessed 20 February 2004 Sengupta, 2002) . Domestically, the Bush Administration has consistently argued that teaching 'abstinence only' to teenagers is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, despite scientific evidence to the contrary (Starkman, 2002) . Now the Administration is seeking to export this ideology abroad. In December 2002, at the U.N.-sponsored Asian and Pacific Population Conference, the Bush Administration proposed deleting 'consistent condom use' from a list of methods to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS (Joshi, 2002) . This position contradicts extensive scientific evidence and international consensus supporting the effectiveness of condoms against HIV/AIDS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002; http:www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/latex.htm, accessed 20 February 2004). USAID, 2003) . The Administration's representatives later explained their fear that such a statement might encourage underage sexual activity, a concern that is similarly unsupported by science (Kirby, 2001) . Over 40 million people globally are living with HIV/AIDS, with nearly 30 million in sub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS, 2003; http://www.usaid.gov/ our_work/global_health/aids/TechAreas/condoms/ condomfactsheet.html, accessed 20 February 2004) . In response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, President Bush announced in his January 2003 State of the Union address the 'President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief' (White House, 2003; http:// www. whitehouse. gov/news/releases/2003 http:// www. whitehouse. gov/news/releases/ /01/ 20030129-1.html, accessed 20 February, 2004 . The Plan was described as a five-year initiative to provide US $15 billion, including US $10 billion in new funding, for AIDS treatment, prevention, care, and related activities in the developing world, focusing on twelve African and two Caribbean nations (White House, 2003) . The President's attention to HIV in Africa is welcome. However, there are troubling signs that the Administration's commitment may be waning. First, the Administration has not followed through on its funding promises. Despite congressional authorization for US $3 billion to implement the President's plan, the Administration asked the Congress to appropriate not more than US $2 billion (O'Neill, 2003 ; http://www.globalaidsalliance.org/oneillmemo.html, accessed on 20 February 2004). Only a small fraction of the funding is going to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, threatening the Fund's effectiveness. Second, the Administration has been promoting abstinence as a major component of the President's Plan, diverting focus and funding from comprehensive approaches that have been demonstrated to work. The budget for the plan, as approved by Congress and signed by the President, sets aside one-third of all prevention funds (representing more than US $1 billion) for 'abstinenceuntil-marriage' programs. This includes one-third of all prevention activities, including those that address routes of transmission other than sexual, such as mother-to-child or needle sharing. Third, there are concerns that the Administration may continue to interfere with the ability of poor nations to purchase inexpensive generic HIV/AIDS drugs (Waxman, 2004) . The result could be a needless transfer of funds from AIDS victims to the pharmaceutical industry, a longtime ally of the President. Since the 2000 election cycle, this industry gave over US $40 million to the President's political party (Center for Responsive Politics, 2004) . The Bush Administration is abandoning the long tradition of U. S. leadership on international health issues. On tobacco, nutrition, and reproductive health, the Administration is failing to provide global leadership against scourges that claim millions of lives every year. The President's HIV/AIDS Initiative is at similar risk. Pushing the Bush Administration to change course will not be easy. It will require strong stands by U.S. allies, an outcry from public health professionals in the United States, and a growing public awareness that America's scientific credibility and moral authority hang in the balance. But this change is essential if the United States is to play a constructive role in international public health.",

For two years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has sought to develop a strategy to tackle this problem.Working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, WHO led an expert consultation on diet and nutrition, which was completed in April 2003 (WHO, 2003a) . The consultation report recommends a variety of interventions^including diet modification, exercise, and social policies such as advertising restrictions and taxes^to fight obesity around the world. The Bush Administration, however, has sought to interfere with the report's adoption. Most recently, in comments to WHO, the Administration urged major changes in the report (US Department of Health and Human Services, and US Department of Agriculture, 2004). According to the Administration; the report should not say that fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with less weight gain (despite evidence of such an association) (Epstein, 2001); the report should not suggest that advertising of junk food to children may contribute to obesity (despite evidence that preschool children respond to such advertisements) (Borzekowski, 2001) ; the report should not find that excessive soft drink consumption is linked with obesity (despite evidence of such a link) (Tordoff, 1990; Ludwig, 2001; Mrdjenovic, 2003) . The Bush Administration has also tried to circumscribe the extent to which WHO can address obesity at all. According to the Administration, WHO's role is to provide technical descriptions of scientific evidence, not to recommend social policies such as taxes or advertising restrictions (US Department of Health and Human Services, and US Department of Agriculture, 2004; Steiger, 2004) . These positions are similar to stances taken by the food industry. This industry has contributed more than US $21million to the President's political party since his election campaign (Center  Women's lack of access to education and healthcare contribute to maternal illness and death and high infant mortality rates. Despite extensive scientific evidence in support of comprehensive community-based interventions in reproductive health, the Bush Administration's policy has become fixated on two goals shared by the President's right-wing ideological supporters: (1) opposition to abortion; and (2) promotion of 'abstinence only' education in lieu of comprehensive sex education. The Bush Administration has sought to defund and undermine organizations that provides abortion services. Soon after taking office, President Bush reinstated the so-called Mexico City policy blocking overseas nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funds if the organization either directly or indirectly supports abortion (Global Gag Rule Impact Project, 2003; http://64.2245.182.238/globalgagrule/pdfs/executive_ summary/GGR_exec_summary.pdf, accessed 20 February 2004). The impact of this policy has been devastating. Across the world, previously funded clinics lack supplies, are unable to provide screenings and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV), and can no longer deliver HIV/AIDS education to youth. (Global Gag Rule Impact Project, 2003) . In July 2002, the Administration withdrew U.S. support for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) because of unsubstantiated allegations that the fund supported forced abortions in China (Boucher, 2002; http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/ 2002 /12035.htm, accessed 20 February 2004 Ephron, 2002 . It then stripped funding from organizations affiliated with UNFPA, cutting off essential health services in Angola, Congo, and Rwanda (Swarns, 2003) . During the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in May 2002, the Bush Administration joined with Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and the Vatican to argue that the term 'reproductive health services'should not include legal abortion services (International Women's Health Coalition, 2002 , http://www.iwhc.org/index.cfm?fuseaction ¼ page &pageID ¼ 385, accessed 20 February 2004 Sengupta, 2002) . Domestically, the Bush Administration has consistently argued that teaching 'abstinence only' to teenagers is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, despite scientific evidence to the contrary (Starkman, 2002) . Now the Administration is seeking to export this ideology abroad. In December 2002, at the U.N.-sponsored Asian and Pacific Population Conference, the Bush Administration proposed deleting 'consistent condom use' from a list of methods to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS (Joshi, 2002) . This position contradicts extensive scientific evidence and international consensus supporting the effectiveness of condoms against HIV/AIDS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002; http:www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/latex.htm, accessed 20 February 2004). USAID, 2003) . The Administration's representatives later explained their fear that such a statement might encourage underage sexual activity, a concern that is similarly unsupported by science (Kirby, 2001) . Over 40 million people globally are living with HIV/AIDS, with nearly 30 million in sub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS, 2003; http://www.usaid.gov/ our_work/global_health/aids/TechAreas/condoms/ condomfactsheet.html, accessed 20 February 2004) . In response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, President Bush announced in his January 2003 State of the Union address the 'President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief' (White House, 2003; http:// www. whitehouse. gov/news/releases/2003 http:// www. whitehouse. gov/news/releases/ /01/ 20030129-1.html, accessed 20 February, 2004 . The Plan was described as a five-year initiative to provide US $15 billion, including US $10 billion in new funding, for AIDS treatment, prevention, care, and related activities in the developing world, focusing on twelve African and two Caribbean nations (White House, 2003) . The President's attention to HIV in Africa is welcome. However, there are troubling signs that the Administration's commitment may be waning. First, the Administration has not followed through on its funding promises. Despite congressional authorization for US $3 billion to implement the President's plan, the Administration asked the Congress to appropriate not more than US $2 billion (O'Neill, 2003 ; http://www.globalaidsalliance.org/oneillmemo.html, accessed on 20 February 2004). Only a small fraction of the funding is going to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, threatening the Fund's effectiveness. Second, the Administration has been promoting abstinence as a major component of the President's Plan, diverting focus and funding from comprehensive approaches that have been demonstrated to work. The budget for the plan, as approved by Congress and signed by the President, sets aside one-third of all prevention funds (representing more than US $1 billion) for 'abstinenceuntil-marriage' programs. This includes one-third of all prevention activities, including those that address routes of transmission other than sexual, such as mother-to-child or needle sharing. Third, there are concerns that the Administration may continue to interfere with the ability of poor nations to purchase inexpensive generic HIV/AIDS drugs (Waxman, 2004) . The result could be a needless transfer of funds from AIDS victims to the pharmaceutical industry, a longtime ally of the President. Since the 2000 election cycle, this industry gave over US $40 million to the President's political party (Center for Responsive Politics, 2004) . The Bush Administration is abandoning the long tradition of U. S. leadership on international health issues. On tobacco, nutrition, and reproductive health, the Administration is failing to provide global leadership against scourges that claim millions of lives every year. The President's HIV/AIDS Initiative is at similar risk. Pushing the Bush Administration to change course will not be easy. It will require strong stands by U.S. allies, an outcry from public health professionals in the United States, and a growing public awareness that America's scientific credibility and moral authority hang in the balance. But this change is essential if the United States is to play a constructive role in international public health.",

         "Global health diplomacy involves new forms of collective action and negotiation of new rules and norms to address global health challenges. Traditionally, nation states have dominated these processes, having negotiated internationally to address cross-border health risks since the mid-nineteenth century. 1 Today a diverse group of other non-state actors participate, impelled by the increasing impact of globalisation on health systems and population health. 2 Given the more immediate interdependence and stronger cross-border linkages associated with epidemics, the global health diplomacy agenda remains focused on infectious diseases, virus sample sharing, 3 pandemic flu 4,5 and SARS. 6 With such diseases, the ability of one country to protect the health of its population can directly depend on whether another country has the capacity to detect and respond to mobile, readily transmissible communicable pathogens, and vice versa. y By contrast [to such interdependence], interconnectedness does not involve relationships of mutual dependence among States and, thus, does not provide robust incentives for reciprocal undertakings to lower risks. In global health, interconnectedness is often a feature of non-communicable disease problems. For example, the export by a developed country of processed foods high in added sugars and salts may contribute to the prevalence of childhood or adult obesity in a developing country, but the health, security, and economic well-being of people in the developed country do not depend on whether the developing country controls and reduces the prevalence of obesity in its territory. 7 As emphasis on infectious diseases continues, 8 we concentrate here on an example of global health diplomacy to tackle chronic diseases: the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). In 2006, a technical group of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the WHO 'take the lead in the development of an international code on the commercial promotion of food and beverages to children' (p. 27) to address the rise of obesity in children globally. 9 In anticipation of these negotiations over the global marketing of food to children, we analyse lessons learned from the FCTC for use in diplomatic efforts to prevent diet-related chronic diseases. The FCTC is a treaty negotiated among member states of the WHO during the years 1999-2003. It took effect on 27 February 2005; by November 2009, the signatory countries numbered 168. With more than five million tobacco-related deaths per year, tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death in the world. The FCTC countries committed themselves to raising taxes on tobacco products, regulating packaging and labelling of tobacco products, banning tobacco advertising and promotion, and installing measures to reduce illicit trade in tobacco products and sales to minors. The treaty does not offer a blueprint for the elimination of tobacco use or for the banning of international trade in tobacco products; instead it creates an international legal framework for collective action on tobacco control. To examine the negotiation of this treaty, we use a simple analytical framework identifying (1) the specific problem requiring cross-border collective action, (2) the key actors, (3) their interests and 'stake' in this problem, (4) the potential forum or process for negotiations and (5) the potential scenarios for collective action. 10 We conducted this exercise based on secondary literature. We discuss lessons to be learned from the negotiations of the FCTC for potential applicability to diet-related chronic disease prevention, and, more specifically, the rise in obesity prevalence worldwide. The problem of increasing obesity shares some characteristics with both previous examples, infectious diseases and tobacco; there are also some important differences. Although national policies can often be effectively implemented without international collaboration, the globalisation of marketing strategies of the tobacco industry has rendered these insufficient. 'Advertising and smuggling do not stop at national borders' (Brundtland, 11 p. 751). Trade liberalisation, including reduction in trade barriers for tobacco products, has facilitated market access for tobacco companies and contributed to increasing tobacco use in many developing countries. 12 Two decades of bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements adopted by many nations engendered significantly greater competition in domestic tobacco marketsaccompanied by reduced prices for tobacco products and dramatic increases in the advertising and promotion of these products. 13, 14 Growing numbers of investment protection treaties have facilitated international industry in establishing its presence and expanding marketing of foreign products to capture local markets. Signatories of these treaties are expected to decrease restrictions on the entry and operation of foreign investments and protect them against adverse government regulations. 15 Multinational tobacco companies undermine the regulatory authority of national governments through public relations and lobbying strategies. 16 This problem is especially acute in developing countries, given the asymmetry of resources between large global tobacco companies and the governments of small countries. Problems addressed by global health diplomacy for tobacco control do not involve great interdependence among nations, creating 'a weaker foundation for diplomatic action' (Fidler, 10 p. 21). High levels of tobacco-related disease in one country do not directly affect the health of the citizens of another. Thus, global health diplomacy on issues of lesser interdependence is more arduous than in instances where countries directly feel the impact of the actions (or inaction) of their neighbours. WHO member states were able to come to an agreement on tobacco control, and therefore it is possible that other factors, including common challenges for regulating the industry, can provide sufficient impetus for success in global health diplomacy for chronic disease prevention. Many participants engaged in negotiating the FCTC, including the WHO itself as a 'policy entrepreneur' secretariat, while promoting collective actions at the global level. 16 The WHO also ensured the support and collaboration of the World Bank and other United Nations agencies. National governments remained central actors, with their ministries (trade, foreign policy, finance, taxation, customs and development working with health) adding multi-sectoral dimensions to the collaboration. The active role of developing countries in shaping the treaty stimulated progress toward the agreement. 17 Regional coalitions of countries, including one formed by the delegates from Africa, strengthened their negotiating positions. Highincome countries, including the United States, Japan and Germany, boldly advocated a minimalist FCTC. What has been the role of the tobacco industry in the negotiations of the FCTC? It was not united in opposition to stringent regulation. [T]he strategic responses to emergent regulation adopted by tobacco companies diverged significantly according to their respective market status. y [For instance] BAT was at the forefront of industry hostility to the WHO's approach, as might be predicted given that its comparative commercial strengths lie in developing regions where accelerated regulation would be expected to have the greatest impact. (Collin and Lee, 18 pp. 225-226) Pharmaceutical companies were also party to these negotiations. With the WHO they explored how nicotine replacement treatments could be made more widely available. 19 Non-governmental organisations took part, both as observers of the negotiating sessions and as advocates who pressured governments and others key actors to adopt strong tobacco control provisions. The Framework Convention Alliance, comprising nearly 300 organisations from over 100 countries, emerged as the key non-government actor to support the signing, ratification and implementation of the FCTC. The wide membership increased the likelihood that most of the delegations in Geneva would be pressured at home to adopt strong tobacco control provisions and to promote these actively throughout the negotiations. In contrast to other issues in global health diplomacy, in tobacco control commercial interests are very clear: measures to limit tobacco use would reduce the market and profits. Although markets had already stagnated and decreased in industrial countries, rapid growth of tobacco use in developing countries meant that a global treaty would threaten tobacco companies operating in these new and dynamic markets. Some firms demonstrated their opposition to the treaty by mounting a lobbying campaign against it and systematically searched for allies within governments. Other firms attempted to focus discussion on the few issues on which common ground could be found, for example how to limit underage use. Fidler distinguishes a transformative approach to global health diplomacy from an instrumental one. 10 The motivation for the first is the 'possibility of centering international relations on health as the normative engine of political cooperation and progress'; for the second, participants attempt 'to use health instrumentally to achieve other foreign policy and diplomatic goals' (Fidler, 10 p. 2). While the global health activists in NGOs adopted a transformative approach, the national governments adopt strategies where both approaches co-exist. Ministries of public health generally sought support for strong tobacco control measures, taking the transformative approach. But in their efforts to organise inter-sectoral collaboration among stronger domestic institutions including law enforcement or finance, health ministries often pursued international collaboration for instrumental reasons -to strengthen their positions nationally. Similarly, the WHO used the FCTC negotiations to attack tobacco-related health threats as well as to re-establish its status and credibility among UN agencies after years of decline under weak management without clear vision; tobacco control became part of the strategy to reposition the organisation as a 'department of consequence'. 20 A WHO initiative was to host the FCTC negotiations at its Geneva headquarters. Although the WHO possessed treaty-making powers since its inception, it had never exerted these, instead using its power to adopt international regulations and non-binding resolutions. The FCTC reflects influence from the framework-protocol approach often used in international environmental law, where the 'states agree to a framework treaty that contains only general obligations but establishes the diplomatic machinery that will push the legal regime to more specificity and effectiveness' (Fidler, 10 p. 40). Thus, the Framework convention on tobacco control sets obligations for signatories whose members commit to continuing negotiations within the context of specific protocols. Accordingly, in 2008 the WHO hosted the first session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body on a Protocol on Illicit Trade in Tobacco. Although negotiations of the FCTC remain in the tradition of the state-centric approach and forum to address global health challenges, they involve some newer multi-actor and multi-level interactions. In addition to their very active campaigning, some nongovernmental organisations came to be recognised participants in negotiations along with state delegations. To address the problems related to global marketing and advertising of tobacco products and the pressure from multinationals on national governments to curb regulatory actions, the WHO and its member governments, supported by a number of non-governmental actors, promoted the development of a multilateral treaty. This committed them to tobacco control measures on price and taxes, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, package and labelling requirements, product content, educational campaigns, restrictions on advertising, sponsorships and promotion, clinical intervention, subsidies and agricultural policies, and restrictions on youth access to tobacco and liability. These are domestic policies to be implemented at the national level. Why, then, were international negotiations needed to achieve such policy outcomes? The international commitments changed domestic political dynamics. The adoption and implementation of tobacco control measures strengthened the positions of public health advocates vis-à -vis pressure from multinational tobacco companies. Moreover, the treaty addressed the impact of globalisation of marketing and advertising of tobacco. Once all signatory governments agreed to restrict advertising and marketing of tobacco products, the treaty overcame the limitation of previously divergent national policies. The FCTC differs from previous treaties as it does not address problems between countries. 21 Rather, it tackles problems that all countries share. Some have suggested that treaty negotiations on national regulations to promote healthy diets would not be so different from the experience with tobacco control. 21 An important consideration is the extent of interdependence among nations as a key incentive for cross-border collaboration. What other incentives will lead national governments and other actors to pursue collective actions globally (or regionally)? Strengthening the position of national regulators and public health agencies to take on wellorganised lobbying became an incentive for cross-border collaboration. Liberal policies on tobacco marketing in one country or lax enforcement of anti-smuggling law could impact tobacco use in another country. Adoption of trade liberalisation and international trade agreements that have had a direct impact on tobacco availability and use, especially in developing countries, also involved interdependence. 22 The FCTC does not fully address this issue; although tension between trade liberalisation and tobacco control was evident in negotiations, the final text is silent on precedence of international trade law over the FCTC. 18 It will be useful to study this further given the importance of international trade agreements for healthy diets. 23 Although FCTC negotiations led to a multilateral treaty under the aegis of the WHO, those pursuing obesity reduction should not focus too narrowly on this specific forum. A key impact of FCTC negotiations lies outside the formal treaty: global networking among public health advocates inside and outside government and the diffusion of policies. Following intense international interactions on experiences with tobacco control policies, countries accelerated the adoption of new measures. As Collin and Lee observe, national policy development and FCTC negotiations clearly interacted. Once Canada adopted large graphic health warnings, Thailand, Brazil and the European Union replicated them. 18 Important impacts of the recent global health diplomacy on tobacco control include global mobilisation of civil society in support of the FCTC and the rise of a large coalition, the Framework Convention Alliance. What are the lessons we can draw from the experience of global diplomacy on tobacco control for obesity and diet-related chronic disease prevention? First, which actors need to be involved in the process? Political leadership, strong mobilisation and advocacy from well-organised groups globally are crucial in triggering and sustaining a global policy response such as an international treaty. Whether a critical mass of political capital is available at this point in the area of diet and nutrition remains to be seen. 24 Second, global health diplomacy on obesity will require a much stronger engagement with developing countries. Many of these countries perceive the discussions as more relevant to industrial countries despite the rapid growth of obesity in emerging and middle-income developing countries. With regard to diet and nutrition, the needs and concerns of developing countries will be more complex [than in tobacco control y]. The goal should be to promote the optimal diets for all. It also requires that greater attention be paid to the complex agricultural and economic issues related to subsidies and decisions about what is cultivated. 24 Such concerns would need to be well integrated in the agenda to assure inclusion of developing country interests in the negotiations. Third, we highlight the importance of a multi-sectoral approach, engaging a wide range of actors outside the health sector, including commercial ones. Some may provide leadership. A diverse group of businesses produce, process, distribute, market and sell food and drinks. For tobacco control, the ultimate public health goal is elimination of the industry. Obviously the food industry plays an essential role, and the policy 'end game' for chronic diseases is transformation to a health-oriented food system, not the extinction of the industry or many of its activities. As interests of some food industry actors (industries dealing in fresh fruits and vegetables) merge with those promoting global public policies for healthier diets, meaningful collaboration against obesity is likely to be easier to achieve. The fourth and final lesson relates to the forum for discussion and negotiation. The literature reveals different perspectives. Some representatives from the food industry object to the FCTC model, as an international treaty entails an adversarial approach that would be counterproductive: In many ways you could say the tobacco convention has laid out for the public health sector a road map which we should not follow for food. We should be doing almost the opposite. Instead of shaming and blaming we need to find ways of working with the industry. 25 Others suggest that the FCTC precedent, a binding international treaty, would provide a useful tool for regulating the food industry, especially for snack foods, sodas, fast foods and prepared foods that to blame for the great increase in obesity. 17 They remain sceptical about the possibility of productive collaboration with commercial actors given the ways in which interests diverge. 21 Another argument made in favour of the FCTC approach is the power of multilateral negotiations to mobilise groups to act nationally and locally and to increase the exchange of policy innovation. Emily Lee 26 suggested that motivation to adopt the framework-convention model involving an incremental approach to standard-setting, instead of one single detailed treaty for tobacco control, derived from anticipation of strong opposition from the tobacco industry. She also argued that the rationale applies in this case to obesity, and once again this incremental approach will be more likely to succeed. 26 Based on these lessons, we conclude that global health diplomacy for obesity prevention requires a much higher level of mobilisation of political leaders, civil society organisations, governments and non-state actors in developing countries, and engagement with the many private actors in the agri-food industries before healthy diet proponents are ready to negotiate a treaty similar to the FCTC. In order to progress as rapidly as possible, future analytical work should identify what issues could be more easily tackled in a collaborative manner, and for which issues regulation and a treaty would be the most effective instruments. Given that marketing of food to children is already on the global diplomatic agenda, researchers may want to focus on this. We draw a fifth and final lesson -beyond selection of an instrument or a forum for negotiations -on the importance of the process itself. Preparation for negotiations, mobilisation of civil society organisations, dialogue with industry, consultation with experts, and sharing of information among national health agencies are all necessary steps leading to negotiations. This process itself can foster the adoption of pro-health policies at the local, national, regional and global level. Ongoing discussions around a WHO code on the marketing of food to children are not yet taking place in the context of formal, multilateral negotiations, but they may already be influencing discourse and practices for tackling childhood obesity. Investing in these pre-negotiation exercises is an integral part of global health diplomacy for obesity prevention.",

Similarly, the WHO used the FCTC negotiations to attack tobacco-related health threats as well as to re-establish its status and credibility among UN agencies after years of decline under weak management without clear vision; tobacco control became part of the strategy to reposition the organisation as a 'department of consequence'. 20 A WHO initiative was to host the FCTC negotiations at its Geneva headquarters. Although the WHO possessed treaty-making powers since its inception, it had never exerted these, instead using its power to adopt international regulations and non-binding resolutions. The FCTC reflects influence from the framework-protocol approach often used in international environmental law, where the 'states agree to a framework treaty that contains only general obligations but establishes the diplomatic machinery that will push the legal regime to more specificity and effectiveness' (Fidler, 10 p. 40). Thus, the Framework convention on tobacco control sets obligations for signatories whose members commit to continuing negotiations within the context of specific protocols. Accordingly, in 2008 the WHO hosted the first session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body on a Protocol on Illicit Trade in Tobacco. Although negotiations of the FCTC remain in the tradition of the state-centric approach and forum to address global health challenges, they involve some newer multi-actor and multi-level interactions. In addition to their very active campaigning, some nongovernmental organisations came to be recognised participants in negotiations along with state delegations. To address the problems related to global marketing and advertising of tobacco products and the pressure from multinationals on national governments to curb regulatory actions, the WHO and its member governments, supported by a number of non-governmental actors, promoted the development of a multilateral treaty. This committed them to tobacco control measures on price and taxes, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, package and labelling requirements, product content, educational campaigns, restrictions on advertising, sponsorships and promotion, clinical intervention, subsidies and agricultural policies, and restrictions on youth access to tobacco and liability. These are domestic policies to be implemented at the national level. Why, then, were international negotiations needed to achieve such policy outcomes? The international commitments changed domestic political dynamics. The adoption and implementation of tobacco control measures strengthened the positions of public health advocates vis-à -vis pressure from multinational tobacco companies. Moreover, the treaty addressed the impact of globalisation of marketing and advertising of tobacco. Once all signatory governments agreed to restrict advertising and marketing of tobacco products, the treaty overcame the limitation of previously divergent national policies. The FCTC differs from previous treaties as it does not address problems between countries. 21 Rather, it tackles problems that all countries share. Some have suggested that treaty negotiations on national regulations to promote healthy diets would not be so different from the experience with tobacco control. 21 An important consideration is the extent of interdependence among nations as a key incentive for cross-border collaboration. What other incentives will lead national governments and other actors to pursue collective actions globally (or regionally)? Strengthening the position of national regulators and public health agencies to take on wellorganised lobbying became an incentive for cross-border collaboration. Liberal policies on tobacco marketing in one country or lax enforcement of anti-smuggling law could impact tobacco use in another country. Adoption of trade liberalisation and international trade agreements that have had a direct impact on tobacco availability and use, especially in developing countries, also involved interdependence. 22 The FCTC does not fully address this issue; although tension between trade liberalisation and tobacco control was evident in negotiations, the final text is silent on precedence of international trade law over the FCTC. 18 It will be useful to study this further given the importance of international trade agreements for healthy diets. 23 Although FCTC negotiations led to a multilateral treaty under the aegis of the WHO, those pursuing obesity reduction should not focus too narrowly on this specific forum. A key impact of FCTC negotiations lies outside the formal treaty: global networking among public health advocates inside and outside government and the diffusion of policies. Following intense international interactions on experiences with tobacco control policies, countries accelerated the adoption of new measures. As Collin and Lee observe, national policy development and FCTC negotiations clearly interacted. Once Canada adopted large graphic health warnings, Thailand, Brazil and the European Union replicated them. 18 Important impacts of the recent global health diplomacy on tobacco control include global mobilisation of civil society in support of the FCTC and the rise of a large coalition, the Framework Convention Alliance. What are the lessons we can draw from the experience of global diplomacy on tobacco control for obesity and diet-related chronic disease prevention? First, which actors need to be involved in the process? Political leadership, strong mobilisation and advocacy from well-organised groups globally are crucial in triggering and sustaining a global policy response such as an international treaty. Whether a critical mass of political capital is available at this point in the area of diet and nutrition remains to be seen. 24 Second, global health diplomacy on obesity will require a much stronger engagement with developing countries. Many of these countries perceive the discussions as more relevant to industrial countries despite the rapid growth of obesity in emerging and middle-income developing countries. With regard to diet and nutrition, the needs and concerns of developing countries will be more complex [than in tobacco control y]. The goal should be to promote the optimal diets for all. It also requires that greater attention be paid to the complex agricultural and economic issues related to subsidies and decisions about what is cultivated. 24 Such concerns would need to be well integrated in the agenda to assure inclusion of developing country interests in the negotiations. Third, we highlight the importance of a multi-sectoral approach, engaging a wide range of actors outside the health sector, including commercial ones. Some may provide leadership. A diverse group of businesses produce, process, distribute, market and sell food and drinks. For tobacco control, the ultimate public health goal is elimination of the industry. Obviously the food industry plays an essential role, and the policy 'end game' for chronic diseases is transformation to a health-oriented food system, not the extinction of the industry or many of its activities. As interests of some food industry actors (industries dealing in fresh fruits and vegetables) merge with those promoting global public policies for healthier diets, meaningful collaboration against obesity is likely to be easier to achieve. The fourth and final lesson relates to the forum for discussion and negotiation. The literature reveals different perspectives. Some representatives from the food industry object to the FCTC model, as an international treaty entails an adversarial approach that would be counterproductive: In many ways you could say the tobacco convention has laid out for the public health sector a road map which we should not follow for food. We should be doing almost the opposite. Instead of shaming and blaming we need to find ways of working with the industry. 25 Others suggest that the FCTC precedent, a binding international treaty, would provide a useful tool for regulating the food industry, especially for snack foods, sodas, fast foods and prepared foods that to blame for the great increase in obesity. 17 They remain sceptical about the possibility of productive collaboration with commercial actors given the ways in which interests diverge. 21 Another argument made in favour of the FCTC approach is the power of multilateral negotiations to mobilise groups to act nationally and locally and to increase the exchange of policy innovation. Emily Lee 26 suggested that motivation to adopt the framework-convention model involving an incremental approach to standard-setting, instead of one single detailed treaty for tobacco control, derived from anticipation of strong opposition from the tobacco industry. She also argued that the rationale applies in this case to obesity, and once again this incremental approach will be more likely to succeed. 26 Based on these lessons, we conclude that global health diplomacy for obesity prevention requires a much higher level of mobilisation of political leaders, civil society organisations, governments and non-state actors in developing countries, and engagement with the many private actors in the agri-food industries before healthy diet proponents are ready to negotiate a treaty similar to the FCTC. In order to progress as rapidly as possible, future analytical work should identify what issues could be more easily tackled in a collaborative manner, and for which issues regulation and a treaty would be the most effective instruments. Given that marketing of food to children is already on the global diplomatic agenda, researchers may want to focus on this. We draw a fifth and final lesson -beyond selection of an instrument or a forum for negotiations -on the importance of the process itself. Preparation for negotiations, mobilisation of civil society organisations, dialogue with industry, consultation with experts, and sharing of information among national health agencies are all necessary steps leading to negotiations. This process itself can foster the adoption of pro-health policies at the local, national, regional and global level. Ongoing discussions around a WHO code on the marketing of food to children are not yet taking place in the context of formal, multilateral negotiations, but they may already be influencing discourse and practices for tackling childhood obesity. Investing in these pre-negotiation exercises is an integral part of global health diplomacy for obesity prevention.",

         "Mortality and morbidity in fire victims are largely a function of injury due to heat and smoke. While the degree and area of burn together constitute a reliable numerical measure of cutaneous injury due to heat, as yet no satisfactory measure of inhalation injury has been developed. In this study, we employed technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) radioaerosol lung scintigraphy (inhalation scan) to evaluate acute inhalation injury in fire victims. Ten normal controls and 17 survivors from a fire accident were enrolled in the study. All patients suffered from respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea and/or cough with sputum).(99m)Tc-DTPA aerosol inhalation lung scintigraphy was performed in all subjects, using a commercial lung aerosol delivery unit. The degree of lung damage was presented as the clearance rate (k; %/min) calculated from the time-activity curve over the right lungs. In addition, the distribution pattern of the radioactivity in the lungs was evaluated and classified into two groups: homogeneous distribution and inhomogeneous distribution. A plain chest radiograph (CxR) and pulmonary function test (PFT) were performed in the same group of patients. The results showed that 6/17 (35.3%) opatients had inhomogeneous distribution of radioactivity in their inhalation scans, and 11/17 (64,7%) had homogeneous scans. Five of the six patients with inhomogeneous scans were admitted for further management, and all patients with homogeneous scans were discharged from the emergency department and needed no further intensive care. The clearance rates of the right lung were 0.73%±0.13%/min from normal controls and 1.54%±0.58%/min for fire victims. The difference was significant, with aP value of less than 0.01. Using a cut-off value of 0.9%/min (all normal subjects were below 0.9%/min) 14 (82.4%) patients had abnormal clearance rates of(99m)Tc-DTPA from the lung. In contrast, only three (17.6%) patients had abnormal CxR and three (17.6%) had abnormal PFTs. We conclude that (1) conventional CxR and PFT are not good modalities for evaluating inhalation injury in fire victims because of their low sensitivity, and (2)(99m)Tc-DTPA radioaerosol inhalation scintigraphy can provide an objective evaluation of inhalation injury during a fire accident and may be useful in therapeutic decision-making and disease monitoring.",

         "Smoke inhalation has a major influence on the pulmonary complications that may occur after fires [1] . When smoke is inhaled, the lungs are injured directly by the heat from the flames and, more importantly, by the products of incomplete combustion [2, 3] . Significant inhalation injury probably adds 30%-40% to the mortality of extensive burns, with a high incidence of late-onset pneumonia [4, 5] . However, there is still a lack of a simple, sensitive and effective diagnostic modality for evaluating the lung condition in these patients. Early reports suggested that plain chest radiograph was of little value in the diagnosis and management of patients after acute smoke inhalation [6, 7] . Recently, the non-invasive measurement of the clearance rate of technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) aerosol has been used to investigate pulmonary epithelial permeability under different physiological conditions [8] [9] [10] [11] , in those who smoke [12, 13] and in various pulmonary disorders [14] [15] [16] . 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol inhalation lung scintigraphy (inhalation scan) has proven to be a highly sensitive and useful modality for detecting early lung damage. In this study, we evaluated the value of the inhalation scan for monitoring pulmonary damage in fire victims, and compared the results with those of chest X-ray films (CxR) and pulmonary function tests (PFT). European Journal of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 24, No. 2, February 1997 -9 Springer-Verlag 1997 Materials. Thirty-seven patients were sent to the emergency room following a closed-space explosive accident in a local power plant. Patients with a history of smoking or previous lung disease were excluded. Finally, 17 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the subjects was 47.6 years (range 24-71 years). In addition, ten normal subjects were included as normal controls. CxR, PFT and inhalation scans were performed on all patients within 48 h after the accident, except in three patients who received the inhalation scan several days later (two on the 4th day and the other on the 12th day) because they were intubated in a critical condition. Values of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV~/FVC were calculated to evaluate pulmonary function. A value below 80% of the predicted value was considered abnormal. 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol inhalation lung scintigraphy. The 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol clearance speed, presented as a clearance rate (k; %/rain) from lungs to blood, was measured in all individuals. The radioaerosols were generated from a commercial lung aerosol delivery unit (Aero/Vent, Medi Nuclear, USA) containing 7400 MBq (20 mCi) 99mTc-DTPA in 2-4 ml saline. The radioaerosol droplet size was measured by an inertial impactor (Model PC-2, California Measurement Inc, Calif., USA). The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol was smaller than 1 gm under a 6-7 1/min air flow rate. All subjects were positioned supine and told to inhale for 2-3 min from the aerosol delivery unit until the total radioactivity was over 200000 counts. Data were collected for another 30 rain by means of a large-field computerized gamma camera (Apex 609R, Elscint Ltd., Haifa, Israel), over the posterior view, which included the entire chest. Data were acquired as a series of 30 consecutive frames, one minute per frame, in a 64x64 matrix with word mode. Upon completion of the data acquisition, the first image in the series was displayed and further regions of interest were automatically created over both lungs. Radioactivity was corrected for radionuclide decay and background subtraction. Time-activity curves were generated over both lungs. A power exponential fitting routine was then used to calculate the clearance rate (k; %/min). However, only the right lung was used to analyse clearance, in order to avoid interference from stomach activity on the left side. In addition, based on the first 1-min frame, distribution patterns of the radioactivity in the lungs were classified into two groups (homogeneous distribution and inhomogeneous distribution) by two observers. Detailed data are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Eight survivors had skin burns, all limited to their faces and hands. Of the 17 fire victims, 12 were discharged from the emergency department and five were hospitalized (in four cases due to respiratory problems and in one case due to skin burn) for periods ranging from 7 to 50 days. Three required endotracheal intubation and one required ventilation for 17 days as a result of adult respiratory distress syndrome. The clearance rates of the right lung were 0.73%_+0.13%/rain for normal controls and 1.54%_+0.58%/min for fire victims (Fig. 1) . The difference was significant, with P values of less than 0.01. Using a cut-off value of 0.9%/min (all normal subjects were below 0.9%/rain), 14/17 (82.4%) patients had an abnormal clearance rate of 99mTc-DTPA from the lung, while only three (17.6%) patients had abnormal PFT and three (17.6%) had abnormal CxR findings. Comparisons between these diagnostic modalities are tabulated in Table 3, according to hospitalization or non-hospitalization of the patients. In Table 4 , the results of different diagnostic modalities and clinical findings are shown according to the distribution pattern of radioactivity in the inhalation scintiscan. Six of the 17 (35.3%) patients showed inhomogeneous distribution of radioactivity in their inhalation scans (Fig. 2 ) while 11/17 (64.7%) had homogeneous scans (Fig. 3) . Five of the six patients with inhomogeneous scans were admitted for further management, and all patients with homogeneous scans were discharged from the emergency department and needed no further intensive care. Both PFT and chest X-ray showed less sensitivity in detecting lung injury than the inhalation scan. Significant damage may be caused both to the airways and to the lung parenchyma following acute smoke and heat inhalation. In the upper and major airways, heat injury and acute smoke inhalation cause oedema, necrosis and sloughing of the mucosa, bronchospasm, and cessation of ciliary movement of the bronchial epithilium. These conditions often lead to airway obstruction and atelectasis [17, 18] . In the lung parenchyma, smoke causes parenchymal injury to the alveolar epithilium. This results in pulmonary capillary permeability, pulmonary oedema and interference with gas exchange [19, 20] . This often leads to acute pulmonary insufficiency, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in burn victims [20] . The most striking abnormality in the lungs after smoke inhalation is airway obstruction, because of particulate debris and irritant volatile vapours from synthetic polymers from materials used in construction, furni-ture and decoration [21] . In addition, heat injury also causes mucosal oedema of the major airways and can result in airway obstruction. In the inhalation scan, obstruction of small airways will block the entry of 99mTc-DTPA into the lung parenchyma and present an area with hyporadioactivity or without radioactivity in the lung (inhomogeneous distribution). Therefore, evaluating the distribution pattern of radioactivity after inhalation of the radioaerosol should be a useful and direct way to monitor the existence and severity of small airway obstruction. In our study, the five victims who had to be hospitalized showed inhomogeneous distribution of radioactivity in the lung, while almost all the patients who needed no hospitalization showed a homogeneous distribution pattern. The results suggest that the inhomogeneous distribution of radioactivity in an initial inhalation scan may indicate a more serious inhalation injury, and further treatment may be necessary for these patients. Interestingly, the clearance rates of 99mTc-DTPA from the lungs in patients who had to be admitted for further treatment were not higher than those in patients who needed no further treatment. Actually, they were slightly lower. The hospitalized patients should have had obstructions of small airways, since all of them had an inhomogeneous distribution scan. Our explanation is that in cases with airway obstruction, the airflow is decreased and a relatively large amount of radiotracer could deposit in the airway instead of the alveoli. The clearance rate of the radiotracer in the small airways is surely slower than in the alveoli. Therefore, in cases with inhomogeneous distribution of radioactivity, the clearance rate is not a reliable criterion for the detection of pulmonary injury in fire victims. In our study, of the six patients with inhomogeneous distribution, two (33%) (nos. 7 and 13) who needed admission for further treatment had normal clearance rates. By contrast, of the 11 patients with homogeneous distribution, only one (9%) had a clearance rate lower than 0.9. We suggest that interpretation of inhalation scintigraphy in fire victims should focus on the distribution pattern of radioactivity first, and then use the clearance rate to evaluate the integrity of the alveoli. The value of the CxR in evaluation of the respiratory system in fire victims is debatable. Stone et al. [6] and Eaton et al. [7] suggested that the value of CxR in the diagnosis and management of patients after acute smoke inhalation is limited [6, 7] , whereas Teixidor et al. [22] and Lee and O'Connell [23] stressed the importance of the CxR in the early post-exposure period. In our study, only three patients had positive radiographic findings, but all three needed endotracheal intubation. We conclude that the CxR is not a sensitive modality in evaluating lung damage after smoke inhalation. Abnormality on chest films may not be seen until a severe complication such as atelectasis, alveolar oedema or bronchopneumonia develops. However, the initial CxR is still an important predictor (especially in significant smoke inhalation injuries) and enables selection of patients likely to need endotracheal intubation. Assessment of the effects of smoke inhalation on respiratory function is difficult because pre-exposure lung function is unlikely to be known unless the subject has had a pre-existing lung disease and has come to the hospital for help. Therefore, we could only compare the PFT of patients with a normal database, and considered it to be abnormal when the values were below 80% of normal predicted values. However, these criteria seemed only able to detect serious cases of pulmonary injury in fire victims. In our study, only the three patients with long hospitalization had abnormal PFT. In addition, measurements of PFT requiring cooperation from severely ill persons could yield spurious results. Our data suggest that PFT may be not a sensitive test in detecting pulmonary injury in fire victims. Although the number of patients in our study was small, there was a strildng incidence of airway obstruction after smoke inhalation. The findings of abnormal inhalation scintigraphy in most of the fire victims suggest that smoke inhalation may lead to more damage to the respiratory system than has previously been recognized. We conclude that the conventional chest X-ray and pulmonary function test are not good modalities for evaluating inhalation injury in fire victims because of their low sensitivity. In contrast, 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol inhalation scintigraphy can provide an objective evaluation of inhalation injury during a fire accident and, therefore, may be useful in therapeutic decision-making and disease monitoring.",

[7] suggested that the value of CxR in the diagnosis and management of patients after acute smoke inhalation is limited [6, 7] , whereas Teixidor et al. [22] and Lee and O'Connell [23] stressed the importance of the CxR in the early post-exposure period. In our study, only three patients had positive radiographic findings, but all three needed endotracheal intubation. We conclude that the CxR is not a sensitive modality in evaluating lung damage after smoke inhalation. Abnormality on chest films may not be seen until a severe complication such as atelectasis, alveolar oedema or bronchopneumonia develops. However, the initial CxR is still an important predictor (especially in significant smoke inhalation injuries) and enables selection of patients likely to need endotracheal intubation. Assessment of the effects of smoke inhalation on respiratory function is difficult because pre-exposure lung function is unlikely to be known unless the subject has had a pre-existing lung disease and has come to the hospital for help. Therefore, we could only compare the PFT of patients with a normal database, and considered it to be abnormal when the values were below 80% of normal predicted values. However, these criteria seemed only able to detect serious cases of pulmonary injury in fire victims. In our study, only the three patients with long hospitalization had abnormal PFT. In addition, measurements of PFT requiring cooperation from severely ill persons could yield spurious results. Our data suggest that PFT may be not a sensitive test in detecting pulmonary injury in fire victims. Although the number of patients in our study was small, there was a strildng incidence of airway obstruction after smoke inhalation. The findings of abnormal inhalation scintigraphy in most of the fire victims suggest that smoke inhalation may lead to more damage to the respiratory system than has previously been recognized. We conclude that the conventional chest X-ray and pulmonary function test are not good modalities for evaluating inhalation injury in fire victims because of their low sensitivity. In contrast, 99mTc-DTPA radioaerosol inhalation scintigraphy can provide an objective evaluation of inhalation injury during a fire accident and, therefore, may be useful in therapeutic decision-making and disease monitoring.",

         "Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients?: Results after routine polymerase chain reaction point-of-care testing in the emergency room from 2017/2018",
         "PURPOSE: The clinical presentation, complications and mortality in molecularly confirmed influenza A and B infections were analyzed. METHODS: This retrospective observational single-centre study included all influenza positive patients older than 18 years who were hospitalized and treated at the flu isolation ward during 2017/2018. The diagnosis was based on point-of-care tests with the Alere(TM). RESULTS: Of the 396 patients tested positive for influenza, 24.2% had influenza A and 75.8% influenza B. Influenza A patients were younger (median age 67.5 years vs. 77 years, p < 0.001), were more often smokers (27.7% vs. 16.8%, p = 0.021), had chronic pulmonary diseases more frequently (39.6% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.013), presented with a higher body temperature (38.6 °C vs. 38.3 °C, p = 0.004), leucocyte count (8 G/L vs. 6.8 G/L, p = 0.002), C‑reactive protein (CRP) level (41 mg/l vs. 23 mg/l, p < 0.001) and had dyspnea more often (41.7% vs. 28%, p = 0.012). Influenza B patients had an underlying chronic kidney disease in 37% vs. 18.8% (p < 0.001) and presented with vomiting on admission more frequently (21.7% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.027). Influenza A patients were admitted for 8 days vs. 7 days (p = 0.023). There were no differences in the rate of complications; however, 22 (5.6%) patients died during the hospital stay. The in-hospital mortality was higher in influenza A patients (8.3% vs 4.7%, p = 0.172). CONCLUSION: Some differences were found between influenza A and B virus infections but symptoms were overlapping, which necessitates polymerase chain reaction point-of-care testing for accurate diagnosis. Influenza A was a more severe disease than influenza B during the period 2017/2018.",

         "Influenza infections occur in seasonal outbreaks during the winter period related to cold or humid weather conditions and are associated with an excess hospitalization and an increase in overall mortality [1, 9] . Due to a lack of accurate diagnostic tools in the past the cause of death might often have been inaccurate and the influenza-associated mortality underestimated [1, 2, 8] . While studies show pneumonia and influenza excess mortality during influenza seasons, the all-cause mortality in the same period is also 3.8 times higher [1] . High virulence and insufficient vaccination response result in up to 10 9 cases of influenza virus infections yearly [3] [4] [5] . Until recently laboratory tests for influenza diagnosis have been reserved for monitoring epidemics and clinical trials. This lack of confirmation renders the diagnosis relying on clinical parameters often inaccurate since the manifestations of influenza may vary greatly depending on patient characteristics, especially age and comorbidities [2, 6] . Particularly in 362 Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients? K original article high-risk hospitalized patients the diagnosis may be missed due to exacerbation of symptoms of pre-existing diseases or atypical presentation bearing the risk of inadequate treatment [7] [8] [9] . The increased availability of point-of-care testing (POCT) assists with the diagnosis of influenza virus infections during epidemic seasons. While rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) based on immunoassays have limited use due to low sensitivity [10, 11] polymerase chain reaction (PCR) POCT devices allow a simple, rapid, cost-effective and accurate means of diagnosis [12] [13] [14] [15] . This ensures correct management of influenza virus infections including prompt initiation of antiviral treatment, preventing onward transmission and avoiding overuse of antibiotics [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . With POCT being widely available, recent studies showed similar influenza virus positive samples for patients presenting with various typical as well as atypical clinical manifestations at emergency departments [8, 9] . Since real world information of molecularly confirmed influenza infections in hospitalized patients is missing a retrospective analysis of patient history, symptoms on admission, complications and mortality was conducted to identify any differences in hospitalized influenza A and B patients after implementing routine PCR testing prior to admission to influenza wards. This retrospective observational single center study was carried out at the flu isolation ward of the infectious diseases department of the Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Hospital in Vienna, Austria. The department consists of 2 wards with 28 beds each and an intensive care unit with 10 beds. The hospital has an isolation policy for influenza positive patients. Patients presenting at the emergency department with influenza-like illness undergo POCT for influenza virus infections with the Alere TM i Influenza A & B assay (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) performed by trained professionals. The Alere TM i Influenza A & B assay uses rapid nucleic acid amplification and was chosen as it produces reliable results within 15 min [12] [13] [14] [15] . The time until the test result is available is an essential factor in this organizational setting. Influenza virus positive patients who needed in-patient treatment were transferred directly to the isolation ward. Whether a patient had to be admitted to this ward or could be treated on an outpatient basis had to be decided by the physician at the emergency department. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Approval number EK 18-106-VK) and due to the retrospective nature of this study informed consent was not necessary. Data were collected from patient medical files. The information was double entered into a MS Excel sheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA), anonymized and verified for accuracy. The patient medical files included demographic information, laboratory results, symptoms, information about treatment and underlying medical conditions. All patients older than 18 years who tested positive for influenza virus infections with the Alere TM i Influenza A & B assay and needed in-patient care at the isolation ward within the influenza season 2017/2018 (October 2017-April 2018) were included in this retrospective evaluation. Patients who required immunosuppression due to organ transplantation or had undergone stem cell transplantation were not included. The 30-day and 90-day follow-up evaluations were carried out by telephone calls. Baseline characteristics were tabulated with proportions for categorical variables or median (Md) and interquartile range (IQR) for not normally distributed metric variables. Cross-tables, χ 2 -test and Fisher's exact test (where applicable) were carried out to identify differences between influenza type and dichotomous categorical variables. For non-normally distributed variables Mann-Whitney U-tests were calculated to test for differences in metric variables. The study is exploratory and retrospective, therefore the alpha-level was not corrected for multiple tests. A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. After importing the MS Excel sheet all analyses were made with SPSS 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) for Mac OS (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA). Fever was defined as a body temperature ≥38°C, measured by via ear thermometers. Respiratory insufficiency was defined as the need for oxygen by any kind of device (e.g. nasal cannula, masks). The need for oxygen was assessed by the treating physician. Pneumonia was defined as a consolidation and/or opacity on a radiological image (mostly X-ray) accompanied by elevated inflammation markers and/or fever. Rhabdomyolysis was defined as a creatinine kinase (CK) level above 1000 U/l. Heart failure was defined by new onset or worsening of peripheral edema and/or congestion on X-ray in patients with history of chronic heart failure and without any other cause. Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase of creatinine level by 0.3 mg/dl from the baseline kidney function within 48 h or an increase of ≥1.5 times the baseline presumed to have occurred with the previous 7 days due to the current episode of illness. In cases of a missing creatinine baseline the acute kidney injury was retrospectively assessed by comparing the creatinine level on admission and on the day of discharge, which was assumed to be the baseline function. Symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, ab- The updated version of the Charlson comorbidity score [31] was used. The score ranges from 0 to 24 sence of fever or acute heart failure were considered as atypical because they are primarily not indicative of influenza virus infections. The study population consisted of 396 people. The distribution between influenza A and influenza B positive patients was unequal with influenza B being the more common infection. Gender distribution was equal in both groups. The vaccination status was not known for all patients. There were no differences in vaccination rates between the two influenza groups. Patients who tested positive for influenza A were significantly younger than influenza B positive patients. Significantly more patients in the influenza A group had a history of a chronic pulmonary disease and were current smokers. Patients with influenza B suffered significantly more often from chronic kidney disease. No differences were found in the proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, history of congestive heart failure, diabetes, stroke, dementia and tumors and no differences in the Charlson comorbidity score were found. For details see Table 1 . The symptoms with which the patients presented at this hospital are listed in Table 2 and sorted from the most common to the least common. Fever, cough and malaise were the three most common symptoms with no differences between the two influenza types. Patients with influenza A had a higher body temperature and a higher number of patients suffered from high grade fever defined as a body temperature ≥39°C (41.5% vs. 27.6%, p = 0.037). More patients with influenza A suffered from dyspnea, whereas vomiting was reported more frequently in influenza B patients. No differences were found in the symptoms on admission between influenza A and B in the proportion of cough, malaise, abrupt onset of symptoms, muscle ache, diarrhea, cognitive impairment, thoracic pain, 364 Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients? K original article  Laboratory parameters were analyzed on admission for every patient (Table 3) . Patients with influenza A had a significantly higher leucocyte count and a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level on admission. In contrast patients with influenza B presented with a higher creatinine level and therefore a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) No differences were found in the level of creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), bilirubin and oxygen saturation (O2). Patients with influenza A had a significantly longer length of hospital stay. No differences were found for the following complications: pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, acute heart failure and myocardial infarction. For details see Table 4 . In total 22 out of 396 patients (5.6%) died during the stay at hospital. There was no effect of the influenza type on the in-hospital mortality or the impact of the influenza type on the 30-day and the 90-day mortality. The 90-day mortality increased further to 9.4%. For details see Table 5 . In The decision to prescribe oseltamivir was made by the treating physician based on the time of symptom onset and the disease severity. In the season examined it was not common at this ward to treat every hospitalized patient with oseltamivir. There was no relationship between treatment with oseltamivir and the rate of complications or in-hospital mortality. Patients who were treated with oseltamivir had a longer in-hospital stay (7 days, IQR 6-9 vs. 6 days, IQR 4.5-9, p = 0.011). Antibiotics were given to 44.8% of influenza A patients and 36% of influenza B patients (p = 0.123). This study showed various differences in the clinical presentation and complication rates in hospitalized patients with influenza A and B. Patients with influenza A tended to be younger and were more likely to have dyspnea and higher fever. Patients with K Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients? 365 original article Table 3 Laboratory parameters of the patients on admission influenza B had atypical presentations more often including vomiting and a partial absence of respiratory symptoms, which are classically associated with influenza. Mortality rates tended to be numerically higher in influenza A versus B. In previous studies comparing demographic attributes of patients with influenza A and B, a higher age for patients with influenza A was described although this may vary according to influenza A strains. Patients with H3N2 were shown to be older than influenza B patients while patients with H1N1 tended to be younger than patients with influenza B [21] [22] [23] . A French study by Chagvardieff et al. analyzed patients presenting at an emergency department and similarly to the present results influenza B patients were significantly older [24] . The age difference therefore seems to depend on the study population as well as the dominant influenza A subtype. Unfortunately, no information was available about influenza subtypes in the current population; however, during the season concerned influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B/Yamagata were the dominant subtypes in Austria [25] . It has been shown that patients with influenza A suffered more often from chronic diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [22, 27] . Furthermore, patients with influenza A were more likely to be smokers. In patients suffering from influenza B infections chronic kidney disease was more frequent. A non-statistically significant trend towards a higher proportion of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease in the history of patients with influenza B was observed in this study population, which could be explained by the higher mean age of this group. In this population influenza A patients presented with a higher body temperature and with dyspnea statistically more often. Influenza B infections were associated with vomiting. A Japanese study with adults who consulted a medical center with influenza infections combined gastrointestinal symptom (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, epigastric pain) with one parameter and showed that they are more common in influenza B. Matching the present findings they also showed a higher body temperature in influenza A infected patients [26] . Other studies with a younger population and outpatient treatment did not show any differences in clinical presentation [21, 23] . A study of 2791 hospitalized patients reported a higher rate of ICU admission, ARDS, mechanical ventilation and pneumonia in influenza pdmH1N1 patients compared to H3N2 and influenza B patients although this study included children as well and represented a much younger study population [27] . In this study the rate of ICU admission and respiratory failure was higher in influenza A but this did not reach statistical significance. Pneumonia was the most common complication (24%) and equal in both groups. There was a trend towards a higher proportion of acute kidney injury in the influenza B group, which probably could be attributed to the higher age, higher amount of chronic kidney disease and vomiting as a common symptom in this population. Despite the fact that the influenza A patients were younger, they had a longer median in-hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days). This might reflect the fact that patients with influenza A were sicker and had a prolonged recovery. The overall in-hospital mortality rate for both groups was 5.6% with a numerically but not statistically significantly higher mortality rate in the influenza A group (8.3% for influenza A vs. 4.7% for influenza B, p = 0.172). Other studies of hospitalized patients described a similar mortality rate (3.7-5.2%) without differences between influenza A and B virus infections [27, 28, 32] . Of the studies one analyzed community and healthcare-acquired influenza infections and described an in-hospital mortality rate of 366 Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients? K original article 10%. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but may be due to the dominance of H3N2, which caused approximately 60% of the influenza infections in this study [33] . In the present population influenza B accounted for 75% of the infections and most of the influenza A infections were most likely caused by H1N1 [25] . In this study the 90-day mortality increased further to 9.4% with no difference between influenza A and influenza B, which represented a twofold increase in mortality. This was not surprising as there is an increased risk for complications leading to death after influenza infections as previously described [29] . The strength of this study is that it focused on hospitalized patients, so any immediate complications could be tracked, especially pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death which are of great interest and a potential healthcare burden. In addition, efforts were made to assess mortality in the months after influenza infection. There are several limitations of this study. Almost 75% were infected with influenza B therefore the results may not be generalized to influenza A dominant seasons. The study did not differentiate between H1N1 and H3N2 and analyzed the two strains as one group. The symptoms on admission were not collected via a standardized questionnaire which may explain why mild common influenza-like symptoms, such as sore throat and coryza were underreported, especially in patients presenting with severe symptoms, such as dyspnea to the emergency department. There was no standardized testing for specific laboratory results which is why some parameters were missing. While the three most common symptoms (fever, malaise/prostration, cough) were according to typical manifestations described in textbooks [30] the frequently described abrupt onset was not nearly as common in the setting of hospitalized patients with influenza. It is remarkable that gastrointestinal complaints, acute kidney injury and acute heart failure were the leading symptoms. In conclusion, this study identified various differences in the presentation and medical history between patients infected with influenza A and B; however, symptoms were overlapping and definite differentiation on mere clinical parameters was not reliable. The use of PCR-POCT for accurate diagnosis seems to be necessary.",

Unfortunately, no information was available about influenza subtypes in the current population; however, during the season concerned influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B/Yamagata were the dominant subtypes in Austria [25] . It has been shown that patients with influenza A suffered more often from chronic diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [22, 27] . Furthermore, patients with influenza A were more likely to be smokers. In patients suffering from influenza B infections chronic kidney disease was more frequent. A non-statistically significant trend towards a higher proportion of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease in the history of patients with influenza B was observed in this study population, which could be explained by the higher mean age of this group. In this population influenza A patients presented with a higher body temperature and with dyspnea statistically more often. Influenza B infections were associated with vomiting. A Japanese study with adults who consulted a medical center with influenza infections combined gastrointestinal symptom (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, epigastric pain) with one parameter and showed that they are more common in influenza B. Matching the present findings they also showed a higher body temperature in influenza A infected patients [26] . Other studies with a younger population and outpatient treatment did not show any differences in clinical presentation [21, 23] . A study of 2791 hospitalized patients reported a higher rate of ICU admission, ARDS, mechanical ventilation and pneumonia in influenza pdmH1N1 patients compared to H3N2 and influenza B patients although this study included children as well and represented a much younger study population [27] . In this study the rate of ICU admission and respiratory failure was higher in influenza A but this did not reach statistical significance. Pneumonia was the most common complication (24%) and equal in both groups. There was a trend towards a higher proportion of acute kidney injury in the influenza B group, which probably could be attributed to the higher age, higher amount of chronic kidney disease and vomiting as a common symptom in this population. Despite the fact that the influenza A patients were younger, they had a longer median in-hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days). This might reflect the fact that patients with influenza A were sicker and had a prolonged recovery. The overall in-hospital mortality rate for both groups was 5.6% with a numerically but not statistically significantly higher mortality rate in the influenza A group (8.3% for influenza A vs. 4.7% for influenza B, p = 0.172). Other studies of hospitalized patients described a similar mortality rate (3.7-5.2%) without differences between influenza A and B virus infections [27, 28, 32] . Of the studies one analyzed community and healthcare-acquired influenza infections and described an in-hospital mortality rate of 366 Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients? K original article 10%. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but may be due to the dominance of H3N2, which caused approximately 60% of the influenza infections in this study [33] . In the present population influenza B accounted for 75% of the infections and most of the influenza A infections were most likely caused by H1N1 [25] . In this study the 90-day mortality increased further to 9.4% with no difference between influenza A and influenza B, which represented a twofold increase in mortality. This was not surprising as there is an increased risk for complications leading to death after influenza infections as previously described [29] . The strength of this study is that it focused on hospitalized patients, so any immediate complications could be tracked, especially pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death which are of great interest and a potential healthcare burden. In addition, efforts were made to assess mortality in the months after influenza infection. There are several limitations of this study. Almost 75% were infected with influenza B therefore the results may not be generalized to influenza A dominant seasons. The study did not differentiate between H1N1 and H3N2 and analyzed the two strains as one group. The symptoms on admission were not collected via a standardized questionnaire which may explain why mild common influenza-like symptoms, such as sore throat and coryza were underreported, especially in patients presenting with severe symptoms, such as dyspnea to the emergency department. There was no standardized testing for specific laboratory results which is why some parameters were missing. While the three most common symptoms (fever, malaise/prostration, cough) were according to typical manifestations described in textbooks [30] the frequently described abrupt onset was not nearly as common in the setting of hospitalized patients with influenza. It is remarkable that gastrointestinal complaints, acute kidney injury and acute heart failure were the leading symptoms. In conclusion, this study identified various differences in the presentation and medical history between patients infected with influenza A and B; however, symptoms were overlapping and definite differentiation on mere clinical parameters was not reliable. The use of PCR-POCT for accurate diagnosis seems to be necessary.",

Regional alterations in permeability can also be noted using this radionuclide technique. We have measured the pulmonary epithelial permeability in normal subjects and the alteration in smokers, in glue-sniffers, in patients with inhalation burns, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in patients with lung metastases from thyroid cancer treated with radioiodine(131)I. In the normal volunteers, the time taken for 50% of inhaled(99m)Tc DTPA to be cleared from the lungs (T1/2) was 66 minutes ± lsd of 12 mins. The smokers had a mean T1/2 of 20 mins ± lsd 4 min. In the hard-core glue-sniffing group, the majority were smokers who had stopped smoking and gluesniffing for periods varying from 1 day to 42 days, and it was possible to note the changes in clearance times against period of abstinence. In the patients with inhalation burns, there was change in lung clearance arising from pulmonary epithelial damage; these patients showed increased rate of clearance (short T1/2) with mean T1/2 of 36 min ± 1 sd of 11 mins, while the retention images revealed regional lung damage in moderately severe inhalation burns. Twenty-four patients with COPD had inhalation scans done with Tc-99m tin colloid radioaerosol, and these images were compared with the perfusion lung scans done with(99m)Tc macroaggregated albumin (MAA); in general the perfusion images matched the defects noted in the inhalation scans. The(99m)Tc DTPA clearance rate in these patients was normal i.e. T1/2 = 78 ± 14 mins.

Acute lung injury is defined as \"a syndrome of inflammation and increasing permeability that is associated with a constellation of clinical, radiologic, and physiologic abnormalities that cannot be explained by, but may coexist with, left atrial or pulmonary capillary hypertension.\"z It has been proposed that definition of acute lung injury should relate structural to pathophysiological changes.=' Alteration in capillary membrane integrity (permeability) cannot be quantified by a single parameter and this is relevant when pulmonary vascular permeability is evaluated in the clinical situation. Nuclear medicine methods can be used to observe changes in integrity of pulmonary capillary endothelium (with first pass dual-indicator dilution technique using successive injections of radiotracer° or by measuring accumulation of radioactively labelled protein into the lung),' and of alveolar epithelium, and it is important that the damage should be detected before patients develop clinical pulmonary oedema, so that intensive therapy can be instituted early. We have used 99mTc DTPA radioaerosol to measure alteration in pulmonary epithelial permeability (alveolar-capillary membrane) and to image the distribution of ventilation in normal and some pathological states.  Ventilation studies with radioaerosol have been done routinely in Nuclear Medicine Department, Singapore General Hospital since 1986. Clearance measurements of 99mTc DTPA aerosol across the alveolar capillary membrane were done initially in 30 normal volunteers (army personnel). Subsequently in 1987, all patients with burns who were entered into a study protocol for burns also had the radioaerosol clearance study, and 48 patients with suspicion of inhalation burns have been studied. We also studied 10 cigarette smokers to confirm the rapid radioaerosol clearance from the lungs in this group. Twenty young hardcore glue sniffers from the Sembawang Detention Centre were studied to note any alveolarcapillary membrane damage from inhalant abuse. Most of these young men were smokers, and since smoking and glue-sniffing was forbidden at the Centre, we were also able to study the effects of cessation for varying periods, on the clearance rate of the radioaerosol from the lungs in glue-sniffing. In 1988 we participated in a programme with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to image the ventilation of the lung in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with 99mTc tin colloid aerosol, and to compare this with perfusion of the lung using 9SmTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA). We took this opportunity to study also the lung clearance of 99mTc DTPA radioaerosol in 18 of these patients. In these COPD patients we noted the deposition pattern of inhaled radiocolloid aerosol to help differentiate the nature of the obstructive airways disease. X-ray chest was done routinely and all of them had lung function tests done, with only those patients having a FEV 1% of < 70% being entered into the study. The subjects breathe a submicronic aerosol of 11\"'Tc DTPA (I µm mean mass aerodynamic diameter, Ultravent, USA) for 2-3 min after instillation of 20-25 mCi (740-925 MBq) of freshly prepared s9mTc DTPA into the nebuliser. The radioactive solute was prepared by adding the technetium-99m dose in 2 ml physiological saline into a commercial vial of DTPA (Amersham UK), and the binding of 99mTc to DTPA was about 95%, using paper chromatography. The nebuliser was connected to the wall oxygen supply and a flow rate of 10 L/min was used. Immediately following the radioaerosol inhalation in a lying position, a dynamic acquisition was started using an Elscint Apex 409A or ADAC Vertex gamma camera/ computer system with the patient supine and the gammacamera placed posteriorly over the lungs. Twenty frames at 1 minute per frame were acquired over the 20 minute period using a 64 x 64 spatial resolution. Subsequent reframing was done to produce a single reframed image and regions of interest (ROI'S) were drawn around each lung or parts of the lung. Time-activity curves were then obtained for each region/lung and an exponential fit was performed on the time-activity curves from peak to 7 minutes to obtain a clearance half-time (T'/) i.e. time for 50% of the radioaerosol to clear from the lung. Retention images were also generated to note any discrepancy in regional lung clearance of 99\"Tc DTPA aerosol. No corrections were made for contribution of circulating and tissue radioactivity to the total counts detected over the lung field i.e. non-lung parenchymal radioactivity, as this is usually minimal. The ventilation study was generally done within 3 days of admission in the burns patients. Serial studies were done in some patients in hospital and as outpatients. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was usually done within aday of the burns, using an Olympus bronchofibrescope BF Type B2. The severity of damage noted at bronchoscopy was graded as follows: 0 = normal 1 = mild oedema and hyperemia 2 =moderate oedema, hyperemia and secretions 3 = severe oedema, inflammation, ulceration and slough Twelve of the burns patients studied were Koreans who were involved in an ammonia tank explosion on board a ship. The remaining 36 were patients from Singapore who were exposed accidentally to kerosine stove fires or gas explosions, or who had attempted suicide. We treat many patients with differentiated thyroid cancer each year (average 40 per year). Twelve of these patients had lung metastases and had received cumulative radioiodine treatment doses of 500-800 mCi (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) GBq). The aerosol study was done in the morning prior to treatment with radioiodine (off thyroxine for 5 weeks) in the afternoon, the last treatment dose being about six months previously. X-ray chest was done routinely and CT scan of thorax in some of these patients, but pulmonary function tests were not done. None of these patients were smokers. The patients received radioiodine treatment from 8 years previously (6 patients) to 4 years previously (4 patients) and 2 years previously (2 patients). The 12 patients had the aerosol study, to note damage to alveolar-capillary membrane, if any. In the 30 normal, non-smoking adult volunteers, the T'/2 ranged from 47 to 78 minutes with a mean of 66 mins ± l sd 12 mins. The volunteers were aged 18-20 years while the patients were in the 30-45 age group. There were no significant differences in clearance between right and left lung. Table 1 summarizes the findings in the study of normals and in patients with suspected inhalation burns, while Table 2 notes the change in clearance rates over a period of time in three patients with inhalation burns. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the time-activity clearance curves and the retention images in a normal and abnormal study respectively. In the group of 65 patients with suspicion of inhalation injury, only 48 had both bronchoscopy and ventilation study; of these 48, 12 were Korean males in their thirties. They were exposed to ammonia from an ammonia tank explosion on board a ship in the South China Sea and they were flown to the Singapore General Hospital the same day and managed by the Burns Unit in this hospital. An inhalation injury caused by chemicals was presumed and though 15 were transferred from the ship to hospital only 12 were able to have the aerosol studies done. All these twelve also had bronchoscopy done mostly within a day after admission, though in one of them the delay was 5 days. There were 36 local patients, who had both bronchoscopy and ventilation study done. This group of patients was exposed to thermal injury or products of combustion. The retention images in normal subjects showed faster clearance of tracer in the apices and edges of the lung fields. Similarly in the patients with abnormal bronchoscopic findings the ventilation images generally showed patchy radioaerosol distribution in both lungs, while the retention images showed obvious increased regional clearance in only a few patients with high likelihood of lung parenchymal damage. Chest X-rays were normal in most of the patients at tirne of ventilation study, though subsequent films did show evidence of bilateral patchy infiltration (pneumonitis) or oedema, particularly in the basal areas. Pulmonary function measurement was done in only a few patients and no analysis could be done. There was no correlation between the partial pressure of arterial oxygen Pa02, and the grading of bronchoscopic findings or the ventilation study T'/2 results. Table 3 summarizes the results of aerosol deposition pattern and clearance times in patients with COPD. It is to be noted that the radioaerosol deposition tends to be central in patients with emphysema, and more peripheral in bronchitic patients, while a fair number of patients will tend to show a mixed pattern. The X-ray chest can be normal in some of these patients. The mean T'/2 from Tc-99m DTPA clearance in these patients was 78 ± 14 min. The perfusion images largely matched the ventilation images in these patients with COPD. Figures 3, 4 and show patterns of aerosol deposition in moderate and severe COPD, together with clearance curves. In this group, there were 10 smokers (Volunteers), and 20 glue-sniffers from Sembawang Detention Centre. The smokers had an abnormally rapid mean T'/z clearance time of 20 mins; as can be seen from Figure 5 , in the gluesniffers, the longer the period of abstinence from cigarettes, the larger the T'/2clearance times obtained. In only 1 of the glue-sniffers who was always a non-smoker, and stopped glue-sniffing for 30 days, was the T'/2 abnormal i.e. 36 mins, indicating that there is some alveolar-capillary damage in the long-term, in hard-core glue-sniffers. It also appears that the recovery of clearance times to normal on cessation of smoking is prolonged in the gluesniffers, quite apart from any neurological damage. The mean clearance half-time value was 76 ± 23 mins in these 12 thyroid cancer patients with lung metastases and who had received radioiodine treatment. Since the numbers are small it is not possible to make meaningful inference between administered radioiodine dose and 9`Tc DTPA clearance T!/2 time. However only two patients had low T'/2 values (41 min and 49 min) and both these patients had diffuse lung involvement by metastases, compared to the other 10 who had patchy areas of metastatic lung disease. These two patients were given 600 mCi of radioiodine \"'I, over a period of 3 years, and are still continuing with the treatment. Though \"'I uptake in the lungs was measured (mean uptake = 10% at 72 hours), of administered dose) no calculations were made in terms of radiation dose delivered to the lung. Our group of 30 normal volunteers was fairly young i.e. mean age = 19. The mean clearance T'/z obtained was 66 mins, and this is slightly lower than that reported from other centres, where older volunteers were studied. A previous study 6 has shown a variation in clearance T'/2 with age, with younger volunteers showing a more rapid clearance; this accounts for our slightly lower normal values. Cigarette smoking is known to cause increased \"n'Tc DTPA pulmonary clearance,''' and this has been borne out in our study of 10 smokers where the mean T'/Zis considerably reduced to 20 mins. Studies on regular smokers who stopped smoking have shown that the increased clearance rate returned towards normal, with a significant improvement (decreased rate) in T'/2 as early as 24 hours.' However in young hard-core glue-sniffers this does not appear to be so. We have studied the pulmonary clearance in these 20 young men from the Sembawang Detention Centre, where they were off cigarettes and glue-sniffing for periods ranging from I day to 30 days. Unfortunately, owing to transport and detention logistics, there are not many in each group of days off smoking, but it appears that even up to one week, the clearance-rates are faster than normal. As can be seen from Figure 5 , even at four weeks, the clearance-rates are just about approaching the normal range. This indicates that with the superimposition of inhalant abuse on smoking, there is prolonged alteration of the alveolar capillary membrane permeability. Only one out of the 20 men was a regular nonsmoker whom we studied at day 30, and he had an abnormal T'/2 of 36 mins, suggesting altered alveolarcapillary permeability from inhalant abuse alone. The information in Figure 5 can be utilized in anti-smoking clinics and in rehabilitation of glue-sniffers. Over the last 3 years there has been a considerable reduction in glue-sniffing in Singapore with very few admissions to the Detention Centre. Inhalation injuries resulting from fires are uncommon in the lower airways and lung parenchyma, unless there is steam exposure. Chemical injuries to the respiratory tract depend on the chemical involved, the concentration of the chemical, its solubility and duration of exposure. Ammonia for example tends to dissolve in the upper respiratory tract and cause injury there but when the concentration is high or the exposure is prolonged, there may be damage to the lower respiratory tract as evidenced by our study of the 12 patients exposed to an ammonia tank explosion, when both the bronchoscopy and ventilation study showed abnormal findings in 9 of 12 patients. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy, Xenon-133 lung scans and pulmonary functions tests have been useful objective tests in the diagnosis of inhalation burn injury. 10 Bronchoscopy is safe and accurate and it is possible to visualize larynx, trachea, carina and main stem and segmental bronchi. Xenon-133 lung scanning is not available in our part of the world, and is expensive for us to use routinely; hence our decision to use s9mTc DTPA aerosol. Both the radioaerosol and the Xenon lung scan have the limitation of false positives and false negatives in patients with pre-existing lung disease, and if they are smokers. Our patients were healthy young persons who had no proven lung disease previously, though some of them in the ammonia burns group may have been smokers. The damage caused by the ammonia was probably worse than the effects of smoking as proven by the bronchoscopy findings. Pulmonary function tests such as FEV 1 %, and MEFV (maximum expiratory flow volume) were not done routinely as it would have been difficult for most of these patients to cooperate. A previous study done at this hospital 1° did not show any correlation between severity of bronchoscopic changes and PaO, or the severity of the skin burn. The false negative radioaerosol ventilation results are possibly due to this investigation being done one week after the bronchoscopy, while the false positives are either due to effect of smoking, or due to the delayed bronchoscopy being normal 5 days after the ventilation scan. It would appear that the retention images produced to obtain an index of regional lung ventilation and damage, are not useful in most cases. Serial studies in a few patients with lung parenchymal damage from inhalation burns have shown progressive improvement, deterioration, or no change in regional ventilation and clearance times of the radioaerosol, as shown in Table 2 . Most of the Koreans were flown back to Korea soon after the accident and hence it was not possible to get long-term serial studies. Studies using the plain chest film after smoke inhalation,\" have pointed to bronchial wall thickening and subglottic oedema, as heralding more serious respiratory damage both to the upper airways and to the lung parenchyma. We have not been able to correlate the radioaerosol clearance times with the X-ray chest findings. An increase in the rate of submicronic aerosol of Tc-99m DTPA clearance from the lungs has been reported in normal persons breathing at high lung volumes, 12 healthy cigarette smokers,' patients with chronic interstitial lung disease' s and in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome 14 and in assessing lung damage in AIDS. 15 Hence there is a belief that measuring altered respiratory epithelial permeability using clearancerate of SSmTc DTPA radioaerosol is not specific enough for use in the clinical situation.' 6 In otherwise healthy, particularly young patients with no pre-existing lung disease and who are nonsmokers (as is often the case here), there is a useful role for simple radioaerosol studies in assessing the lung parenchymal damage from respiratory burns. Other studies\" stress the need for early diagnosis of the inhalation burn so that adequate treatment may be instituted early. Our preliminary study\" indicated that there was a definite role for DTPA clearance study in suspected inhalation burns, and this has been borne out after more patients have been entered into the study.' 9'20 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) We used a non-diffusible tracer (99mTc (tin) colloid) to image the pattern of ventilation of the lungs in COPD, and compared the inhalation images to the perfusion images that were subsequently acquired using i.v. SSmTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA). In general, the study indicated that in COPD, there were matched ventilation and perfusion abnormalities, confirming that regional ventilation regulates regional perfusion. The deposition patterns of the inhaled aerosol also help in differentiating the nature of the COPD; from the study we noted that the aerosol deposition tended to be central in emphysema, and peripheral in bronchitis, though obviously there will be mixed patterns in some patients. It is possible that abnormal deposition patterns may be noted earlier than changes in X-ray chest' -' The S9mTc DTPA clearance study was done in eight of these patients with COPD; there was no reduction in clearance T'/2. If at all the T'/was slightly increased, due in part to the central tracer deposition with poor clearance from this site. The mean T'/ was 78 mins which is close to our normal range. Previous studies have also shown that COPD per se does not cause an increase in the rate of S9mTc DTPA clearance.\" Further 9SmTc DTPA aerosol clearance studies are also being done as part of a regional coordinated study on the influence of urban air pollution on altered lung function. The initial findings conclude that in cities with high levels of particulate pollutants (Bombay, Bangkok) people have shorter T'/2 times as compared to cities like Sendai and Singapore where atmospheric pollution is low. 22 Thyroid cancer lung metastases Lung metastases from differentiated cancer are not uncommon and are readily treated with radioiodine and thyroxine. The radiation dose delivered to the lung may be quite high, and results in radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis. 23 The late effects from repeated therapeutic doses of radioiodine could damage normal pulmonary epithelium.24 A recent study25 has shown no significant alteration in the T'/2 in 35 patients who had received large cumulative radioiodine dose for lung metastases from thyroid cancer. Our study supports this conclusion, and though pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis may occur, there is no permanent damage to alveolar-capillary membrane as measured by the T'/clearance study. Only in two patients with diffuse lung involvement were there low T'/2 values, but repeat long-term studies have to be done in these 2 patients to note development of radiation induced pulmonary epithelial damage. Other studies have shown interestingly that clearance is accelerated not only in radiation pneumonitic lesions, but also in the contralateral otherwise normal lung. 26 In summary the radioaerosols, including technetium-99m DTPA aerosol, can produce inhalation images of the lung and are usefully sensitive, though not specific, in studying pulmonary epithelial permeability in various types of lung diseases.",

The ventilation study was generally done within 3 days of admission in the burns patients. Serial studies were done in some patients in hospital and as outpatients. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was usually done within aday of the burns, using an Olympus bronchofibrescope BF Type B2. The severity of damage noted at bronchoscopy was graded as follows: 0 = normal 1 = mild oedema and hyperemia 2 =moderate oedema, hyperemia and secretions 3 = severe oedema, inflammation, ulceration and slough Twelve of the burns patients studied were Koreans who were involved in an ammonia tank explosion on board a ship. The remaining 36 were patients from Singapore who were exposed accidentally to kerosine stove fires or gas explosions, or who had attempted suicide. We treat many patients with differentiated thyroid cancer each year (average 40 per year). Twelve of these patients had lung metastases and had received cumulative radioiodine treatment doses of 500-800 mCi (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) GBq). The aerosol study was done in the morning prior to treatment with radioiodine (off thyroxine for 5 weeks) in the afternoon, the last treatment dose being about six months previously. X-ray chest was done routinely and CT scan of thorax in some of these patients, but pulmonary function tests were not done. None of these patients were smokers. The patients received radioiodine treatment from 8 years previously (6 patients) to 4 years previously (4 patients) and 2 years previously (2 patients). The 12 patients had the aerosol study, to note damage to alveolar-capillary membrane, if any. In the 30 normal, non-smoking adult volunteers, the T'/2 ranged from 47 to 78 minutes with a mean of 66 mins ± l sd 12 mins. The volunteers were aged 18-20 years while the patients were in the 30-45 age group. There were no significant differences in clearance between right and left lung. Table 1 summarizes the findings in the study of normals and in patients with suspected inhalation burns, while Table 2 notes the change in clearance rates over a period of time in three patients with inhalation burns. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the time-activity clearance curves and the retention images in a normal and abnormal study respectively. In the group of 65 patients with suspicion of inhalation injury, only 48 had both bronchoscopy and ventilation study; of these 48, 12 were Korean males in their thirties. They were exposed to ammonia from an ammonia tank explosion on board a ship in the South China Sea and they were flown to the Singapore General Hospital the same day and managed by the Burns Unit in this hospital. An inhalation injury caused by chemicals was presumed and though 15 were transferred from the ship to hospital only 12 were able to have the aerosol studies done. All these twelve also had bronchoscopy done mostly within a day after admission, though in one of them the delay was 5 days. There were 36 local patients, who had both bronchoscopy and ventilation study done. This group of patients was exposed to thermal injury or products of combustion. The retention images in normal subjects showed faster clearance of tracer in the apices and edges of the lung fields. Similarly in the patients with abnormal bronchoscopic findings the ventilation images generally showed patchy radioaerosol distribution in both lungs, while the retention images showed obvious increased regional clearance in only a few patients with high likelihood of lung parenchymal damage. Chest X-rays were normal in most of the patients at tirne of ventilation study, though subsequent films did show evidence of bilateral patchy infiltration (pneumonitis) or oedema, particularly in the basal areas. Pulmonary function measurement was done in only a few patients and no analysis could be done. There was no correlation between the partial pressure of arterial oxygen Pa02, and the grading of bronchoscopic findings or the ventilation study T'/2 results. Table 3 summarizes the results of aerosol deposition pattern and clearance times in patients with COPD. It is to be noted that the radioaerosol deposition tends to be central in patients with emphysema, and more peripheral in bronchitic patients, while a fair number of patients will tend to show a mixed pattern. The X-ray chest can be normal in some of these patients. The mean T'/2 from Tc-99m DTPA clearance in these patients was 78 ± 14 min. The perfusion images largely matched the ventilation images in these patients with COPD. Figures 3, 4 and show patterns of aerosol deposition in moderate and severe COPD, together with clearance curves. In this group, there were 10 smokers (Volunteers), and 20 glue-sniffers from Sembawang Detention Centre. The smokers had an abnormally rapid mean T'/z clearance time of 20 mins; as can be seen from Figure 5 , in the gluesniffers, the longer the period of abstinence from cigarettes, the larger the T'/2clearance times obtained. In only 1 of the glue-sniffers who was always a non-smoker, and stopped glue-sniffing for 30 days, was the T'/2 abnormal i.e. 36 mins, indicating that there is some alveolar-capillary damage in the long-term, in hard-core glue-sniffers. It also appears that the recovery of clearance times to normal on cessation of smoking is prolonged in the gluesniffers, quite apart from any neurological damage. The mean clearance half-time value was 76 ± 23 mins in these 12 thyroid cancer patients with lung metastases and who had received radioiodine treatment. Since the numbers are small it is not possible to make meaningful inference between administered radioiodine dose and 9`Tc DTPA clearance T!/2 time. However only two patients had low T'/2 values (41 min and 49 min) and both these patients had diffuse lung involvement by metastases, compared to the other 10 who had patchy areas of metastatic lung disease. These two patients were given 600 mCi of radioiodine \"'I, over a period of 3 years, and are still continuing with the treatment. Though \"'I uptake in the lungs was measured (mean uptake = 10% at 72 hours), of administered dose) no calculations were made in terms of radiation dose delivered to the lung. Our group of 30 normal volunteers was fairly young i.e. mean age = 19. The mean clearance T'/z obtained was 66 mins, and this is slightly lower than that reported from other centres, where older volunteers were studied. A previous study 6 has shown a variation in clearance T'/2 with age, with younger volunteers showing a more rapid clearance; this accounts for our slightly lower normal values. Cigarette smoking is known to cause increased \"n'Tc DTPA pulmonary clearance,''' and this has been borne out in our study of 10 smokers where the mean T'/Zis considerably reduced to 20 mins. Studies on regular smokers who stopped smoking have shown that the increased clearance rate returned towards normal, with a significant improvement (decreased rate) in T'/2 as early as 24 hours.' However in young hard-core glue-sniffers this does not appear to be so. We have studied the pulmonary clearance in these 20 young men from the Sembawang Detention Centre, where they were off cigarettes and glue-sniffing for periods ranging from I day to 30 days. Unfortunately, owing to transport and detention logistics, there are not many in each group of days off smoking, but it appears that even up to one week, the clearance-rates are faster than normal. As can be seen from Figure 5 , even at four weeks, the clearance-rates are just about approaching the normal range. This indicates that with the superimposition of inhalant abuse on smoking, there is prolonged alteration of the alveolar capillary membrane permeability. Only one out of the 20 men was a regular nonsmoker whom we studied at day 30, and he had an abnormal T'/2 of 36 mins, suggesting altered alveolarcapillary permeability from inhalant abuse alone. The information in Figure 5 can be utilized in anti-smoking clinics and in rehabilitation of glue-sniffers. Over the last 3 years there has been a considerable reduction in glue-sniffing in Singapore with very few admissions to the Detention Centre. Inhalation injuries resulting from fires are uncommon in the lower airways and lung parenchyma, unless there is steam exposure. Chemical injuries to the respiratory tract depend on the chemical involved, the concentration of the chemical, its solubility and duration of exposure. Ammonia for example tends to dissolve in the upper respiratory tract and cause injury there but when the concentration is high or the exposure is prolonged, there may be damage to the lower respiratory tract as evidenced by our study of the 12 patients exposed to an ammonia tank explosion, when both the bronchoscopy and ventilation study showed abnormal findings in 9 of 12 patients. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy, Xenon-133 lung scans and pulmonary functions tests have been useful objective tests in the diagnosis of inhalation burn injury. 10 Bronchoscopy is safe and accurate and it is possible to visualize larynx, trachea, carina and main stem and segmental bronchi. Xenon-133 lung scanning is not available in our part of the world, and is expensive for us to use routinely; hence our decision to use s9mTc DTPA aerosol. Both the radioaerosol and the Xenon lung scan have the limitation of false positives and false negatives in patients with pre-existing lung disease, and if they are smokers. Our patients were healthy young persons who had no proven lung disease previously, though some of them in the ammonia burns group may have been smokers. The damage caused by the ammonia was probably worse than the effects of smoking as proven by the bronchoscopy findings. Pulmonary function tests such as FEV 1 %, and MEFV (maximum expiratory flow volume) were not done routinely as it would have been difficult for most of these patients to cooperate. A previous study done at this hospital 1° did not show any correlation between severity of bronchoscopic changes and PaO, or the severity of the skin burn. The false negative radioaerosol ventilation results are possibly due to this investigation being done one week after the bronchoscopy, while the false positives are either due to effect of smoking, or due to the delayed bronchoscopy being normal 5 days after the ventilation scan. It would appear that the retention images produced to obtain an index of regional lung ventilation and damage, are not useful in most cases. Serial studies in a few patients with lung parenchymal damage from inhalation burns have shown progressive improvement, deterioration, or no change in regional ventilation and clearance times of the radioaerosol, as shown in Table 2 . Most of the Koreans were flown back to Korea soon after the accident and hence it was not possible to get long-term serial studies. Studies using the plain chest film after smoke inhalation,\" have pointed to bronchial wall thickening and subglottic oedema, as heralding more serious respiratory damage both to the upper airways and to the lung parenchyma. We have not been able to correlate the radioaerosol clearance times with the X-ray chest findings. An increase in the rate of submicronic aerosol of Tc-99m DTPA clearance from the lungs has been reported in normal persons breathing at high lung volumes, 12 healthy cigarette smokers,' patients with chronic interstitial lung disease' s and in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome 14 and in assessing lung damage in AIDS. 15 Hence there is a belief that measuring altered respiratory epithelial permeability using clearancerate of SSmTc DTPA radioaerosol is not specific enough for use in the clinical situation.' 6 In otherwise healthy, particularly young patients with no pre-existing lung disease and who are nonsmokers (as is often the case here), there is a useful role for simple radioaerosol studies in assessing the lung parenchymal damage from respiratory burns. Other studies\" stress the need for early diagnosis of the inhalation burn so that adequate treatment may be instituted early. Our preliminary study\" indicated that there was a definite role for DTPA clearance study in suspected inhalation burns, and this has been borne out after more patients have been entered into the study.' 9'20 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) We used a non-diffusible tracer (99mTc (tin) colloid) to image the pattern of ventilation of the lungs in COPD, and compared the inhalation images to the perfusion images that were subsequently acquired using i.v. SSmTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA). In general, the study indicated that in COPD, there were matched ventilation and perfusion abnormalities, confirming that regional ventilation regulates regional perfusion. The deposition patterns of the inhaled aerosol also help in differentiating the nature of the COPD; from the study we noted that the aerosol deposition tended to be central in emphysema, and peripheral in bronchitis, though obviously there will be mixed patterns in some patients. It is possible that abnormal deposition patterns may be noted earlier than changes in X-ray chest' -' The S9mTc DTPA clearance study was done in eight of these patients with COPD; there was no reduction in clearance T'/2. If at all the T'/was slightly increased, due in part to the central tracer deposition with poor clearance from this site. The mean T'/ was 78 mins which is close to our normal range. Previous studies have also shown that COPD per se does not cause an increase in the rate of S9mTc DTPA clearance.\" Further 9SmTc DTPA aerosol clearance studies are also being done as part of a regional coordinated study on the influence of urban air pollution on altered lung function. The initial findings conclude that in cities with high levels of particulate pollutants (Bombay, Bangkok) people have shorter T'/2 times as compared to cities like Sendai and Singapore where atmospheric pollution is low. 22 Thyroid cancer lung metastases Lung metastases from differentiated cancer are not uncommon and are readily treated with radioiodine and thyroxine. The radiation dose delivered to the lung may be quite high, and results in radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis. 23 The late effects from repeated therapeutic doses of radioiodine could damage normal pulmonary epithelium.24 A recent study25 has shown no significant alteration in the T'/2 in 35 patients who had received large cumulative radioiodine dose for lung metastases from thyroid cancer. Our study supports this conclusion, and though pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis may occur, there is no permanent damage to alveolar-capillary membrane as measured by the T'/clearance study. Only in two patients with diffuse lung involvement were there low T'/2 values, but repeat long-term studies have to be done in these 2 patients to note development of radiation induced pulmonary epithelial damage. Other studies have shown interestingly that clearance is accelerated not only in radiation pneumonitic lesions, but also in the contralateral otherwise normal lung. 26 In summary the radioaerosols, including technetium-99m DTPA aerosol, can produce inhalation images of the lung and are usefully sensitive, though not specific, in studying pulmonary epithelial permeability in various types of lung diseases.",

         "Smoke inhalation leads to acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating clinical problem associated with high mortality rates. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) is a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling. We have found that adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 ameliorates smoke inhalation-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. We also found that the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was increased post smoke exposure, while oxidized ATP, an inhibitor of purinergic P2X7 receptor, suppressed smoke-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and K(+) efflux. Similar to oxidized ATP, high protein level of SOCS-1 dampened the formation of NALP3 inflammasome and the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β induced by smoke exposure in mouse alveolar macrophages. In conclusion, SOCS-1 relieves smoke inhalation-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury by inhibiting NALP3 inflammasome formation.",

         "Each year, burn-related injuries result in nearly 265,000 deaths globally and 3500 deaths in the USA. Ninety percent of burn-related mortality can be partially attributed to smoke inhalation-associated acute lung injury (SI-ALI). Despite advances in care and rehabilitation of patients with burns, SI-ALI-related mortality remains substantial at 21.3% in 2015 [1] . Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and serious respiratory failure. ALI/ARDS is also a significant clinical problem with no drug treatment currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Because ALI/ARDS patients entering the intensive care unit often have already developed clinical diseases, therapeutics targeting not only the initiation but also the propagation of ALI/ARDS is necessary. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of smokeinduced lung injury can help the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Yet, despite decades of intense research, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced ALI are poorly understood. Smoke directly destroys endothelial and epithelial barrier function and aggregates mucous with sloughed airway epithelium and cellular debris, leading to airway obstruction, change in regional blood flow, increased airway microvascular permeability, exfoliation of epithelial lining, enhanced surfactant denaturation, and toxin/ cytokine-mediated inflammation [2] [3] [4] [5] . The most abundant non-parenchymal cell in the lung is alveolar macrophage, which plays a central role in maintaining normal lung structure and function in both the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and host defense [6, 7] . The inflammatory responses triggered by direct or indirect insults to the lung involve the recruitment and activation of tissue macrophages in the lung parenchyma of ALI/ARDS. Macrophages can be rapidly activated by burn injury to release proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and may therefore play important roles in burn-induced ALI [8, 9] . IL-1β is known as one of the most potent inflammatory initiating cytokines observed in patients suffering from ALI [7] . Macrophage depletion improves alveolar barrier dysfunction and lung inflammatory response caused by severe burns [10] . Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) is a member of the cytokine signaling pathway inhibitor family, which is known as a potent negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling [11, 12] . SOCS-1 is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal proline rich domain called the central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a C-terminal conserved motif named the SOCS box [13] . The SOCS box can couple with SH2 domain-binding proteins to activate ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and thus function as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling [14, 15] . SOCS-1 deletion causes fatal inflammation, which can be rescued by deletion of IFNG [16] . Previously, findings indicate that SOCS-1 is critical in macrophages for preventing uncontrolled inflammation [17] . In LPSinduced ALI, downregulation of SOCS-1 by alveolar macrophages-derived miR-155, which is a proinflammatory factor blinding to 3'-UTR of SOCS-1, remarkably exaggerates lung inflammation [18] . Increased expression of Ad-SOCS-1 has been shown to protect lung from hyperoxic injury by suppressing IL-1β levels [19] . Ad-SOCS-1-infected murine exhibits a lower degree of lymphocytic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis as well as a diminished mortality after bleomycin treatment [20] . However, the role of SOCS-1 in inflammation during smoke inhalation-induced ALI has not been revealed. NALP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein oligomer formed by NALP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and pro-caspase-1. NALP3 also participates in the pathogenesis of ALI [21, 22] . ATP, an NALP3 agonist, acts on P2X7 purinergic receptor (P2RX7) to alter the permeability of the cell membrane, which results in cytosolic K + efflux and the collapse of cation gradient [23] . A drop in cytosolic K + level is a common and sufficient trigger for NALP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation [24] . In response to the rising outflow of K + , the assembly of ASC specks, which are large multimeric complexes predominantly composed of dimers and oligomers of ASC, is activated. This allows procaspase-1 to be recruited and starts the autocatalytic event that ultimately leads to the formation of active caspase-1 heterotetramers and the conversion of inactive cytosolic pro-IL-1β to the functional form [24] [25] [26] [27] . Recent in vitro experiment using alveolar macrophages (AMs) indicates that ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome plays an essential role in burn-induced ALI [7] . Other studies suggest that SOCS-1 may suppress the activity of NALP3, resulting in attenuated encephalomyelitis (EAE) pathogenicity [28] . We therefore hypothesize that SOCS-1 exhibits important effects on smoke inhalation-induced ALI through an anti-inflammatory mechanism. To test our hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice were infected with Ad-SOCS-1 or Ad-GFP by microsprayer. Then, the degree of lung damage and the survival rates were examined after smoke inhalation. Furthermore, to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SOCS-1, we studied both the activation process of the NALP3 inflammasome assembly in response to smoke exposure and the inhibitory action of SOCS-1 on smokeinduced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β expression. C57BL/6 male mice aged 6-8 weeks were obtained from the Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences. All animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Smoke inhalation was administered as previously described [29] . After induction of anesthesia with 5% chloral hydrate 0.01 ml/g (Tianjin Dingshengxin Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., China), mice were briefly placed in the smoke chamber, which was filled with smoke from 300 mg of smoldering cotton heated to 400°C, for 15 min. During smoke exposure, the temperature in the smoke chamber did not exceed 40°C to prevent thermal injury to the airways. All mice were returned to the cages for recovery, which was recorded as day 0. During the experimental period, mice were allowed free access to food and water. Mice were euthanized to collect lung macrophages. Lungs were perfused at 37°C with 1 ml of cold normal saline (NS) 15 times. Lung tissue was placed on a culture plate containing cold RPMI 1640 and then chopped. Cell suspension was filtered twice by a 75-μm steel mesh. Lung macrophages were centrifuged with sterile water to destroy red blood cells. Cells were washed with RPMI 1640. The suspension was then placed in lymphocyte separation medium and centrifuged to obtain lung macrophages. The experimental method is similar to smoke inhalation [30] . Briefly, after isolation of mouse lung macrophages, cells were cultured in six well plates overnight. During smoke exposure, the temperature in the smoke chamber was maintained at 37°C. The smoke was introduced to the cells at a flow rate 25 ml/min using an air sampling pump for 30 min. After completion of the exposure period, the cells were washed using 1 × PBS, and added into the new culture medium with 10% FCS with 5% CO 2 in an incubator at 37°C for 24 h. Cells were digested and collected for subsequent experiments. Twenty-four hours after smoke exposure, the mice were sacrificed and the lungs were collected. Each lung was fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The fixed lungs were then sectioned at 4 μm of thickness, and the tissue was dewaxed in ethanol, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Adenoviral expression vector carrying the coding sequences of the mouse SOCS-1 gene (Ad-SOCS-1) were from ABM Inc. (Richmond, CANADA). Primers were designed and synthesized by TIANGEN BIOTECH (BEIJING) Co., Ltd. SOCS-1 sense: 5'-CACGCACT TCCGCACATTCC-3′ ; SOCS-1 antisense: 5' -TCCAGCAGCTCGAAGAGGCA-3′. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from C57BL/6 mouse liver tissue by Trizol RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen, US). RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) was used to obtain mSOCS-1 cDNA by PrimeScript®RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan). The mSOCS-1 cDNA was cloned into a multicloning site of pHMCMV10. The pAdHM4-SOCS-1 was constructed by ligation of I-CeuI/PI-SceI-digested pAdHM4 and I-CeuI/PI-SceI-digested pHMCMV10-mSOCS-1. To generate the virus, pAdHM4-SOCS-1 was digested with PacI and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized DNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The viruses were amplified in HEK-293 cells. Before virus purification, cell lysates were centrifuged to remove cell debris and digested for 30 min at 37°C with 200 μg/ml DNase I and 200 μg/ml RNase A in the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2 . Viruses were purified by CsCl 2 step gradient ultracentrifugation followed by CsCl 2 linear gradient ultracentrifugation. The purified viruses were dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 10% glycerol. They were then stored at − 80°C. Viral particle (VP) and biological titers were determined by a spectrophotometrical method and by using an Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (BD Clontech, US), respectively. The ratios of the biological-to-particle titer were 1:12 and 1:7 for Ad-SOCS-1 and Ad-GFP (control), respectively. Lung tissue lysates or cell extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-rad, China) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, US). The membranes were washed in 1 × PBS Tween-20 for 20 min and blocked with 5% fat-free milk at room temperature for 2 h. Then they were incubated with SOCS-1 antibody, NALP3, ASC, caspase-1, active caspase-1, or GAPDH antibody (Abcam, China) in TBST containing 5% fat-free milk at 4°C overnight on a gentle shaker. After washing with 1 × PBS Tween-20 for 20 min, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Abcam, China) in TBST containing 3% fat-free milk at room temperature for 2 h according to manufacturer's instruction. Proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (GE, Healthcare, China). Immunoprecipitation was performed using the MPER™ immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce Biotechnology, US). Five hundred micrograms of protein lysate from alveolar macrophages were incubated with anti-NALP3 or anti-ASC antibody (3-5 μg) at 4°C overnight with rocking. The immune complexes were allowed to bind to 40 μL of Recombinant Protein G Agarose beads (Invitrogen, USA) at 4°C for 2 h, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were obtained as immunoprecipitates and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Quantification of ATP was determined by ATP Determination Kit (Thermo Fisher, US). The concentration of extracellular ATP was determined by the culture supernatant. One hundred microliters per well recombinant firefly luciferase (LLR) was added, and the solution was shaken gently. The transmitted light was detected with a luminometer (BioSystems 20/20 luminometer, TURNER), and fluorescence intensity was measured continuously for 5 min [31] . Macrophages were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells per well in 12-well tissue culture dishes and maintained for 24 h. The next day, media were collected at the indicated time points, and cells were washed once with phosphatebuffered saline. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 10% nitric acid. The extracellular (medium) and the intracellular K + content was quantified using atomic absorbance spectroscopy [32] . Data are expressed as mean ± SEM from three or more independent experiments. When comparing between three or more groups, differences were tested using oneway analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test. When comparing between two groups, we used a Student's paired two-tailed t test. Ad-SOCS-1 or Ad-GFP (1 × 10 8 PFU/mouse) was delivered to C57BL/6 mice lung by a microsprayer (Penn-Century, US). Mice lungs and survival were examined after smoke exposure. The overexpression of SOCS-1 was confirmed in mice lungs 72 h after Ad-SOCS-1 infection by western blot (Fig. 1a) . The results showed that transfection of SOCS-1 was successful, and the expression of SOCS-1 in the lung of the Ad-SOCS-1 group was significantly higher than that in Ad-GFP group. After 15 min of smoke inhalation, mice survival was monitored for up to 8 days. Three days after smoke inhalation, all Ad-GFP-administered mice died, while 60% of Ad-SOCS-1-administered mice still lived. Twenty-five percent of Ad-SOCS-1-administered mice even survived up to 8 days, at which point they were sacrificed (Fig. 1b) . The results show that the high expression of SOCS-1 in vivo can significantly improve the survival rate of mice with smoke-induced lung injury. After exposure to smoke for 15 min and a day of rest, mice were sacrificed to observe the degree of lung injury in each group. Ad-GFP mice had obvious lung tissue injury after smoke exposure: lung tissues appeared darkly red with a volume expansion, and lung surface was moist with increased exudation; diffuse hyperemia and edema were visible, and congestion was obviously in some lung tissues. Conversely, in Ad-SOCS-1 mice, lung tissues appeared pink with a smooth and rosy surface; no blood, bleeding spots, congestion, or edema was observed. There was an obvious reduction in lung injury (Fig. 2a) . The results showed that compared to Ad-GFP-infected mice, Ad-SOCS-1-infected mice appeared to have a lower level of lung tissue damage. Thus, SOCS-1 overexpression significantly reduces lung injury caused by smoke inhalation. To further demonstrate that SOCS-1 overexpression can significantly reduce lung injury caused by smoke inhalation, lungs were isolated and lung tissue sections were stained by H&E after infection with or without smoke exposure. Mice were exposed to smoke for 15 min and sacrificed 1 day later. Under optical microscope, in the Ad-GFP mice, the capillaries in the alveolar walls showed swelling and were congested with many red blood cells. Alveolar epithelial cells were edematous. There was visible neutrophil and monocyte infiltration in the pulmonary interstitium. Hemorrhage in the alveolar spaces was found as well. On the contrary, in the Ad-SOCS-1 mice, the lung tissues in the specimens were clear and integral. The alveolar septum was thin and the wall was smooth. There was rarely neutrophil and monocyte infiltration observed in spaces (Fig. 2b) . The results showed that Ad-SOCS1 mice exposed to toxic smoke had a marked decrease in immune cells infiltration. It is confirmed that SOCS-1 overexpression can significantly reduce smoke inhalation-caused lung injury. ATP activates the NALP3 inflammasome through P2X7 receptor mediated K + efflux [32, 33] . To determine whether smoke exposure affects ATP, an important activator of NALP3, alveolar macrophages isolated from non-infected mice lungs were treated with or without smoke for 30 min, and the extracellular concentration of ATP was analyzed 60 min after the end of smoke treatment. Compared to non-treated macrophages, smoke-treated macrophages displayed a significant upsurge in ATP release of approximately 25 ± 2.01 nM/10 6 cells (Fig. 3a) . To determine whether smoke affects cytoplasmic K + level, we detected both extracellular and intracellular K + concentrations up to 60 min after smoke exposure by atomic absorption flame photometry with or without oxidized ATP (oxATP), a P2RX7 antagonist, and observed that oxATP reduced smoke-induced K + efflux (Fig. 3b, c) . Before exposure to smoke, the extracellular K + baseline level of macrophages was 100 nM/well (Fig. 3b) , and the intracellular K + baseline level was 400 nM/well (Fig. 3c) . After exposure to smoke, there was about an 80% decrease in the intracellular K + concentration, while the extracellular K + level was surged to 400 nM/well. The depletion of cytoplasmic K + was detected within 20 min and was maintained for 60 min after inhalation of smoke. These results show that smoke-induced K + efflux through interacting with P2RX7 (Fig. 3b, c) . To determine whether P2RX7 is required for smokeinduced inflammasome activation, isolated macrophages were pretreated with oxATP and exposed to smoke or air for 30 min. Immunoblotting revealed that smoke significantly increased the protein level of NALP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1. OxATP reduced smoke-mediated caspase-1 activation but not smoke-induced NALP3 and ASC expression (Fig. 3d) . Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-ASC antibody and the quantifications of relative protein expression analyzed by the intensity of the signals affirmed that oxATP suppresses the interaction between ASC and NALP3 enhanced by smoke (Fig. 3e) . This indicates that P2RX7 is a necessary component of smoke-increased NALP3 inflammasome assembly (Fig. 3d, e) . To determine whether SOCS-1 reduces ATP and K + efflux induced by smoke, alveolar macrophages isolated from Ad-SOCS-1 mice lungs were treated with or without smoke for 30 min, and the extracellular concentration of ATP was analyzed 60 min after the end of smoke treatment. Macrophages from the lungs of Ad-SOCS-1 mice showed a significant decrease in ATP release compared to Ad-GFP mice alveolar macrophages (Fig. 4a) . We also detected both extracellular and intracellular K + concentrations up to 30 min after smoke and observed that macrophages from Ad-SOCS-1-infected mice exhibited a lower degree of K + efflux than those from Ad-GFP-infected mice (Fig. 4b, c) . To test whether SOCS-1 exerts anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of NALP3 inflammasome formation and consequent activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β, Ad-GFP, or Ad-SOCS-1-adminstered mice were exposed to smoke for 15 min and euthanized 1 day later to collect alveolar macrophages. Immunoblotting i ndicat ed that overexpression of SOCS-1 helped macrophages resist smoke-enhanced caspase-1 cleavage. Additionally, the amount of ASC protein pulled down with NALP3 was detected after immunoprecipitation with anti-NALP3 antibody. The results indicate that SOCS-1 repressed smokeinduced interaction between NALP3 and ASC (Fig. 5a) . We also explored caspase-1 activity and IL-1β level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found that compared to the macrophages in smoke-treated Ad-GFPinfected mice, the macrophages in smoke-treated Ad-SOCS-1-infected mice had lower levels of both caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion (Fig. 5b) . Our study demonstrates that SOCS-1 obstructs smoke-activated NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 cleavage, and IL-1β secretion. This study aims to identify the role of SOCS-1 in smoke inhalation-induced ALI. The results reveal that SOCS-1 attenuates ALI resulting from smoke exposure by suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammation. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of SOCS-1 to mice attenuates smoke exposure-induced ALI and improves the survival of mice. Additionally, smoke-enhanced ATP release promotes NALP3 inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation through the stimulation of P2RX7-mediated K + efflux. Finally, adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 blocks ATP and K + efflux to diminish NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β expression prompted by smoke in macrophages (Fig. 6) . Previous reports indicate that SOCS-1 plays an important role in preventing inflammation. SOCS-1 is critical for preventing lethal inflammation in T cells and macrophages, and deficiency of SOCS-1 results in spontaneous inflammation [17] . SOCS-1 in adaptive immune cells inhibits antiviral immunity, and its presence in innate/stromal cells is responsible for aggravated lung damage [34] . SOCS-1-deficient mice die within 3 weeks of birth with severe inflammation and lung damage through infiltration Fig. 2 . Reduced degree of smoke inhalation-induced lung injury in Ad-SOCS-1-treated mice. Mice infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-SOCS-1 were exposed to smoke for 15 min. After 1 day, a the degree of lung injury was observed in each group, and b lung tissue sections stained by H&E were observed to study morphological alternation (magnification ×400). of inflammatory cells [20] . Compared to control mice, mice with overexpression of SOCS-1 exposed to hyperoxia show a significant amelioration in inflammation and alveolar damage [35] . As is shown in our results and other reports, smoke exposure can lead to ALI and result in inflammation and alveolar damage [36, 37] . Mice with Ad- Fig. 3 . The requirement of P2RX7 in smoke exposure-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 cleavage. Alveolar macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 mice, treated with or without oxATP, exposed to smoke for 30 min, and then analyzed for a ATP release, b extracellular, and c intracellular K + levels, d expression of inflammasome components NALP3, ASC, and caspase-1, and e the complex formed by NALP3 and ASC.

Isolated alveolar macrophages were analyzed for a ATP release and b intracellular and c extracellular K + levels.(P < 0.01 vs. the Ad-GFP group). GFP exposed to smoke all died within 3 days and the lung tissue showed lung tissue damage and immune cells invasion. However, survival rates and these pathological changes were significantly ameliorated in Ad-SOCS-1 mice. Galam et al. show that SOCS-1 overexpression inhibits ASK-1 and suppresses IL-1β levels to restore lung tissue in HALI [19] . Therefore, we speculate that ASK-1 may participate in inflammation of lung injury induced by smoke and interact with SOCS-1 in this process. 5 . Negative regulation of SOCS-1 on smoke-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β expression. Ad-GFP or Ad-SOCS-1-treated mice were exposed to smoke for 15 min and allowed to rest for 1 day. Isolated alveolar macrophages were analyzed for a NALP3 inflammasome assembly and b caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion. NALP3 inflammasome is activated and the inflammatory cascade is triggered with subsequent fibrosis in crystalline silica-induced lung injury [38] . Bleomycininduced inflammation and fibrosis of ALI also require activation of NALP3 [39] . Using the mouse model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) in the lungs, HS activates lung endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase through high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS then promotes association of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) w i t h N A L P 3 a n d s u b s e q u e n t a c t i v a t i o n o f inflammasome and IL-1β secretion [40] . NALP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β cleavage are induced by hyperoxia both in vivo and in vitro [32, 33, 41, 42] . In the hyperoxia-induced lung injury mice model, hyperoxia can induce ATP efflux. The elevated extracellular ATP interacts with P2X7 receptors, causing K + efflux and activation of NALP3 inflammasome [43] . Likewise, our results show that smoke-induced ATP promotes inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation through stimulation of P2X7 receptorinduced K + efflux. Previous study investigating the effect of NALP3 on an inflammatory disease, EAE, demonstrates that IFNAR (the shared receptor for IFNα and IFN-β) signaling in macrophages induces SOCS-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation to decrease the production of mitochondrial ROS, resulting in inhibition of NALP3 inflammasome activity [28] . Our results indicate that SOCS-1 reduces NALP3 inflammasome formation through repression of the smoke-induced interaction between NALP3 and ASC, which thereby inhibits caspase-1 and IL-1β activated by NALP3. Recent reports also indicate that Cobalt protoporphyrin induces COX-2 expression by activation of P2X7 receptors, ASK-1/MAP kinases, and STAT-1 degradation signaling pathways [44] . Therefore, there may be a relationship between ASK-1 and P2RX7 that leads to the formation of NALP3 in smoke-induced ALI, which we will further investigate in the future. In summary, SOCS-1 significantly ameliorates smokeinduced ALI. The protective mechanism of SOCS-1 from smoke-induced ALI is associated with a reduction in inflammation. These studies are the first to demonstrate that SOCS-1 is a critical regulator of smoke inhalation-induced ALI and a key mediator in inflammation protection. SOCS-1 may lead to the discovery of anchor points for new treatment strategies for smoke-induced ALI.

         "SOCS-1 Suppresses Inflammation Through Inhibition of NALP3 Inflammasome Formation in Smoke Inhalation-Induced Acute Lung Injury. Smoke inhalation leads to acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating clinical problem associated with high mortality rates. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) is a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling. We have found that adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 ameliorates smoke inhalation-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. We also found that the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was increased post smoke exposure, while oxidized ATP, an inhibitor of purinergic P2X7 receptor, suppressed smoke-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and K(+) efflux. Similar to oxidized ATP, high protein level of SOCS-1 dampened the formation of NALP3 inflammasome and the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β induced by smoke exposure in mouse alveolar macrophages. In conclusion, SOCS-1 relieves smoke inhalation-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury by inhibiting NALP3 inflammasome formation.. Each year, burn-related injuries result in nearly 265,000 deaths globally and 3500 deaths in the USA. Ninety percent of burn-related mortality can be partially attributed to smoke inhalation-associated acute lung injury (SI-ALI). Despite advances in care and rehabilitation of patients with burns, SI-ALI-related mortality remains substantial at 21.3% in 2015 [1] . Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and serious respiratory failure. ALI/ARDS is also a significant clinical problem with no drug treatment currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Because ALI/ARDS patients entering the intensive care unit often have already developed clinical diseases, therapeutics targeting not only the initiation but also the propagation of ALI/ARDS is necessary. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of smokeinduced lung injury can help the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Yet, despite decades of intense research, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced ALI are poorly understood. Smoke directly destroys endothelial and epithelial barrier function and aggregates mucous with sloughed airway epithelium and cellular debris, leading to airway obstruction, change in regional blood flow, increased airway microvascular permeability, exfoliation of epithelial lining, enhanced surfactant denaturation, and toxin/ cytokine-mediated inflammation [2] [3] [4] [5] . The most abundant non-parenchymal cell in the lung is alveolar macrophage, which plays a central role in maintaining normal lung structure and function in both the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and host defense [6, 7] . The inflammatory responses triggered by direct or indirect insults to the lung involve the recruitment and activation of tissue macrophages in the lung parenchyma of ALI/ARDS. Macrophages can be rapidly activated by burn injury to release proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and may therefore play important roles in burn-induced ALI [8, 9] . IL-1β is known as one of the most potent inflammatory initiating cytokines observed in patients suffering from ALI [7] . Macrophage depletion improves alveolar barrier dysfunction and lung inflammatory response caused by severe burns [10] . Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) is a member of the cytokine signaling pathway inhibitor family, which is known as a potent negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling [11, 12] . SOCS-1 is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal proline rich domain called the central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a C-terminal conserved motif named the SOCS box [13] . The SOCS box can couple with SH2 domain-binding proteins to activate ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and thus function as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling [14, 15] . SOCS-1 deletion causes fatal inflammation, which can be rescued by deletion of IFNG [16] . Previously, findings indicate that SOCS-1 is critical in macrophages for preventing uncontrolled inflammation [17] . In LPSinduced ALI, downregulation of SOCS-1 by alveolar macrophages-derived miR-155, which is a proinflammatory factor blinding to 3'-UTR of SOCS-1, remarkably exaggerates lung inflammation [18] . Increased expression of Ad-SOCS-1 has been shown to protect lung from hyperoxic injury by suppressing IL-1β levels [19] . Ad-SOCS-1-infected murine exhibits a lower degree of lymphocytic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis as well as a diminished mortality after bleomycin treatment [20] . However, the role of SOCS-1 in inflammation during smoke inhalation-induced ALI has not been revealed. NALP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein oligomer formed by NALP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and pro-caspase-1. NALP3 also participates in the pathogenesis of ALI [21, 22] . ATP, an NALP3 agonist, acts on P2X7 purinergic receptor (P2RX7) to alter the permeability of the cell membrane, which results in cytosolic K + efflux and the collapse of cation gradient [23] . A drop in cytosolic K + level is a common and sufficient trigger for NALP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation [24] . In response to the rising outflow of K + , the assembly of ASC specks, which are large multimeric complexes predominantly composed of dimers and oligomers of ASC, is activated. This allows procaspase-1 to be recruited and starts the autocatalytic event that ultimately leads to the formation of active caspase-1 heterotetramers and the conversion of inactive cytosolic pro-IL-1β to the functional form [24] [25] [26] [27] . Recent in vitro experiment using alveolar macrophages (AMs) indicates that ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome plays an essential role in burn-induced ALI [7] . Other studies suggest that SOCS-1 may suppress the activity of NALP3, resulting in attenuated encephalomyelitis (EAE) pathogenicity [28] . We therefore hypothesize that SOCS-1 exhibits important effects on smoke inhalation-induced ALI through an anti-inflammatory mechanism. To test our hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice were infected with Ad-SOCS-1 or Ad-GFP by microsprayer. Then, the degree of lung damage and the survival rates were examined after smoke inhalation. Furthermore, to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SOCS-1, we studied both the activation process of the NALP3 inflammasome assembly in response to smoke exposure and the inhibitory action of SOCS-1 on smokeinduced NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β expression. C57BL/6 male mice aged 6-8 weeks were obtained from the Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences. All animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Smoke inhalation was administered as previously described [29] . After induction of anesthesia with 5% chloral hydrate 0.01 ml/g (Tianjin Dingshengxin Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., China), mice were briefly placed in the smoke chamber, which was filled with smoke from 300 mg of smoldering cotton heated to 400°C, for 15 min. During smoke exposure, the temperature in the smoke chamber did not exceed 40°C to prevent thermal injury to the airways. All mice were returned to the cages for recovery, which was recorded as day 0. During the experimental period, mice were allowed free access to food and water. Mice were euthanized to collect lung macrophages. Lungs were perfused at 37°C with 1 ml of cold normal saline (NS) 15 times. Lung tissue was placed on a culture plate containing cold RPMI 1640 and then chopped. Cell suspension was filtered twice by a 75-μm steel mesh. Lung macrophages were centrifuged with sterile water to destroy red blood cells. Cells were washed with RPMI 1640. The suspension was then placed in lymphocyte separation medium and centrifuged to obtain lung macrophages. The experimental method is similar to smoke inhalation [30] . Briefly, after isolation of mouse lung macrophages, cells were cultured in six well plates overnight. During smoke exposure, the temperature in the smoke chamber was maintained at 37°C. The smoke was introduced to the cells at a flow rate 25 ml/min using an air sampling pump for 30 min. After completion of the exposure period, the cells were washed using 1 × PBS, and added into the new culture medium with 10% FCS with 5% CO 2 in an incubator at 37°C for 24 h. Cells were digested and collected for subsequent experiments. Twenty-four hours after smoke exposure, the mice were sacrificed and the lungs were collected. Each lung was fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The fixed lungs were then sectioned at 4 μm of thickness, and the tissue was dewaxed in ethanol, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Adenoviral expression vector carrying the coding sequences of the mouse SOCS-1 gene (Ad-SOCS-1) were from ABM Inc. (Richmond, CANADA). Primers were designed and synthesized by TIANGEN BIOTECH (BEIJING) Co., Ltd. SOCS-1 sense: 5'-CACGCACT TCCGCACATTCC-3′ ; SOCS-1 antisense: 5' -TCCAGCAGCTCGAAGAGGCA-3′. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from C57BL/6 mouse liver tissue by Trizol RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen, US). RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) was used to obtain mSOCS-1 cDNA by PrimeScript®RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan). The mSOCS-1 cDNA was cloned into a multicloning site of pHMCMV10. The pAdHM4-SOCS-1 was constructed by ligation of I-CeuI/PI-SceI-digested pAdHM4 and I-CeuI/PI-SceI-digested pHMCMV10-mSOCS-1. To generate the virus, pAdHM4-SOCS-1 was digested with PacI and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized DNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The viruses were amplified in HEK-293 cells. Before virus purification, cell lysates were centrifuged to remove cell debris and digested for 30 min at 37°C with 200 μg/ml DNase I and 200 μg/ml RNase A in the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2 . Viruses were purified by CsCl 2 step gradient ultracentrifugation followed by CsCl 2 linear gradient ultracentrifugation. The purified viruses were dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 10% glycerol. They were then stored at − 80°C. Viral particle (VP) and biological titers were determined by a spectrophotometrical method and by using an Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (BD Clontech, US), respectively. The ratios of the biological-to-particle titer were 1:12 and 1:7 for Ad-SOCS-1 and Ad-GFP (control), respectively. Lung tissue lysates or cell extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-rad, China) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, US). The membranes were washed in 1 × PBS Tween-20 for 20 min and blocked with 5% fat-free milk at room temperature for 2 h. Then they were incubated with SOCS-1 antibody, NALP3, ASC, caspase-1, active caspase-1, or GAPDH antibody (Abcam, China) in TBST containing 5% fat-free milk at 4°C overnight on a gentle shaker. After washing with 1 × PBS Tween-20 for 20 min, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Abcam, China) in TBST containing 3% fat-free milk at room temperature for 2 h according to manufacturer's instruction. Proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (GE, Healthcare, China). Immunoprecipitation was performed using the MPER™ immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce Biotechnology, US). Five hundred micrograms of protein lysate from alveolar macrophages were incubated with anti-NALP3 or anti-ASC antibody (3-5 μg) at 4°C overnight with rocking. The immune complexes were allowed to bind to 40 μL of Recombinant Protein G Agarose beads (Invitrogen, USA) at 4°C for 2 h, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were obtained as immunoprecipitates and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Quantification of ATP was determined by ATP Determination Kit (Thermo Fisher, US). The concentration of extracellular ATP was determined by the culture supernatant. One hundred microliters per well recombinant firefly luciferase (LLR) was added, and the solution was shaken gently. The transmitted light was detected with a luminometer (BioSystems 20/20 luminometer, TURNER), and fluorescence intensity was measured continuously for 5 min [31] . Macrophages were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells per well in 12-well tissue culture dishes and maintained for 24 h. The next day, media were collected at the indicated time points, and cells were washed once with phosphatebuffered saline. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 10% nitric acid. The extracellular (medium) and the intracellular K + content was quantified using atomic absorbance spectroscopy [32] . Data are expressed as mean ± SEM from three or more independent experiments. When comparing between three or more groups, differences were tested using oneway analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test. When comparing between two groups, we used a Student's paired two-tailed t test. Ad-SOCS-1 or Ad-GFP (1 × 10 8 PFU/mouse) was delivered to C57BL/6 mice lung by a microsprayer (Penn-Century, US). Mice lungs and survival were examined after smoke exposure. The overexpression of SOCS-1 was confirmed in mice lungs 72 h after Ad-SOCS-1 infection by western blot (Fig. 1a) . The results showed that transfection of SOCS-1 was successful, and the expression of SOCS-1 in the lung of the Ad-SOCS-1 group was significantly higher than that in Ad-GFP group. After 15 min of smoke inhalation, mice survival was monitored for up to 8 days. Three days after smoke inhalation, all Ad-GFP-administered mice died, while 60% of Ad-SOCS-1-administered mice still lived. Twenty-five percent of Ad-SOCS-1-administered mice even survived up to 8 days, at which point they were sacrificed (Fig. 1b) . The results show that the high expression of SOCS-1 in vivo can significantly improve the survival rate of mice with smoke-induced lung injury. After exposure to smoke for 15 min and a day of rest, mice were sacrificed to observe the degree of lung injury in each group. Ad-GFP mice had obvious lung tissue injury after smoke exposure: lung tissues appeared darkly red with a volume expansion, and lung surface was moist with increased exudation; diffuse hyperemia and edema were visible, and congestion was obviously in some lung tissues. Conversely, in Ad-SOCS-1 mice, lung tissues appeared pink with a smooth and rosy surface; no blood, bleeding spots, congestion, or edema was observed. There was an obvious reduction in lung injury (Fig. 2a) . The results showed that compared to Ad-GFP-infected mice, Ad-SOCS-1-infected mice appeared to have a lower level of lung tissue damage. Thus, SOCS-1 overexpression significantly reduces lung injury caused by smoke inhalation. To further demonstrate that SOCS-1 overexpression can significantly reduce lung injury caused by smoke inhalation, lungs were isolated and lung tissue sections were stained by H&E after infection with or without smoke exposure. Mice were exposed to smoke for 15 min and sacrificed 1 day later. Under optical microscope, in the Ad-GFP mice, the capillaries in the alveolar walls showed swelling and were congested with many red blood cells. Alveolar epithelial cells were edematous. There was visible neutrophil and monocyte infiltration in the pulmonary interstitium. Hemorrhage in the alveolar spaces was found as well. On the contrary, in the Ad-SOCS-1 mice, the lung tissues in the specimens were clear and integral. The alveolar septum was thin and the wall was smooth. There was rarely neutrophil and monocyte infiltration observed in spaces (Fig. 2b) . The results showed that Ad-SOCS1 mice exposed to toxic smoke had a marked decrease in immune cells infiltration. It is confirmed that SOCS-1 overexpression can significantly reduce smoke inhalation-caused lung injury. ATP activates the NALP3 inflammasome through P2X7 receptor mediated K + efflux [32, 33] . To determine whether smoke exposure affects ATP, an important activator of NALP3, alveolar macrophages isolated from non-infected mice lungs were treated with or without smoke for 30 min, and the extracellular concentration of ATP was analyzed 60 min after the end of smoke treatment. Compared to non-treated macrophages, smoke-treated macrophages displayed a significant upsurge in ATP release of approximately 25 ± 2.01 nM/10 6 cells (Fig. 3a) . To determine whether smoke affects cytoplasmic K + level, we detected both extracellular and intracellular K + concentrations up to 60 min after smoke exposure by atomic absorption flame photometry with or without oxidized ATP (oxATP), a P2RX7 antagonist, and observed that oxATP reduced smoke-induced K + efflux (Fig. 3b, c) . Before exposure to smoke, the extracellular K + baseline level of macrophages was 100 nM/well (Fig. 3b) , and the intracellular K + baseline level was 400 nM/well (Fig. 3c) . After exposure to smoke, there was about an 80% decrease in the intracellular K + concentration, while the extracellular K + level was surged to 400 nM/well. The depletion of cytoplasmic K + was detected within 20 min and was maintained for 60 min after inhalation of smoke. These results show that smoke-induced K + efflux through interacting with P2RX7 (Fig. 3b, c) . To determine whether P2RX7 is required for smokeinduced inflammasome activation, isolated macrophages were pretreated with oxATP and exposed to smoke or air for 30 min. Immunoblotting revealed that smoke significantly increased the protein level of NALP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1. OxATP reduced smoke-mediated caspase-1 activation but not smoke-induced NALP3 and ASC expression (Fig. 3d) . Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-ASC antibody and the quantifications of relative protein expression analyzed by the intensity of the signals affirmed that oxATP suppresses the interaction between ASC and NALP3 enhanced by smoke (Fig. 3e) . This indicates that P2RX7 is a necessary component of smoke-increased NALP3 inflammasome assembly (Fig. 3d, e) . To determine whether SOCS-1 reduces ATP and K + efflux induced by smoke, alveolar macrophages isolated from Ad-SOCS-1 mice lungs were treated with or without smoke for 30 min, and the extracellular concentration of ATP was analyzed 60 min after the end of smoke treatment. Macrophages from the lungs of Ad-SOCS-1 mice showed a significant decrease in ATP release compared to Ad-GFP mice alveolar macrophages (Fig. 4a) . We also detected both extracellular and intracellular K + concentrations up to 30 min after smoke and observed that macrophages from Ad-SOCS-1-infected mice exhibited a lower degree of K + efflux than those from Ad-GFP-infected mice (Fig. 4b, c) . To test whether SOCS-1 exerts anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of NALP3 inflammasome formation and consequent activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β, Ad-GFP, or Ad-SOCS-1-adminstered mice were exposed to smoke for 15 min and euthanized 1 day later to collect alveolar macrophages. Immunoblotting i ndicat ed that overexpression of SOCS-1 helped macrophages resist smoke-enhanced caspase-1 cleavage. Additionally, the amount of ASC protein pulled down with NALP3 was detected after immunoprecipitation with anti-NALP3 antibody. The results indicate that SOCS-1 repressed smokeinduced interaction between NALP3 and ASC (Fig. 5a) . We also explored caspase-1 activity and IL-1β level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found that compared to the macrophages in smoke-treated Ad-GFPinfected mice, the macrophages in smoke-treated Ad-SOCS-1-infected mice had lower levels of both caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion (Fig. 5b) . Our study demonstrates that SOCS-1 obstructs smoke-activated NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 cleavage, and IL-1β secretion. This study aims to identify the role of SOCS-1 in smoke inhalation-induced ALI. The results reveal that SOCS-1 attenuates ALI resulting from smoke exposure by suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammation. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of SOCS-1 to mice attenuates smoke exposure-induced ALI and improves the survival of mice. Additionally, smoke-enhanced ATP release promotes NALP3 inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation through the stimulation of P2RX7-mediated K + efflux. Finally, adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 blocks ATP and K + efflux to diminish NALP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β expression prompted by smoke in macrophages (Fig. 6) .

GFP exposed to smoke all died within 3 days and the lung tissue showed lung tissue damage and immune cells invasion. However, survival rates and these pathological changes were significantly ameliorated in Ad-SOCS-1 mice. Galam et al. show that SOCS-1 overexpression inhibits ASK-1 and suppresses IL-1β levels to restore lung tissue in HALI [19] . Therefore, we speculate that ASK-1 may participate in inflammation of lung injury induced by smoke and interact with SOCS-1 in this process. 5 .

Isolated alveolar macrophages were analyzed for a NALP3 inflammasome assembly and b caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion. NALP3 inflammasome is activated and the inflammatory cascade is triggered with subsequent fibrosis in crystalline silica-induced lung injury [38] . Bleomycininduced inflammation and fibrosis of ALI also require activation of NALP3 [39] . Using the mouse model of hemorrhagic shock (HS) in the lungs, HS activates lung endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase through high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS then promotes association of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) w i t h N A L P 3 a n d s u b s e q u e n t a c t i v a t i o n o f inflammasome and IL-1β secretion [40] . NALP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β cleavage are induced by hyperoxia both in vivo and in vitro [32, 33, 41, 42] . In the hyperoxia-induced lung injury mice model, hyperoxia can induce ATP efflux. The elevated extracellular ATP interacts with P2X7 receptors, causing K + efflux and activation of NALP3 inflammasome [43] . Likewise, our results show that smoke-induced ATP promotes inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation through stimulation of P2X7 receptorinduced K + efflux. Previous study investigating the effect of NALP3 on an inflammatory disease, EAE, demonstrates that IFNAR (the shared receptor for IFNα and IFN-β) signaling in macrophages induces SOCS-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation to decrease the production of mitochondrial ROS, resulting in inhibition of NALP3 inflammasome activity [28] . Our results indicate that SOCS-1 reduces NALP3 inflammasome formation through repression of the smoke-induced interaction between NALP3 and ASC, which thereby inhibits caspase-1 and IL-1β activated by NALP3. Recent reports also indicate that Cobalt protoporphyrin induces COX-2 expression by activation of P2X7 receptors, ASK-1/MAP kinases, and STAT-1 degradation signaling pathways [44] . Therefore, there may be a relationship between ASK-1 and P2RX7 that leads to the formation of NALP3 in smoke-induced ALI, which we will further investigate in the future. In summary, SOCS-1 significantly ameliorates smokeinduced ALI. The protective mechanism of SOCS-1 from smoke-induced ALI is associated with a reduction in inflammation. These studies are the first to demonstrate that SOCS-1 is a critical regulator of smoke inhalation-induced ALI and a key mediator in inflammation protection. SOCS-1 may lead to the discovery of anchor points for new treatment strategies for smoke-induced ALI.

         "Levels of IL-8 and myeloperoxidase in the lungs of pneumonia patients",
         "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is considered as the major polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) chemoattractant cytokine in lung diseases such as asthma and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, controversial results were obtained regarding the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. This study examines the role of IL-8 in the recruitment and activation of PMNs in the lung of pneumonia patients. The interesting aspect of this study is that it is a site- specific analysis of the infected and uninfected lungs of the same patient. The level of IL-8 mRNA, protein and myeloperoxidase present in the cells of the bronchioalveolar lavages (BALs) taken from the areas of known pneumonic consolidations on chest X-ray (infected lung) are compared with the BALs obtained from areas of no obvious infiltrate (non-infected lung). The results obtained from the infected and non-infected lungs of pneumonic patients were further compared with that of a control group of non-smoking patients. The level of IL-8 mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. There was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). This pattern was also consistent with MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung), indicating that IL-8 is directly implicated in neutrophil accumulation that follows acute respiratory infection. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",

         "Chemokines constitute a large family of regulatory cytokines that play a central role in immunological processes. The accumulation and appearance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the tissue may be considered as an initial marker of acute inflammatory reaction [1] . Neutrophils participate in the host response to a number of infectious and non-infectious diseases and in leukocyte migration [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . They contain cytoplasmic granules that function in storage of bioactive neuromolecules (specific or secondary granules) or in fusion with phagosomes (azurophilic or primary granules). The azurophilic granules contain a variety of enzymes including myeloperoxidase, muraminidase, cathepsin A, D, E, G, 5′-nucleotidase, β-galactosidase, elastase, collagenase, azurocidin and the defensins HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, arylsulfatase, α-mannosidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, β-glucuronidase, acid β-glycerophosphatase and cationic peptides. The specific granules on the other hand contain vitamin-B 12 -binding protein, neutral proteases, lactoferrin, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, and probably collagenase [7] . Although the mechanisms that regulate the release of substances from both the granules are almost the same, there are certain specific stimuli such as IL-8 and zymosan that induce the release of substances from secondary granules [8] . Thus IL-8 functions as a potent chemotacting as well as degranulating agent. Recently it has been shown that depletion of neutrophils using anti-rat neutrophil antiserum reduced subsequent development of chronic delayed type hypersensitivity reactions [9] . This study clearly demonstrates the importance of neutrophil derived factors for monocyte and lymphocyte mobilization. Furthermore, it is shown that neutrophils produce a number of low molecular weight factors such as leukotriene B4 (L BT4) that attract more neutrophils and monocytes to the inflammatory site [10] . T-lymphocytes have also been shown to migrate in response to IL-8 both in vivo and in vitro [11, 12] . There is a clear involvement of IL-8 in the pathophysiology of various respiratory diseases [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In asthma, airway inflammation with eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils is a characteristic feature [18] [19] [20] . In correlation with this cellular migration, there is an increase in the level of IL-8 in the serum, tissue and BAL of asthmatics. Similar to that in asthma, the involvement of IL-8 has been well investigated in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the role of interleukin in the development of pneumonia is controversial [21] . Although, an increase in the level of IL-8 is a good indication of the inflammatory process, this information does not contribute much to clinical diagnosis. To our knowledge, no data is available on the production of IL-8 in BAL fluid from the same patient (i.e. infected and non-infected lung). Therefore this study is designed to measure the site-specific increase in the level of IL-8 in the lung of patients with bacterial pneumonia as compared to that of the non-smoking control group. The level of IL-8 mRNA and protein present in the BAL obtained from subsegmental bronchi of experimental and control group of patients were determined by RT-PCR assay and enzyme immunoassay respectively. In this study we also determined the level of myeloperoxidase activity in the cells collected from 1 ml of BAL each from the infected and non-infected lung. Myeloperoxidase, a secreted heme protein, is an attractive candidate for monitoring phagocyte mediated cellular damage [22, 23] . The study was performed on 36 patients with bacterial pneumonia who were admitted to the Chest Diseases Hospital in Kuwait. All patients underwent medical and laboratory examinations. The control group consisted of 17 non-smoking patients among which 9 patients were with chronic cough, 3 with hemoptysis and normal chest X-ray and 5 with old fibrotic shadows (Table 1) . BALs were obtained first from the area of known pneumonic consolidations on chest X-ray (infected lung) followed by BALs from other areas with no obvious infiltrate (non-infected lung) of the same patient. BAL fluids were collected from the pneumonic patient and the control group after admission to the hospital, using sterile techniques and routine respiratory care. The bronchoscope was advanced into a subsegmental bronchus. Lavage was performed using 20 ml aliquots of warmed normal saline, introduced by a syringe through bronchoscopic aspiration port. A total volume of 100-120 ml saline was infused sequentially and the volume of the lavage fluid retrieval (approximately 60 ml) was pooled and transferred immediately into sterile pre-chilled polypropylene tubes. The pooled fluid was then filtered through one layer of sterile gauze and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Following centrifugation, 5 ml of supernatant was taken into a sterile polypropylene tube and stored at -70°C until assayed. Total RNA was extracted from cells contained in 1 ml of the BAL obtained from the infected and non-infected lung, using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987 [24] . Briefly, the method is as follows. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 4 Mguanidinium isothiocyanate. The lysates were then acidified by adding 80 µl of 3 M sodium acetate at pH 4.0. Subsequently, 0.5 ml of water saturated phenol and 0.1 ml chloroform were added to the cellular lysate followed by shaking at 4°C for 20 min. Lysates were spun in the cold for 15 min and the supernatants were collected and extracted again with phenol-chloroform. The supernatants were finally extracted with chloroform and the aqueous layer was collected. RNA was precipitated with absolute ethanol [25] . The precipitate was further centrifuged and the pellet was air-dried. The RNA pellet was then dissolved in 100 µl diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. Concentration of RNA was determined at 260/280 nm optical absorbance. Aliquots (2 µg) of total RNA were annealed with 250 ng of oligo dT primer by heating at 75°C for 10 min followed by its slow cooling to 37°C. Reverse transcription was carried out using 5 units of Avian Myeloma Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase and 20 units of RNA guard following the conditions described [26] . Reverse transcription reaction was carried out in 50 µl total volume and an aliquot of 5-10 µl from this cDNA was amplified for 35 cycles using the following PCR amplification parameters: denaturation 94°C × 30 sec, annealing 50°C × 30 sec and extension 74°C × 60 sec. The MgCl 2 was used at a concentration of 1.5 mmol/L. The PCR amplification reaction was carried out in presence of 50 pmol each of upstream (5′-GGA ACC ATT CTC ACT GTG TG-3′) and down stream (5′-CTC TTC AAA AAC TTC TCC ACA A-3′) IL-8 specific primers using 1 unit of Amplitaq enzyme in a thermocycler. These primers were synthesized based on human IL-8 cDNA sequence information [27] . PCR products were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoretically [28] , stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a gel documentation system (Stratagene). All experiments were carried out under RNase free conditions and the solutions and glassware were made RNase free with DEPC treatment and or by autoclaving. Heat sensitive solutions were made in DEPC treated and autoclaved water followed by their filtration through 0.45 µ size Millipore filters. The concentrations of IL-8 in plasma and BAL fluid supernatants were assayed in duplicate, using a quantitative immunometric, 'sandwich' enzyme immunoassay technique with a detection limit of 4.7 pg/ml (Amersham, UK). Level of myeloperoxidase activity was estimated in the cells collected from 1 ml of BAL from the infected and non-infected lung. The method was essentially the same as described earlier [29] . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C and were homogenized in 1 ml of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer, containing 14 mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and 50 mM KPO4, pH 6.0. Samples were homogenized with polytron for 1 min and were kept cold on ice. The lysates were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed once. The lysates were then centrifuged for 2 min in cold at 14,000 rpm and the supernatants were used to estimate the level of MPO activity. Aliquots of 20 µl supernatant were mixed with 980 µl of odianisidine HCl (sigma) solution containing 16.5 mg of odianisidine HCl, 90 ml of distilled water, 10 ml of KPO4 buffer, pH 6.0, and 50 µl of 1% H 2 O 2 . Absorbance was recorded at 415 nm, every 15 sec for 1 min using Beckman DU700 spectrophotometer. The enzyme activity was calculated (units/min/ml) by dividing the rate of the change in the absorbance by the extinction coefficient, 1.13 × 10 -2 . Enzyme unit is defined as the conversion of 1 µmol of H 2 O 2 per min per ml of alveolar lavage at room temperature. Under these conditions, the residual activity in the pellet was < 10%. Commutations were performed using the Statview 4.02 statistical package with Macintosh Centris 650 computer. Results are expressed as means ± S.E.M. The differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t-test. The differences between the groups were considered significant if p < 0.05. In equal amounts of total cellular RNA, there was a significantly higher level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung (p < 0.001; Fig. 1 , lane 2). Before estimating the changes in the level of IL-8 mRNA, we characterized the identity of IL-8 PCR fragment (272 bp). For this purpose we employed HindIII restriction enzyme. This enzyme cut the IL-8 PCR fragment (272 bp) of free and complex IL-8 in the blood as well as the bronchial mucosa [32] , suggesting that free IL-8 may have a role in the activation of eosinophils. Various other convincing studies suggest that IL-8 is an eosinophil and neutrophil chemoattractant [33] [34] [35] [36] . It has been shown that IL-8 plays a major role in adult respiratory syndrome (ARDS) [37] [38] [39] . On the other hand, certain studies could not find a correlation between the percentage of PMNs and the concentration of IL-8 in BAL fluid of patients with ARDS [21] , suggesting that in addition to IL-8 there may be other chemoattractant agents that are involved in transendothelial migration of PMNs. Several investigators have demonstrated that BAL fluids obtained from patients with pulmonary infection, contain potent chemotactic factors, such as the complement peptide C5a and leukotriene-B4 (LTB4) [40] . In guinea pigs, exogenous IL-8 administration has been shown to recruit neutrophils in the airway lumen [41] . In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that IL-8 induces the release of T-lymphocyte chemoattractants from neutrophil [35] . In vivo studies in mice with a targeted deletion of IL-8 receptor homologue has shown that the total number of recruited cells to the airway lumen following a single antigen challenge was significantly low as compared to the wild type [42] . In consistent with the above studies, in the present study, high concentrations of IL-8 were found in BAL fluids taken from the infected lung of patients with bacterial pneumonia. These results are in agreement with other investigators [21, 43] , who reported high levels of IL-8 in BAL fluids of patients with different lung diseases. Since alveolar macrophages are the major source of IL-8 in the lung, the local production of IL-8 by these cells may be responsible for the recruitment of PMNs into the pulmonary interstitial or air space in a variety of lung diseases. Further studies are required to determine the relationship between the severity of The concentrations of IL-8 in BAL fluids taken from patients with bacterial pneumonia were always high as compared to control group (p < 0.0001; Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, in all patients the levels of IL-8 in BAL obtained from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those from the non-infected lung 130.6 ± 6 to 194.32 ± 54 pg/ml, n = 36 (p < 0.0001). This pattern of increased expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein was consistent with MPO activity in the lavages. In the cells from the equal amount (1 ml) of alveolar lavages there was 4.5 times more MPO activity (9.0 units/min/ml) in the right lung as compared to the level (2.0 units/min/ml) in the left lung (Fig. 3 ). Recent reports have considered IL-8 as the most potent and major PMN chemoattractant factor in lung diseases [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , including ARDS and pneumonia [21] , cystic fibrosis [30] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, or tuberculosis [31] . Several studies have convincingly shown that IL-8 plays a key role in the pathobiology of asthma [18] [19] [20] . Presence of IL-8 has been demonstrated in the bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) of the patients with asthma [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, in asthmatics, there was an increase in the level lung diseases and the alteration of IL-8 in BAL fluids. Nevertheless, the data presented clearly show that the concentration of IL-8 in BAL fluid from pneumonic patients increased in the infected lung. In the lungs, IL-8 appears to be the primary chemoattractant for neutrophils [43] . In addition to various cell types [44] , IL-8 is also synthesized and released by neutrophils [45] . Thus, neutrophils contribute to the recruitment of additional neutrophils in an autocrine manner, by the synthesis and release of IL-8. Several studies suggest that IL-8 also functions as a chemoattractant for eosinophils [33] [34] [35] [36] . It has been shown that major basic protein (MBP), a 13.9 kD protein located in the crystalloid core of eosinophil secondary granules, stimulates the production of IL-8 through transcriptional and posttranscriptional events [46, 47] . In neutrophils, MBP stimulated IL-8 production occur post-transcriptionally through stabilization of IL-8 mRNA [47] . In a recent study it has been noticed that type specific consequences of lung infection may be due to the type specific differences in the induction of cytokines by various infectious agents [48] . In contrast to type 5 adenovirus, type 7 adenovirus stimulated the production of IL-8 in human lung alveolar epithelial cell line (A549 cells) and primary human fetal lung fibroblasts (GM5387 cells). The regulation of IL-8 production, in these cells, occurred at the transcriptional level and at the level of message stability [48] . While adenovirus type 7 increased endogenous IL-8 specific mRNA, both serotypes (type 7 and type 5) enhanced stabilization of IL-8 mRNA [48] . The data presented in our study shows that there was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). The mechanism of IL-8 specific mRNA increase (transcriptional or post-transcriptional) in this study need to be elucidated. The techniques that are commonly used to quantitate inflammatory cells during the development of various diseases in the lungs include histological analysis and ex vivo radiolabeling of leucocytes and quantification of their accumulation in the lungs by counting. These techniques, however, are labor and time intensive and have practical limitations [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . To overcome the limitations of histological and radiolabeling studies, in the present study, we have measured the myeline peroxidase (MPO) activity, in order to quantify the neutrophil accumulation. The pattern of MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung) was consistent with the level of IL-8 mRNA and protein. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate a site-specific involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",

Various other convincing studies suggest that IL-8 is an eosinophil and neutrophil chemoattractant [33] [34] [35] [36] . It has been shown that IL-8 plays a major role in adult respiratory syndrome (ARDS) [37] [38] [39] . On the other hand, certain studies could not find a correlation between the percentage of PMNs and the concentration of IL-8 in BAL fluid of patients with ARDS [21] , suggesting that in addition to IL-8 there may be other chemoattractant agents that are involved in transendothelial migration of PMNs. Several investigators have demonstrated that BAL fluids obtained from patients with pulmonary infection, contain potent chemotactic factors, such as the complement peptide C5a and leukotriene-B4 (LTB4) [40] . In guinea pigs, exogenous IL-8 administration has been shown to recruit neutrophils in the airway lumen [41] . In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that IL-8 induces the release of T-lymphocyte chemoattractants from neutrophil [35] . In vivo studies in mice with a targeted deletion of IL-8 receptor homologue has shown that the total number of recruited cells to the airway lumen following a single antigen challenge was significantly low as compared to the wild type [42] . In consistent with the above studies, in the present study, high concentrations of IL-8 were found in BAL fluids taken from the infected lung of patients with bacterial pneumonia. These results are in agreement with other investigators [21, 43] , who reported high levels of IL-8 in BAL fluids of patients with different lung diseases. Since alveolar macrophages are the major source of IL-8 in the lung, the local production of IL-8 by these cells may be responsible for the recruitment of PMNs into the pulmonary interstitial or air space in a variety of lung diseases. Further studies are required to determine the relationship between the severity of The concentrations of IL-8 in BAL fluids taken from patients with bacterial pneumonia were always high as compared to control group (p < 0.0001; Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, in all patients the levels of IL-8 in BAL obtained from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those from the non-infected lung 130.6 ± 6 to 194.32 ± 54 pg/ml, n = 36 (p < 0.0001). This pattern of increased expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein was consistent with MPO activity in the lavages. In the cells from the equal amount (1 ml) of alveolar lavages there was 4.5 times more MPO activity (9.0 units/min/ml) in the right lung as compared to the level (2.0 units/min/ml) in the left lung (Fig. 3 ). Recent reports have considered IL-8 as the most potent and major PMN chemoattractant factor in lung diseases [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , including ARDS and pneumonia [21] , cystic fibrosis [30] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, or tuberculosis [31] . Several studies have convincingly shown that IL-8 plays a key role in the pathobiology of asthma [18] [19] [20] . Presence of IL-8 has been demonstrated in the bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) of the patients with asthma [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, in asthmatics, there was an increase in the level lung diseases and the alteration of IL-8 in BAL fluids. Nevertheless, the data presented clearly show that the concentration of IL-8 in BAL fluid from pneumonic patients increased in the infected lung. In the lungs, IL-8 appears to be the primary chemoattractant for neutrophils [43] . In addition to various cell types [44] , IL-8 is also synthesized and released by neutrophils [45] . Thus, neutrophils contribute to the recruitment of additional neutrophils in an autocrine manner, by the synthesis and release of IL-8. Several studies suggest that IL-8 also functions as a chemoattractant for eosinophils [33] [34] [35] [36] . It has been shown that major basic protein (MBP), a 13.9 kD protein located in the crystalloid core of eosinophil secondary granules, stimulates the production of IL-8 through transcriptional and posttranscriptional events [46, 47] . In neutrophils, MBP stimulated IL-8 production occur post-transcriptionally through stabilization of IL-8 mRNA [47] . In a recent study it has been noticed that type specific consequences of lung infection may be due to the type specific differences in the induction of cytokines by various infectious agents [48] . In contrast to type 5 adenovirus, type 7 adenovirus stimulated the production of IL-8 in human lung alveolar epithelial cell line (A549 cells) and primary human fetal lung fibroblasts (GM5387 cells). The regulation of IL-8 production, in these cells, occurred at the transcriptional level and at the level of message stability [48] . While adenovirus type 7 increased endogenous IL-8 specific mRNA, both serotypes (type 7 and type 5) enhanced stabilization of IL-8 mRNA [48] . The data presented in our study shows that there was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). The mechanism of IL-8 specific mRNA increase (transcriptional or post-transcriptional) in this study need to be elucidated. The techniques that are commonly used to quantitate inflammatory cells during the development of various diseases in the lungs include histological analysis and ex vivo radiolabeling of leucocytes and quantification of their accumulation in the lungs by counting. These techniques, however, are labor and time intensive and have practical limitations [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . To overcome the limitations of histological and radiolabeling studies, in the present study, we have measured the myeline peroxidase (MPO) activity, in order to quantify the neutrophil accumulation. The pattern of MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung) was consistent with the level of IL-8 mRNA and protein. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate a site-specific involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.",

         "PURPOSE: Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pneumonia. The recognition of risk factors for invasive levofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is important for the design of treatment. METHODS: A retrospective review of cases of invasive pneumococcal infections in adults was undertaken. Epidemiologic data, predisposing factors, clinical variables, and outcome were recorded from previously established protocols. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and the Etest method. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination and Quellung reaction. RESULTS: Twenty patients with infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥2 μg/ml] were compared with 102 patients harboring levofloxacin-susceptible strains; 80 % of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were resistant to ≥3 antibiotics but susceptible to penicillin. Most levofloxacin-resistant strains (80 %) belonged to serotype 8. In comparison, only 8 % of levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci belonged to serotype 8. In the multivariate analysis, residence in public shelters [odds ratio (OR) 26.13; p 0.002], previous hospitalization (OR 61.77; p < 0.001), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR 28.14; p = 0.009), and heavy smoking (OR 14.41; p = 0.016) were associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. Mortality caused by levofloxacin-resistant and levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci was 35 and 14 %, respectively. Among HIV-positive individuals infected with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci 44 % died, but only 12.5 % of HIV-positive patients with levofloxacin-susceptible strains died. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of invasive disease caused by levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae. HIV-positive patients seem to be prone to infection caused by multidrug-resistant serotype 8 and have a high mortality rate.",

         "Fluoroquinolones, particularly the newer fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin with increased activity against Gram-positive bacteria, are now recommended for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, mainly when the isolate has reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics [1] . Consequently, fluoroquinolone prescriptions have increased in some countries among adults with chronic heart and lung disease, who are prone to develop respiratory tract infections [2, 3] . A direct correlation between the use of fluoroquinolones and the prevalence of resistance in S. pneumoniae has been described [2] [3] [4] ; however, despite the increased use of fluoroquinolones, the resistance of S. pneumoniae to the newer members of the family is uncommonly found. Reports from Europe, the US, and Canada showed levels of resistance to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin below 2 % [2] [3] [4] . Three major events may have contributed to this low level of resistance: the replacement of the old fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin by the more active levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and, probably, the fact that fluoroquinolones are rarely used in children [5] . Levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae is basically related to the wide spread of pneumococcal clones, increasing the potential for the rapid dissemination of quinolone resistance in this species [6] . The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors associated to levofloxacin resistance in S. pneumoniae strains causing invasive disease. Such knowledge may assist the clinician who must design empiric treatment in patients with pneumonia and other invasive pneumococcal infections. A retrospective review of cases of invasive pneumococcal infections in adult patients seen from January 2007 to April 2011 in a university-affiliated hospital in downtown Madrid, serving a population of 350,000 inhabitants, was carried out. The clinical charts and microbiological records of all patients with invasive pneumococcal infection (bacteremic pneumonia, meningitis, and pericarditis) were assessed. Epidemiologic data, predisposing factors, clinical variables, and outcomes were recorded from previously established protocols. Isolates from blood, cerebrospinal, and pericardial fluid were identified by Gram staining, colony morphology, bile solubility, susceptibility to optochin, and agglutination with specific sera (Directigen S. pneumoniae, Becton-Dickinson). The antimicrobial susceptibility to levofloxacin was determined by disk diffusion using a disk containing 5 lg of levofloxacin and the Etest method (AB bioMérieux, Solna, Sweden). In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, rifampin, and chloramphenicol were also determined. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination (Pneumotest-Latex kit, Staten Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Quellung reaction with factor antisera (Staten Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark). The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints [7] were considered in order to categorize levofloxacin-susceptible (MIC B2 lg/ml) and levofloxacin-resistant strains (MIC C2 lg/ml). We considered that infection was the main cause of death when the patient died within 14 days of admission due to sepsis and septic shock, respiratory distress, or brain damage in patients with meningitis. Statistics SPSS 16.0 was used for the statistical analysis of the data. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard difference. Discrete variables were expressed as percentages. Associations between qualitative variables were tested using Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test when the sample size was small. The strength of association was measured by odds ratios (ORs) or Haldane's estimator for small sample 2 9 2 tables and their 95 % confidence interval (CI). Differences between groups were considered to be significant at p \\ 0.05. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. The selection of variables for this multivariate analysis was performed by a forward-conditional method, with significance levels of B0.05 for inclusion and C0.1 for exclusion. Cox-Snell R2 was used to assess the overall model fit. One hundred and twenty-two cases of invasive pneumococcal infections were analyzed. Pneumococci were isolated from blood cultures (115), CSF (6), and pericardial fluid (1). Twenty isolates (17.3 %) from 20 patients were levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae. A trend towards an increasing number of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci isolated over the years was observed, with only two cases in 2007 and nine cases in 2011. Twenty patients with levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae were compared with 102 patients infected with levofloxacin-susceptible S. pneumoniae. No differences were found regarding age or gender distribution. The MIC 90 of levofloxacin for the isolates of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae was [32 lg/ml and 16 isolates (80 %) were resistant to three or more different antibiotics (tetracyclines 16, chloramphenicol 16, and TMP-SMX 16). In addition, 18 (90 %) isolates were resistant to erythromycin. However, these isolates were extremely susceptible to penicillin, with an MIC 90 of 0.032 lg/ml. On the other hand, only 6 % of levofloxacinsusceptible pneumococci were multi-resistant strains. Most levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci (16/80 %) belonged to serotype 8. Among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 75 % of isolates belonged to serotype 8. In comparison, only 8 (8 %) of the levofloxacin-susceptible isolates belonged this serotype (p \\ 0.0001). The most prevalent serotypes found among levofloxacin-susceptible strains were 3 (14 %), 19A (11 %), and 1 (8 %). Table 1 shows the risk factors for invasive infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. Current residence in public shelters, previous hospitalization, fluoroquinolone treatment, immunosuppression, HIV infection, chronic viral hepatitis, drug abuse, heavy alcohol intake ([60 g alcohol/day), smoking (C1 packet/day), and chronic obstructive lung disease were risk factors for levofloxacinresistant S. pneumoniae infection. Two HIV-positive patients with bacteremic pneumonia caused by levofloxacinresistant S. pneumoniae had been previously treated with levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Differences were not found among HIV-positive patients with or without infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant strains regarding the frequency of anti-retroviral therapy or mean viral load. However, the median CD4? T lymphocyte cell count of HIV-positive patients with infections due to levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci was less than that of HIV-positive individuals with levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci (mean 50 ± 32 vs. 195 ± 94 ll/mcl; p 0.04). In the multivariate analysis, residence in public shelters (OR 26.13; p 0.002), previous hospitalization (OR 61.77; p \\ 0.001), HIV infection (OR 28.14; p 0.009), and heavy smoking (OR 14.41; p 0.016) were associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci (Table 2) . Mortality associated with infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant and levofloxacin-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 35 and 14 %, respectively (7 out of 20 vs. 14 out of 102; p 0.092). Among nine HIV-positive individuals with infection due to levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci, 4 (44 %) died. In comparison, only 1 of 8 (12.5 %) HIVpositive patients with infection caused by levofloxacinsusceptible strains died of causes directly associated with pneumococcal infection, such as septic shock, respiratory failure, or meningitis. Generally speaking, patients were empirically treated with combinations of antibiotics including beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones. However, two patients were empirically treated with levofloxacin monotherapy. Although they did not develop severe complications and new sets of blood cultures were negative, spiking fever continued under levofloxacin therapy and did not subside until therapy was changed to a third-generation cephalosporin. Although most pneumococci remain susceptible to levofloxacin and other third-generation fluoroquinolones, the prevalence of first-step fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae seems to be increasing [8, 9] . Many strains of primed pneumococci only exhibit subtle changes in the MICs and pass unnoticed in routine susceptibility testing because of high resistance breakpoints [9, 10] . These strains contain a single gyrA or ParC mutation, which prime the bacteria to acquire additional mutations within the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) conferring high-grade fluoroquinolone resistance [11] . Hence, the potential for further increase in fluoroquinolone resistance among S. pneumoniae is significant. In Spain, high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones has remained stable in the last several years at rates of 1.3-2.2 % for levofloxacin, slightly higher than that reported in other European countries [4, 12] . Most isolates of S. pneumoniae with high-level resistance to levofloxacin contain changes in gyrase (gyrA) and ParC or ParE genes and belong to clones Spain 9v -ST 156 and Sweden 15A -ST63 [4, 12] . In this study, we, as others before, have observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of levofloxacinresistant invasive S. pneumoniae in our country [13, 14] . These isolates are fully susceptible to penicillins but resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin [13] . The high prevalence of serotype 8 resistant to levofloxacin and erythromycin reduces the number of antimicrobial agents that can be used for the empirical treatment of pneumococcal infections. The recognition of risk factors that identify patients with a greater likelihood for infection with multidrug-resistant pneumococci may allow clinicians to choose the most appropriate empirical therapy. Infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae has been previously associated with advanced age, nosocomial acquisition, administration of fluoroquinolones, chronic lung disease, and residence in a nursing home [15, 16] . In this study, we found that the most important risk factors for infection with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were current residence in public shelters, preceding hospitalization, previous treatment with fluoroquinolones, HIV infection and immunosuppression, chronic C virus hepatitis, drug abuse, heavy alcohol intake, smoking, and chronic obstructive lung disease. However, only living in public shelters, previous hospitalization, HIV infection, and heavy smoking were independently associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. The strong association with residence in public shelters may suggest that, in fact, we are dealing with a cluster of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococcal infections. Although no systematical molecular typing was carried out, two serotype 8 strains of the present study, which have been previously typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for an earlier report [14] , showed an identical pulse type. This fact indicates an epidemiological link between the strains. HIV infection has also been previously associated with an increased risk of infection by multidrug-resistant pneumococci [14] . These patients have frequent contacts with the health-care system and when a history of drug abuse is present, they commonly have chronic viral hepatitis and live or stay overnight in public shelters. In addition, some of then are heavy drinkers and smokers. All these risk factors were found in the present study. The emergence of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains has been noted in South Africa among children where fluoroquinolones are used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [17] . A survey of 21,521 invasive pneumococcal isolates from 2000 to 2006 by von Gottberg et al. [17] identified 12 cases of high-level levofloxacin resistance. All were HIV-infected children, nine were on therapy for tuberculosis, and ten isolates belonged to serotype 19F, suggesting clonal spread. It is interesting to note that two of our HIV-infected patients with invasive infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci had been treated with levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These findings suggest that the use of fluoroquinolones to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a risk factor for the endemic and clonal spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae [9] . The development of in vivo resistance to fluoroquinolones during the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia has been observed in a few cases [18, 19] . In some of these patients, levofloxacin therapy failed and they died of septic shock and other infective complications. However, the impact of levofloxacin resistance on outcome in adult patients with invasive pneumococcal infection remains controversial. In a recent study, levofloxacin resistance was associated with increased mortality, along with septic shock, prior use of corticosteroids, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [20] . In our study, associated mortality due to levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae was higher than that related to infection with levofloxacin-susceptible strains, but the data did not reach significance. Interestingly, in HIV-positive patients with infection due to levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci, the associated mortality was also higher than that observed in their partners infected with levofloxacin-susceptible strains. In summary, we observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of invasive disease caused by levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Current residence in public shelters, previous hospitalization, HIV infection, and heavy smoking were risk factors independently associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. HIV-positive patients seem to be prone to infection caused by multidrug-resistant serotype 8. In this specific group of patients, mortality was high.",

In comparison, only 1 of 8 (12.5 %) HIVpositive patients with infection caused by levofloxacinsusceptible strains died of causes directly associated with pneumococcal infection, such as septic shock, respiratory failure, or meningitis. Generally speaking, patients were empirically treated with combinations of antibiotics including beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones. However, two patients were empirically treated with levofloxacin monotherapy. Although they did not develop severe complications and new sets of blood cultures were negative, spiking fever continued under levofloxacin therapy and did not subside until therapy was changed to a third-generation cephalosporin. Although most pneumococci remain susceptible to levofloxacin and other third-generation fluoroquinolones, the prevalence of first-step fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae seems to be increasing [8, 9] . Many strains of primed pneumococci only exhibit subtle changes in the MICs and pass unnoticed in routine susceptibility testing because of high resistance breakpoints [9, 10] . These strains contain a single gyrA or ParC mutation, which prime the bacteria to acquire additional mutations within the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) conferring high-grade fluoroquinolone resistance [11] . Hence, the potential for further increase in fluoroquinolone resistance among S. pneumoniae is significant. In Spain, high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones has remained stable in the last several years at rates of 1.3-2.2 % for levofloxacin, slightly higher than that reported in other European countries [4, 12] . Most isolates of S. pneumoniae with high-level resistance to levofloxacin contain changes in gyrase (gyrA) and ParC or ParE genes and belong to clones Spain 9v -ST 156 and Sweden 15A -ST63 [4, 12] . In this study, we, as others before, have observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of levofloxacinresistant invasive S. pneumoniae in our country [13, 14] . These isolates are fully susceptible to penicillins but resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin [13] . The high prevalence of serotype 8 resistant to levofloxacin and erythromycin reduces the number of antimicrobial agents that can be used for the empirical treatment of pneumococcal infections. The recognition of risk factors that identify patients with a greater likelihood for infection with multidrug-resistant pneumococci may allow clinicians to choose the most appropriate empirical therapy. Infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae has been previously associated with advanced age, nosocomial acquisition, administration of fluoroquinolones, chronic lung disease, and residence in a nursing home [15, 16] . In this study, we found that the most important risk factors for infection with levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were current residence in public shelters, preceding hospitalization, previous treatment with fluoroquinolones, HIV infection and immunosuppression, chronic C virus hepatitis, drug abuse, heavy alcohol intake, smoking, and chronic obstructive lung disease. However, only living in public shelters, previous hospitalization, HIV infection, and heavy smoking were independently associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. The strong association with residence in public shelters may suggest that, in fact, we are dealing with a cluster of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococcal infections. Although no systematical molecular typing was carried out, two serotype 8 strains of the present study, which have been previously typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for an earlier report [14] , showed an identical pulse type. This fact indicates an epidemiological link between the strains. HIV infection has also been previously associated with an increased risk of infection by multidrug-resistant pneumococci [14] . These patients have frequent contacts with the health-care system and when a history of drug abuse is present, they commonly have chronic viral hepatitis and live or stay overnight in public shelters. In addition, some of then are heavy drinkers and smokers. All these risk factors were found in the present study. The emergence of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains has been noted in South Africa among children where fluoroquinolones are used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [17] . A survey of 21,521 invasive pneumococcal isolates from 2000 to 2006 by von Gottberg et al. [17] identified 12 cases of high-level levofloxacin resistance. All were HIV-infected children, nine were on therapy for tuberculosis, and ten isolates belonged to serotype 19F, suggesting clonal spread. It is interesting to note that two of our HIV-infected patients with invasive infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci had been treated with levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These findings suggest that the use of fluoroquinolones to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a risk factor for the endemic and clonal spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae [9] . The development of in vivo resistance to fluoroquinolones during the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia has been observed in a few cases [18, 19] . In some of these patients, levofloxacin therapy failed and they died of septic shock and other infective complications. However, the impact of levofloxacin resistance on outcome in adult patients with invasive pneumococcal infection remains controversial. In a recent study, levofloxacin resistance was associated with increased mortality, along with septic shock, prior use of corticosteroids, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [20] . In our study, associated mortality due to levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae was higher than that related to infection with levofloxacin-susceptible strains, but the data did not reach significance. Interestingly, in HIV-positive patients with infection due to levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci, the associated mortality was also higher than that observed in their partners infected with levofloxacin-susceptible strains. In summary, we observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of invasive disease caused by levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Current residence in public shelters, previous hospitalization, HIV infection, and heavy smoking were risk factors independently associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. HIV-positive patients seem to be prone to infection caused by multidrug-resistant serotype 8. In this specific group of patients, mortality was high.",

         "The development of a new group of drugs (polypeptides) have recently increased the interest of alternative administration to the enteral route because of its proteolytic activity and the catabolism of the “first-pass effect.” Aside from the “needle,” the administration in the respiratory tract via aerosol is the method with the best efficiency. But several problems prohibited its spreading: (1) the accuracy and the reproducibility of the inhaled dose (range ca. 1:4); (2) the small amount of inhaled drug in relation to the dose in the aerosol delivery system (range ca. 1%–10%); (3) the fear of allergic reactions of the respiratory system; (4) the variability of the drug transport into the systemic circulation. New approaches and data raise hopes in reducing the problems: (1) aerosol delivery systems with defined particle spectrum and storage systems; slow vital capacity inhaling maneuver; (2) delivery systems that nebulizes nearly the total amount of drug; (3) all studies with the inhalation application of insulin, heparin, ergotamin, ribavirin, aminoglycosides, and “cigarette smoke” do not reveal any relevant allergic reaction; (4) many studies were performed in the last 10 years on the influence of substances and especially of diseases on the transport of molecules through the respiratory tract.

         ". With the exception of the administration of antibiotics, antiviral agents, and vaccines, the other indications have not been widely used and are therefore uncertain. Some of them are only anecdotal. A similar situation exists with respect to the administration of aerosols for systemic purposes is shown in Table 2 . Only the treatment of headache with ergotamine [14] as a metered-dose inhaler is established (Table 3) . Some work has been done on the aerosol administration of insulin [28, 42, 50] . All these studies have shown rapid transport of insulin into the blood with a half-life of approximately 15-25 min. However, the total amount of insulin deposited in the respiratory tract was unknown in all these studies. The poor reproducibility of the inhaled dose was always the reason for terminating these experiments. We performed a study with inhalation of human insulin in 12 volunteers (five smokers and seven nonsmokers) using a special aerosol administration device (AMMD < 2/xm), which allows the estimation of the intrabronchially deposited dose [28, 42] . The inhalation device was calibrated with 99mTc-DTPAaerosol in each volunteer. The time course of the serum insulin (the endogenous insulin is subtracted) and the plasma glucose is given in Figs. 1 and 2 . The dose of insulin transported into the blood was approximately 30% in the nonsmoking group and approximately 65% in the smoking group. It can be assumed that the missing proportion is either stored in the bronchial cells or disturbed by the proteolytic enzymes in the bronchial tree. Interestingly the serum insulin peaks occurred at a similar time in both groups ( Fig. 1) . This leads to the assumption that the transport across the bronchial mucosa is an active mechanism, not simply diffusion. Bhalla and Crocker have shown this mechanism for albumin and peroxidase [2] . Completely different are the problems encountered with the inhalation of heparin. The inhaled heparin seems to be stored and slowly released from the [3, 31] , because the antithrombotic effect of heparin was seen over more than 24 h. No data are available about the characteristics of low-molecular-weight heparin. Heparin generally seems to be a promising substance, because it has an antithrombotic and preventive effect not only on the postmyocardial survival rate [35] , but also on atherosclerosis [9, 23] . As yet, heparin is the only drug known to be able to reverse sclerosis [43] . Less information exists about the intrabronchial administration of polypeptides and prostaglandins by aerosol. Nasal administration is most common. But in future polypeptide drugs will be of greater interest owing to their short haftlife and primary influence on the biologic cybernetic system. To ameliorate the side effects associated with cessation of smoking, a nicotine aerosol is sometimes used [5, 39] . The aerosol administration of nicotine is superior to oral or transcutaneous administration, because it imitates administration via cigarette smoke. The pulsatile pharmacokinetics of nicotine are primarily responsible for abuse [40] . The two main factors preventing the spread of this route of administration are the unsteadiness in dosimetry and the interdisciplinarity of this problem. The influences on the action of the drug from its generation to transport into the blood are very complex and can be divided into six steps (Fig. 3) : The drug itself must be acceptable for inhalation (pK, solubility, taste [26, 40] . In addition, hygroscopy influences its growth in the water-saturated part of the bronchial tree [10, 29, 30] . For the development of a convenient administration system it would be better if the drug could be micronized [7] . The aerosol generator (or delivery system if the drug is micronized) must produce particles that are small enough to achieve an adequate intrabronchial deposition [4, 8, 18, 27, 32, 44, 46] . On the other hand, the aerosols must be big enough to transport a sufficient amount of substance into the lung (volume diameter3). Furthermore, the particle spectrum from the nebulizer should not be influenced by the inspiratory flow (closed system) [13, 26] .  -Breathing pattern (4,6,13,18,26,32.38.44) DEPOSITION -Anatomy of the respiratory tract -Site -Homogeneity (4,8,11,18,26,32,38.44 ) TRANSPORT into BLOOD -Size of the molecules -Solubility -Diseases (2, 7, 19, 21, 28, 31, 33, 36, 37, 40, 42) BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE Fig. 3 . Flow chart representing the influences on the action of the drug from its generation to transport into the blood and final biological response. alteration of the particles constant, the time between generation and inhalation should not differ remarkably. The humidity of the ambient air is rarely noticed to determine the additional weight loss of the nebulizer solution by evaporation [13, 32] . This itself influences the concentration of the drug in the aerosol generator during nebulization [13, 26, 5 I] . Ultrasonic nebulizers should be used with caution because they can alter complex organic molecules [50, 51] . The inhalation maneuver has a noticeable influence on the amount of aerosol deposited in the bronchial tree [4, 8, 13, 18, 26, 32, 38, 44] . The most reliable maneuver is the slow deep breath (similar to a slow vital capacity maneuver) with a breath-holding time of >5 s. The above-mentioned influences on the aerosol deposition in the respiratory tract are modified by anatomy, especially from the area glottica [4, 8, 11, 18, 26, 38, 41] . The site of deposition varies with the anatomy and the degree of bronchial obstruction. This also influences the exhaled dose and the inhomogeneity of the deposition [8, 26, 41] . The transport of the drug into the blood must be measured separately for each chosen drug. It depends on the size of the molecules [2, 19, 28, 36, 37, 40, 42] , the water/lipid solubility and pK [7, 19, 31, 36, 40] and is increased by cigarette smoking as well as some other diseases (e.g. active sarcoidosis, exogenic allergic alveolitis, ARDS, pneumocystis carinii infection [19, 21, 28, 33, 36, 41] . In summary, the administration of drugs for systemic purposes via aerosol inhalation should be more appreciated. Improved aerosol administration devices now available that allow a more precise aerosol deposition in the bronchial tree raise hope for advances in this form of drug administration.",

         "Background. Respiratory illness continues to exert a burden on hajj pilgrims in Makkah. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of respiratory illness and its associated factors among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013 and to describe its preventive measures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Makkah and Malaysia during the 2013 hajj season. A self-administered proforma on social demographics, previous experience of hajj or umrah, smoking habits, co-morbid illness and practices of preventive measures against respiratory illness were obtained. Results. A total of 468 proforma were analysed. The prevalence of the respiratory illness was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfilled the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI). Most of them (77.8%) had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks duration. Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics but only 2.1% of them had been hospitalized. Most of them acquired the infection after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). Vaccination coverages for influenza virus and pneumococcal disease were quite high, 65.2% and 59.4%, respectively. For other preventive measures practices, only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene, ∼82.9% of pilgrims used surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face masks. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10–0.56) or umrah (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07–0.52) and those who have practiced good hand hygiene (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16–0.79) were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of having respiratory illness. Otherwise, pilgrims who had contact with those with respiratory illness (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.12–6.09) was associated with higher risk. Conclusions. The prevalence of respiratory illness remains high among Malaysian hajj pilgrims despite having some practices of preventive measures. All preventive measures which include hand hygiene, wearing face masks and influenza vaccination must be practiced together as bundle of care to reduce respiratory illness effectively.",

         "The hajj is an Islamic pilgrimage to Makkah. It draws in 3 million Muslims surging from all over the world which accounts for the largest gathering of people globally on an annual basis. The 2013 hajj season began from 13 October to 17 October 2013 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Dhu al-Hijjah). They perform specific rituals and follow a detailed route. The pilgrims perform their first circumambulations by walking seven times anticlockwise around the Kaaba. Then, they are required to walk for a total distance of 2.1 km between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times. On the 13 October, they travel to Mina and spend one night there for prayers and additional rituals. The next day, the pilgrims around the world gather at Arafat. When the sun sets, they leave Arafat and move to Muzdalifah, located between Arafat and Mina. They stay at Mina in crowded tents for at least two nights. For the completion of the umrah pilgrimage, which is called the lesser pilgrimage; it is different as it can be performed throughout the year, the pilgrims are not required to perform the brief stay at Arafat. For 1400 years, the mass gathering during hajj has been associated with the risk of communicable diseases, particularly respiratory infection. 1 Extended stays at hajj sites, physical exhaustion, extreme heat and crowded accommodation encourage disease transmission, especially those deriving from airborne agents. 2 Crowd densities during hajj are about up to seven people per square metre. 3 Respiratory tract infection during hajj continues to exert a burden on pilgrims. The respiratory problems account for 74% of all medical illnesses reported during hajj seasons. 4 Pneumonia being the leading reason for hospital admission in 39% of all patients. 5 A recent study involving Malaysian hajj pilgrims found that 90% of them had at least one respiratory symptom. 6 Respiratory illness is a disease affecting the respiratory system and can be due to infection or non-infection. It is complex to define the syndromes of respiratory illness due to variation in the severity, duration and types of symptoms. 7 The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of the respiratory illness among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013, to describe its preventive measures and to determine the association between sociodemographic, previous experience of hajj/umrah, co-morbidity, smoking habits, vaccination and preventive measures with respiratory illness. Apart from those preventive measures, we also explored the association between good hand hygiene practice and respiratory illness/ILI. This is a cross-sectional study involving all consented Malaysian hajj pilgrims in November, 2013. An expanded definition of respiratory illness was used for this study. Respiratory illness was defined as when the person is having at least one of the respiratory symptoms (non-ILI) or ILI. With references to other studies and some limitations (mainly logistic problems), ILI is defined as the triad of cough, subjective fever and sore throat, those who did not fulfil the criteria of ILI were classified into a non-ILI group. [8] [9] [10] [11] Sample size was calculated based on two proportion formula. The sample size according to potential associated factors, the largest sample size was given 780. After adding a possible non-respondent rate of 10%, the sample size for this study is 858. The sampling frame was consented to the Malaysian hujjaj in 2013 who attended the hajj course at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Kelantan on 23 August and the 24 August 2013, those who transitted at Hajj Building Complex, Malaysia from the 15th of September until the 19 September 2013 and those at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The sample selection was based on convenient sampling due to logistic problems. The researchers did not have access to the name of all pilgrims and they did not know about the approval of hajj visa status until a few weeks before their departure. The inclusion criteria were hajj pilgrims above 18 years old and able to comprehend and fill up proforma. Pilgrims who were very ill and unable to independently respond to the proforma were excluded. Data based on the social demographic, co-morbid illness, smoking habits, symptoms of respiratory illness, history of contact with respiratory ill patients, previous experience of hajj or umrah, the practice of preventive measures, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and supplement intake against respiratory illness were obtained by a self-administered proforma. Good hand hygiene or optimal handwashing practices is defined as handwashing for 20 s at least five times per day by using water with soap or a hand sanitizer. 12, 13 In this study, we define good hand hygiene practice as those who frequently wash their hands using hand sanitizers indicated by Centres for Disease Control (CDC). 14 Those using water only, handkerchiefs or disposable tissues were considered as poor hand hygiene practices. History of contact with respiratory illness sufferers is defined as pilgrims who have direct contact or close contact (being within 6 feet (2 m) or within the room or care area for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. 15 Brief instructions were given to the hajj pilgrims before receiving proforma. The proforma were given to participants in Malaysia before their departure and also at Makkah before departing for a brief stay at Arafat. All the completed proforma were collected after completion of hajj at Makkah and at the local airport upon arrival in Malaysia or via postage. The pilgrims were required to complete the proforma at least 2 weeks after their stay at Arafat. All respiratory symptoms that occurred 2 weeks after arrival in KSA were considered significant. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 22.0) was exercised for data entry and statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied to describe the prevalence, practice of deterrent measures and associated factors. The analysis of association between sociodemographic, previous experience of hajj or umrah, co-morbidity, smoking habits, vaccination and the practice of preventive measures with the respiratory illness were done using simple logistic regression and the variables with P value of <0.25 or variables with clinically significant values will be included further with multiple logistic regression analysis. The risk estimation was carried out using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the P value of <0.05 were significant. Variable interaction and multi-collinearity followed by testing on a model assumption was performed before decisions made on the final model. For the final model, the P value of <0.05 were considered as significant. Ethical approval was obtained from the USM Research and Ethics Committee before this study (Reference number: A total of 1200 proforma were distributed to the pilgrims, however, only 480 responded, only 40%. Out of 480 pilgrims who returned the proforma, 12 were excluded from the analysis as grossly incomplete. Altogether 468 proforma were analysed. The age for Malaysian Hajj pilgrims in this study ranged from 17 to 84 years old with a mean age of 52.52 (SD 10.15). The males (56.2%) dominated the female pilgrims with an obvious male to female ratio of 1.3. More than one-half of the pilgrims had at least one medical illness (60.0%). Many of them had hypertension (26.5%), followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) (15.4%), allergic rhinitis (9.0%), bronchial asthma (5.6%) and others (3.6%). Some of the pilgrims still had smoked (12.2%) and 17.9% of them were obese ( Table 1) . The prevalence of respiratory illness symptoms was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfil the criteria for ILI. Most of them had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks (77.8%). Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics, only 2.1% of them were hospitalized. One-half of them had a history of contact with respiratory illness sufferers (52.2%). They acquired the infection intensely at Arafat (81.2%) ( Table 2) . For the practice of preventive measures, the total number of pilgrims that received influenza vaccinations was 305 (65.2%). From those, 130 (27.8%) pilgrims had been immunized with influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A total of 82.9% of pilgrims wore face mask, i.e. surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face mask. Only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement (Table 3) . Factors associated with respiratory illness among Malaysian pilgrims using simple logistic regression analysis was shown in Table 4 . All the supplements were seemed able to protect them from the illness, however they were not statistically significant (Table 4 ). Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10-0.56) or umrah (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07-0.52) and those with good hand hygiene (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16-0.79) were significantly associated with lower risk of respiratory illness. Otherwise, pilgrims having contact with those with respiratory illness (OR 3.01; 95% CI 1.35-6.68) were associated with higher risk ( Table 5 ). The percentage of ILI was lower (38.9%) in those vaccinated with the influenza vaccine than those unvaccinated (61.1%). However, it was statistically not significant with a P value of 0.15 (Table 6 ). The prevalence of the respiratory illness varied by country of origin and by year based on the studies conducted over the past few years. In our study, the prevalence of respiratory illness symptoms among Malaysian hajj pilgrims for the 2013 season was 93.4%, with a subset of 78.2% fulfilling the criteria for ILI. The respiratory illness prevalence was consistent with French pilgrims during the same year (90.7%). 9 The prevalence for the 2013 African hajj pilgrims was slightly lower (77.6%). 16 The results of our study are in parallel with previous studies, 97.0% and 90.0% for the 2009 Saudi Arabia hajj pilgrims and the 2007 Malaysian hajj pilgrims, respectively. 6, 17 In contradiction, the percentage was lower for the US pilgrims in 2009 who suffered from respiratory illness symptoms (41.3%). 18 Crowdedness is a major risk factor for the transmission of respiratory illness. All compulsory rituals of hajj involve crowded places, jam-packed with pilgrims. These conditions contributed to almost one-half of the pilgrims (52.2%) having contact with people suffering from respiratory illness during hajj. They were at a significantly high risk of developing the respiratory illness by three times higher than those who do not have the contact (P value 0.01). Practising contact avoidance during hajj is imperative as it can shorten the duration of respiratory illness. 18 Practicing social distancing and contact avoidance is effective in reducing the transmission of the respiratory symptoms during the 2009 US pilgrims and ILI symptoms in 2014 with the Indian pilgrims. 18, 19 The majority of the respondents was inflicted with respiratory illness after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). It may be correlated with the incubation period of the illness and the peak exposure of pilgrims whilst performing the hajj rituals. Other studies estimated approximately one in three pilgrims will experience respiratory symptoms which usually occurred at the end or shortly after performing hajj rituals. 20 Influenza vaccination is one of the recommended vaccines for high risk pilgrims to reduce mortality and morbidity. The vaccine uptake for influenza in our study is lower (65.2%) in contrast to Malaysian pilgrims in 2007 (72.8%) and Saudi Arabian pilgrims in 2009 (94.4%). 6, 17 The percentage of vaccine uptake among the 2013 hajj pilgrims from other countries were as low as 31.8% for French pilgrims and 31.0% for pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Australia. 21, 22 Effective influenza vaccine remains debatable and cannot be proven if the study was conducted without virology confirmation. Multiple factors such as mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains, inappropriate storage and the handling of the vaccine can reduce its effectiveness or waning of immunity in the population. One study systematically reviewed the available studies assessing the uptake and effectiveness of the influenza vaccine among pilgrims. The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine varied across studies, but was effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza with a P value of <0.001. 23 In our study, the prevalence of ILI was not significantly associated with the status of the vaccination which was similar with pilgrims in Malaysia (2007), France (2006) and Iran (2006). 6, 24, 25 The vaccine was not associated with the reduction and number of acute respiratory symptoms nor any relation to the length of stay for Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2007. 26 The findings were not in accordance with the French pilgrims in 2013 in which the ILI symptoms were less frequently reported in the vaccinated group (34.1%) than unvaccinated group (61.5%) and was statistically significant (P value 0.009). 21 In another study, they found that the influenza vaccine appeared to provide some protection in 'at risk' hajj pilgrims but not in the 'not at risk' group. 10 The influenza vaccines prevented clinic visits for ILI among Malaysian pilgrims in 2000 and Pakistani pilgrims in 1999. 11, 27 The influenza vaccination is a protective factor for ILI more than for non-ILI, giving 70-77% protection for ILI and just 20% protection against the non-ILI group. 11 One hundred and forty-nine of our respondents adopted good hand hygiene during hajj (31.8%). The results were similar to the French pilgrims in 2012 (46.3%) and the US hujjaj in 2009 (45.5%). 18, 28 However, the adherence of French pilgrims towards hand sanitizer practices in 2009 was higher (77.4%) than in the 2012 hajj season. 29 Effective hand hygiene practice in this study could significantly decrease the risk of respiratory illness by 60% than pilgrims who practiced poor hand hygiene. It was parallel with the US pilgrims in 2009 and the French pilgrims in 2012, as regularly washing hands and the use of hand sanitizers significantly causes less of the ILI symptoms. 18, 28 A systematic review on hand-hygiene interventions, including education and the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers towards respiratory illness indicated that some of the interventions were not efficacious against respiratory illnesses. 30 The consistent application of hand hygiene during critical points in the chain of transmission is likely to play a major role in shaping the relative effectiveness of hand-hygiene interventions in terms of disease outcome. Face masks are able to limit the spread of microorganisms, mainly from the respiratory droplets. However, the CDC in USA found that the intermittent use of surgical-type masks was associated with more than a 2.5-fold greater risk of infection. Disposable face masks should be used once and replaced when they become moist and are to be disposed of properly. Most of the Malaysian pilgrims admitted to wearing face masks during hajj (82.9%). This finding was in accordance with other studies, 72.9% for Malaysian pilgrims in 2007 and 79.6% for French pilgrims in 2009. 8, 29 The percentage was higher if compared with other countries in the 2009 hajj season; Saudi Arabia (56%) and USA (42%). 17, 18 It has been revealed that face masks either offered no significant protection or were associated with a longer duration of sore throat and fever symptoms among hajj pilgrims. 25, 29, 31 A recent study illustrated that many pilgrims at the 2009 hajj may not have worn masks correctly (e.g. mistakenly positioning the top of the mask below the nose). 32 A recent review by Benkouiten et al. 33 in 2014 also mentioned that the effectiveness of the face mask in the prevention of the respiratory symptoms among hajj pilgrims revealed variable results. Regular use of a face mask was the most essential practical protective factor in respiratory illness, using it for more than 8 h led to a substantial decrease in the incidence of ILI among Australian pilgrims in 2011. 34, 35 These masks were potentially effective at preventing respiratory virus acquisition by household contacts of infected people when worn by healthy people. However, the effectiveness depended largely on adherence to mask use. 36 Honey is one of the most promising natural substances that can combat or prevent respiratory illness. 37 Approximately 22.9% of pilgrims consumed honey during hajj. However, there was no other study to compare the prevalence of honey intake among hajj pilgrims except for one study to determine the effectiveness of honey in reducing respiratory symptoms. 38 During the hajj, pilgrims undergo great physical and emotional strain. The experienced hajj veterans or even umrah is an advantage as it can help them to be more physically prepared as well as mentally and spiritually ready. However, every year is different and every person's experience is individually specific but they are able to prepare themselves as much as possible for the hajj challenges. The association of previous experiences during hajj or umrah with respiratory illness has not been studied before. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj or umrah were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of developing respiratory illness (P value of 0.001 for both). Further study needs to be conducted to explore the factors that contribute to the association of respiratory illness in those who have experienced performing hajj or umrah. The limitations of this study include inadequate sample size and a poor response rate as it could affect the power of the study. The small response rate could be due to a lack of commitment from the respondents following a very packed hajj ritual schedule. Shortage of staff to handle and follow-up the respondents in Makkah, further added to the problem. In conclusion, the prevalence of respiratory illness remains high among Malaysian hajj pilgrims despite having some practicing preventive measures. Practicing only certain preventive measures are inadequate. All preventive measures including hand hygiene, wearing face masks and influenza vaccination must be practiced together to reduce the respiratory illness effectively. In our study, good hand hygiene practice was lower compared with other preventive measures; therefore, health authorities should find a way to overcome this problem. Further studies are required to develop a health education module to promote a comprehensive preventive measure for hajj pilgrims. ",
         "The prevalence and preventive measures of the respiratory illness among Malaysian pilgrims in 2013 hajj season. Background. Respiratory illness continues to exert a burden on hajj pilgrims in Makkah. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of respiratory illness and its associated factors among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013 and to describe its preventive measures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Makkah and Malaysia during the 2013 hajj season. A self-administered proforma on social demographics, previous experience of hajj or umrah, smoking habits, co-morbid illness and practices of preventive measures against respiratory illness were obtained. Results. A total of 468 proforma were analysed. The prevalence of the respiratory illness was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfilled the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI). Most of them (77.8%) had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks duration. Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics but only 2.1% of them had been hospitalized. Most of them acquired the infection after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). Vaccination coverages for influenza virus and pneumococcal disease were quite high, 65.2% and 59.4%, respectively. For other preventive measures practices, only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene, ∼82.9% of pilgrims used surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face masks. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10–0.56) or umrah (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07–0.52) and those who have practiced good hand hygiene (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16–0.79) were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of having respiratory illness. Otherwise, pilgrims who had contact with those with respiratory illness (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.12–6.09) was associated with higher risk. Conclusions. The prevalence of respiratory illness remains high among Malaysian hajj pilgrims despite having some practices of preventive measures. All preventive measures which include hand hygiene, wearing face masks and influenza vaccination must be practiced together as bundle of care to reduce respiratory illness effectively.. The hajj is an Islamic pilgrimage to Makkah. It draws in 3 million Muslims surging from all over the world which accounts for the largest gathering of people globally on an annual basis. The 2013 hajj season began from 13 October to 17 October 2013 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Dhu al-Hijjah). They perform specific rituals and follow a detailed route. The pilgrims perform their first circumambulations by walking seven times anticlockwise around the Kaaba. Then, they are required to walk for a total distance of 2.1 km between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times. On the 13 October, they travel to Mina and spend one night there for prayers and additional rituals. The next day, the pilgrims around the world gather at Arafat. When the sun sets, they leave Arafat and move to Muzdalifah, located between Arafat and Mina. They stay at Mina in crowded tents for at least two nights. For the completion of the umrah pilgrimage, which is called the lesser pilgrimage; it is different as it can be performed throughout the year, the pilgrims are not required to perform the brief stay at Arafat. For 1400 years, the mass gathering during hajj has been associated with the risk of communicable diseases, particularly respiratory infection. 1 Extended stays at hajj sites, physical exhaustion, extreme heat and crowded accommodation encourage disease transmission, especially those deriving from airborne agents. 2 Crowd densities during hajj are about up to seven people per square metre. 3 Respiratory tract infection during hajj continues to exert a burden on pilgrims. The respiratory problems account for 74% of all medical illnesses reported during hajj seasons. 4 Pneumonia being the leading reason for hospital admission in 39% of all patients. 5 A recent study involving Malaysian hajj pilgrims found that 90% of them had at least one respiratory symptom. 6 Respiratory illness is a disease affecting the respiratory system and can be due to infection or non-infection. It is complex to define the syndromes of respiratory illness due to variation in the severity, duration and types of symptoms. 7 The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of the respiratory illness among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013, to describe its preventive measures and to determine the association between sociodemographic, previous experience of hajj/umrah, co-morbidity, smoking habits, vaccination and preventive measures with respiratory illness. Apart from those preventive measures, we also explored the association between good hand hygiene practice and respiratory illness/ILI. This is a cross-sectional study involving all consented Malaysian hajj pilgrims in November, 2013. An expanded definition of respiratory illness was used for this study. Respiratory illness was defined as when the person is having at least one of the respiratory symptoms (non-ILI) or ILI. With references to other studies and some limitations (mainly logistic problems), ILI is defined as the triad of cough, subjective fever and sore throat, those who did not fulfil the criteria of ILI were classified into a non-ILI group. [8] [9] [10] [11] Sample size was calculated based on two proportion formula. The sample size according to potential associated factors, the largest sample size was given 780. After adding a possible non-respondent rate of 10%, the sample size for this study is 858. The sampling frame was consented to the Malaysian hujjaj in 2013 who attended the hajj course at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Kelantan on 23 August and the 24 August 2013, those who transitted at Hajj Building Complex, Malaysia from the 15th of September until the 19 September 2013 and those at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The sample selection was based on convenient sampling due to logistic problems. The researchers did not have access to the name of all pilgrims and they did not know about the approval of hajj visa status until a few weeks before their departure. The inclusion criteria were hajj pilgrims above 18 years old and able to comprehend and fill up proforma. Pilgrims who were very ill and unable to independently respond to the proforma were excluded. Data based on the social demographic, co-morbid illness, smoking habits, symptoms of respiratory illness, history of contact with respiratory ill patients, previous experience of hajj or umrah, the practice of preventive measures, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and supplement intake against respiratory illness were obtained by a self-administered proforma. Good hand hygiene or optimal handwashing practices is defined as handwashing for 20 s at least five times per day by using water with soap or a hand sanitizer. 12, 13 In this study, we define good hand hygiene practice as those who frequently wash their hands using hand sanitizers indicated by Centres for Disease Control (CDC). 14 Those using water only, handkerchiefs or disposable tissues were considered as poor hand hygiene practices. History of contact with respiratory illness sufferers is defined as pilgrims who have direct contact or close contact (being within 6 feet (2 m) or within the room or care area for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. 15 Brief instructions were given to the hajj pilgrims before receiving proforma. The proforma were given to participants in Malaysia before their departure and also at Makkah before departing for a brief stay at Arafat. All the completed proforma were collected after completion of hajj at Makkah and at the local airport upon arrival in Malaysia or via postage. The pilgrims were required to complete the proforma at least 2 weeks after their stay at Arafat. All respiratory symptoms that occurred 2 weeks after arrival in KSA were considered significant. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 22.0) was exercised for data entry and statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied to describe the prevalence, practice of deterrent measures and associated factors. The analysis of association between sociodemographic, previous experience of hajj or umrah, co-morbidity, smoking habits, vaccination and the practice of preventive measures with the respiratory illness were done using simple logistic regression and the variables with P value of <0.25 or variables with clinically significant values will be included further with multiple logistic regression analysis. The risk estimation was carried out using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the P value of <0.05 were significant. Variable interaction and multi-collinearity followed by testing on a model assumption was performed before decisions made on the final model. For the final model, the P value of <0.05 were considered as significant. Ethical approval was obtained from the USM Research and Ethics Committee before this study (Reference number: A total of 1200 proforma were distributed to the pilgrims, however, only 480 responded, only 40%. Out of 480 pilgrims who returned the proforma, 12 were excluded from the analysis as grossly incomplete. Altogether 468 proforma were analysed. The age for Malaysian Hajj pilgrims in this study ranged from 17 to 84 years old with a mean age of 52.52 (SD 10.15). The males (56.2%) dominated the female pilgrims with an obvious male to female ratio of 1.3. More than one-half of the pilgrims had at least one medical illness (60.0%). Many of them had hypertension (26.5%), followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) (15.4%), allergic rhinitis (9.0%), bronchial asthma (5.6%) and others (3.6%). Some of the pilgrims still had smoked (12.2%) and 17.9% of them were obese ( Table 1) . The prevalence of respiratory illness symptoms was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfil the criteria for ILI. Most of them had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks (77.8%). Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics, only 2.1% of them were hospitalized. One-half of them had a history of contact with respiratory illness sufferers (52.2%). They acquired the infection intensely at Arafat (81.2%) ( Table 2) . For the practice of preventive measures, the total number of pilgrims that received influenza vaccinations was 305 (65.2%). From those, 130 (27.8%) pilgrims had been immunized with influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A total of 82.9% of pilgrims wore face mask, i.e. surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face mask. Only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement (Table 3) . Factors associated with respiratory illness among Malaysian pilgrims using simple logistic regression analysis was shown in Table 4 . All the supplements were seemed able to protect them from the illness, however they were not statistically significant (Table 4 ). Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10-0.56) or umrah (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07-0.52) and those with good hand hygiene (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16-0.79) were significantly associated with lower risk of respiratory illness. Otherwise, pilgrims having contact with those with respiratory illness (OR 3.01; 95% CI 1.35-6.68) were associated with higher risk ( Table 5 ). The percentage of ILI was lower (38.9%) in those vaccinated with the influenza vaccine than those unvaccinated (61.1%). However, it was statistically not significant with a P value of 0.15 (Table 6 ). The prevalence of the respiratory illness varied by country of origin and by year based on the studies conducted over the past few years. In our study, the prevalence of respiratory illness symptoms among Malaysian hajj pilgrims for the 2013 season was 93.4%, with a subset of 78.2% fulfilling the criteria for ILI.

It may be correlated with the incubation period of the illness and the peak exposure of pilgrims whilst performing the hajj rituals. Other studies estimated approximately one in three pilgrims will experience respiratory symptoms which usually occurred at the end or shortly after performing hajj rituals. 20 Influenza vaccination is one of the recommended vaccines for high risk pilgrims to reduce mortality and morbidity. The vaccine uptake for influenza in our study is lower (65.2%) in contrast to Malaysian pilgrims in 2007 (72.8%) and Saudi Arabian pilgrims in 2009 (94.4%). 6, 17 The percentage of vaccine uptake among the 2013 hajj pilgrims from other countries were as low as 31.8% for French pilgrims and 31.0% for pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Australia. 21, 22 Effective influenza vaccine remains debatable and cannot be proven if the study was conducted without virology confirmation. Multiple factors such as mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains, inappropriate storage and the handling of the vaccine can reduce its effectiveness or waning of immunity in the population. One study systematically reviewed the available studies assessing the uptake and effectiveness of the influenza vaccine among pilgrims.

The results were similar to the French pilgrims in 2012 (46.3%) and the US hujjaj in 2009 (45.5%). 18, 28 However, the adherence of French pilgrims towards hand sanitizer practices in 2009 was higher (77.4%) than in the 2012 hajj season. 29 Effective hand hygiene practice in this study could significantly decrease the risk of respiratory illness by 60% than pilgrims who practiced poor hand hygiene. It was parallel with the US pilgrims in 2009 and the French pilgrims in 2012, as regularly washing hands and the use of hand sanitizers significantly causes less of the ILI symptoms. 18, 28 A systematic review on hand-hygiene interventions, including education and the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers towards respiratory illness indicated that some of the interventions were not efficacious against respiratory illnesses. 30 The consistent application of hand hygiene during critical points in the chain of transmission is likely to play a major role in shaping the relative effectiveness of hand-hygiene interventions in terms of disease outcome. Face masks are able to limit the spread of microorganisms, mainly from the respiratory droplets. However, the CDC in USA found that the intermittent use of surgical-type masks was associated with more than a 2.5-fold greater risk of infection.

The association of previous experiences during hajj or umrah with respiratory illness has not been studied before. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj or umrah were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of developing respiratory illness (P value of 0.001 for both). Further study needs to be conducted to explore the factors that contribute to the association of respiratory illness in those who have experienced performing hajj or umrah. The limitations of this study include inadequate sample size and a poor response rate as it could affect the power of the study.

         "Respiratory symptoms questionnaires and pulmonary function tests are basic tools in the epidemiology of non-specific respiratory diseases. 1 The association between the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function impairment is a classical notion. 2 In contrast, the effect of the presence of acute respiratory symptoms on lung function measurements is less well documented, as acute symptoms are not recorded by the standard respiratory symptoms questionnaires. A 'common cold' causing cough on the day of the examination was recently reported to induce a significant decrease in one second forced expiratory volume in a group of otherwise healthy Paris workers by Neukirch et a/. 3 We report the effect of acute respiratory symptoms or signs on pulmonary function in a group of children and adolescents in Lorraine, France. The French Social Security system offers its affiliates a free medical check-up every five years in a network of Centres of Preventive Medicine spread over the country. The Vandoeuvre-Nancy Centre, in oper- ation since 1969, covers about three million inhabitants. Following a geographical rotating system, a letter is addressed to each family explaining the importance of a complete medical check-up for the detection of inapparent diseases in their early phase. For those accepting the offer, an appointment is arranged and questionnaires on health status are mailed for self-completion. The families (including children over four years old and adults up to 60 years) attend the Centre twice. At the first visit (lasting half a day) further questionnaires are completed with the aid of an interviewer, anthropometric measurements are obtained, clinical physiology (auditive, ocular, cardiovascular, respiratory) measurements are made and venous blood is drawn for laboratory tests. At a second visit, two weeks later, the families meet a Centre physician for a physical examination, comments on the biological tests and a general conclusion about their health status. In order to study the determinants of pulmonary function in children and adolescents in north-eastern France, parents were offered supplementary-pulmonary function testing for children* in the 10 to 16 year age range between May and November 1983. This sixmonth period was deliberately chosen as the invited population came from a region with no atmospheric • Pulmonary function wai not included in the routine battery of test! for this age group. pollution. We selected children in this age range since they were old enough to cooperate in a complex respiratory manoeuvre, but unlikely to have become active smokers. The names of the children were taken sequentially from the Centre of Preventive Medicine computer list with a limit of 10 children per half day; between 5 and 20 children were examined daily. The purpose of the study was briefly explained to the parents and to the children in order to obtain informed consent and optimal cooperation. The study protocol was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Medical \"Research of the University Hospital and Centre for Preventive Medicine. A total of 684 subjects were examined, but the results for the first 149 (seen between 20 May and 11 June 1983) had to be deleted because of repeated technical failure of the spirometric semi-automated module. Thereafter, a computerized spirometer was satisfactorily used. Of the 535 children seen between June and November 1983, 14 were excluded because of incomplete medical history or for various clinical reasons (obesity, epilepsia, neuro-, muscular disorders), leaving 521 children. Fifteen of these were unable to perform the forced expirogram correctly, so that 506 subjects were included in the study. The study protocol consisted of a questionnaire (filled in by interviewing one parent), a forced expiration test and a single-breath nitrogen (SBN 2 ) washout test. We .used the Children's Questionnaire recommended by the American Thoracic Society Epidemiology Standardization Project* which was designed for self-completion by a parent or for personal interview. Although no physical examination was done, at the time pulmonary function testing was performed the child was asked if he had had a 'cold' (running or blocked nose, sore throat, cough) during the last 2-3 days and the presence of respiratory signs (rhinorea, hoarse voice, cough) was noted. The child was further invited to cough and the observer noted the result as 'loose' or 'dry'. 3 The forced vital capacity (FVC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV,), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMF) and the forced expiratory flows (FEF) at 75-50 and 25% (to be expired) FVC were measured with an electronic spirometer (SPIROMATIC, Constructions L. Martin SA). A Fleisch n° 3 pneumotachograph measured the expired flow; the output was electronically linearized to 16 l.s\" 1 ; volume was obtained by integration. The flow and volume signals were fed into a micro-computer (Apple U, Cupertino, California) which stored the results together with the subject identification data and computed the predicted values. The system met the ATS Standards on Spirometry; calibration was done twice daily with a 3 litre syringe. At least three flow-volume curves were obtained; the best values were recorded for FVC, FEV, and PEF, while the FEF were calculated on the curves with the largest sum FVC plus FEV^ The results were expressed in ml BTPS and in % of the predicted values obtained from the equations of Zapletal el al? The SBN 2 test was done using a computerized assembly as previously described. ' The expired volume (Fleisch n° 1 pneumotachograph + integrator) and N 2 concentration measured at the mouth (Hewlett-Packard 47302 A analyser) were fed into a micro-computer (Apple II) which calculated the alveolar (phase m) nitrogen slope (P HI, %Nj.l \"') . the closing volume, expressed in ml BTPS and in % of vital capacity (CV/WC, %), the total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) from the alveolar dilution equation 9 and the closing capacity (CC, sum of CV and RV, expressed in ml and in % of TLC). The pneumotachograph-integrator was calibrated twice a day with a 1-litre syringe. The N 2 analyser had its zero level set with pure oxygen, the upper point of the scale was set on ambient air FN 2 adjusting for temperature and humidity and the linearity was checked with high-precision N 2 +O 2 mixtures. The subject performed at least two trials, preceded by a full inspiration and separated by a three minute pause; the expired vital capacity had to be within 13% of the separately measured FVC 1011 and the expiratory flow was kept below 0.5 l.s-1 . The result reported is the arithmetic mean of 2 or 3 trials. The inspiratory and expiratory valves were driven by the computer program, the respiratory flows and volumes were displayed on a screen so that the technician giving the test could concentrate on coaching and encouraging the child. Despite this, the number of failures was notably larger than for the forced expiration, only 415 children satisfactorily completing the SBNj test. The association between binary data was assessed by the x 2 test. Analysis of variance and the Student't' test were used for comparing means of different groups. 12 The information on respiratory symptoms or signs at the time of the study was not recorded for one child, so that the results for 505 children (240 girls) are presented: 65 children had respiratory symptoms or signs when tested; 7 of them had symptoms (cough with sputum) or signs (loose cough, fever) of lower airways involvement, while in the other 58 the symptoms (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, sneezing, sore throat) were limited to the upper airways, thus corresponding to an abortive or mildly severe 'common cold'. u A preliminary analysis indicated no difference for functional indices (eg FVC103.1 ±6.5 versus 102.1 ± 10.6% predicted for children with lower and upper airway involvement) between the two subgroups and we decided to combine them. Among the 65 children with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) at the time of the study 46 (ie more than two-thirds) were boys; the association between presence of ARI and male sex was significant (x 2 = 10.01, p < 0.01). Age, height and weight (Table 1) did not differ significantly between the two groups in either sex. For the sake of brevity, only results expressed in per cent of predicted values are reported for spirometry and forced flows. Boys with ARI had significantly lower FEV, FEV,, PEF, MMF and FEF»» as compared to those without; no difference was found in girls ( Table 2) . ARI did not influence static lung volumes, distribution of inspired gas or small airways closure, with the exception of a slightly significant increase in the RV/TLC ratio and phase HI N 2 slope in boys (Table 3) . Looking for the influence of age, we separated the children in two subgroups at age 13 (Table 4) ; again, no anthropometric differences were found between children with and without ARI (Table 4) . When the results of ventilatory function variables of boys were analysed by age, although some effect was present in subjects under 13, the differences were larger and statistical significance was reached (for FEV,. O , MMF and MEF) in boys aged 13 to 16 years (Table 5) . MEFjo* was 15.3% lower than predicted in boys with ARI-a difference significant at the 1 % level (Table 5) . A higher proportion of children with chronic respiratory symptoms among the subgroup with ARI could have influenced the results. We therefore excluded the subjects with a history of chronic cough, sputum production or wheeze, and repeated the analysis of pulmonary function. Thirty-nine children had acute symptoms or signs being otherwise asymptomatic; the proportion of boys (27 versus 12 girls) was still significantly increased (x 1 = 7.20, p < 0.007). The ventilatory function was decreased again for children with ARI; the differences between the mean values of functional indices were the same, the lower number of subjects limited the statistical power. Among the SBN 2 variables, only P III was just significantly altered in children with ARI after excluding children with chronic respiratory symptoms (1.19±0.50 versus 1.05±0.39, p < 0.05). Finally, we repeated the analysis after excluding the children who smoked; the results (47 children with ARI versus 301 children without) did not differ from those presented in Tables 2 and 3 . This study indicates significant impairment of pulmonary function in children with symptoms or signs of acute respiratory infection confirming and extending previous findings in children 14 and adults. 3 Standard questionnaires (practically all derived from the original British MRC Questionnaire on Respiratory Symptoms 15 ) are used to define chronic bronchitis, asthma and related conditions.\" Only chronic symptoms are recorded, however, by these questionnaires; in epi- demiological studies on lung function acute respiratory symptoms should not be present at the time of study, although this is rarely specified. Acute respiratory infections in children represent a most important public health problem.\" Practically all are of viral origin; with the exception of adeno-and herpes viruses (containing DNA) all the other viruses causing ARI contain ribonucleic acid (RNA). U ' 18 Although various viruses can elicit ARI of variable severity, the more severe forms of infection are due to influenza, respiratory syncytial and adenoviruses, while milder forms are mostly due to coronavirus, parainfluenza and rhinoviruses. 13 -18 '\" Some authors divide ARI into upper and lower respiratory tract infections; we choose to follow Crofton and Douglas 13 who recognize six clinical pictures (the coryzal, pharyngeal, pharyngoconjunctival, influenza, herpangina, and croup syndromes) and four severity categories (abortive, mild, moderate, and severe colds). The effect of acute respiratory infections on lung function was not the primary objective of our study; in fact, the survey was scheduled for summer and early autumn, with the hope of avoiding the viral epidemics of the cold season. As the first outbreak of infection occurred, we recorded the presence of symptoms in order to exclude these children for the analysis. When a second outbreak appeared we decided to analyse the subgroup with respiratory symptoms or signs as it comprised a considerable number of children. No attempt was made to identify the virus (viruses) responsible for the infection. However, in only 7 of the 65 children studied did the clinical picture correspond to a moderately severe 'common cold'. u Various pulmonary function disturbances have been documented in moderate or severe ARI due to adenovirus, 20 respiratory syncytial or influenza viruses; 21 -22 for the sake of brevity the present discussion will be limited to the effects of less aggressive viruses. Also, we will mainly discuss the results of naturally acquired infections in healthy children or adults; the results of experimental infections, the consequences of vaccinations with live attenuated viruses, and those of ARI in subjects with chronic lung diseases will be only briefly mentioned. Picken et af 3 were the first to report pulmonary function changes during an upper respiratory tract infection. The serial study of 12 healthy subjects suggested the involvement of 'small airways' (frequencydependence of dynamic compliance) 4-8 weeks after the start of the infection, with a return to normal after an additional four weeks. In a follow-up study of 18 healthy adults Cate et aP* recorded pulmonary function during 24 illness episodes caused by eight rhinovirus strains. While no consistent effects on ventilary function were found, these authors noticed a significant decrease in steady-state diffusing capacity-a finding attributed by them to ventilation inhomogeneity due to bronchiolitis. The study by Fridy et aP 5 included 52 subjects, 22 of whom returned for serial studies of pulmonary function during and after a mild viral respiratory illness. A complete battery of pulmonary function tests was used (static lung volumes, closing volume, air-and helium-flow-volume curves); the pulmonary function changes, suggesting peripheral airways obstruction, occurred only in smokers, and persisted for several weeks. Using experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy volunteers, Blair et aP 6 demonstrated the greater sensitivity of frequency-dependence of dynamic compliance which became abnormal when closing volume, maximal expiratory flows, specific conductance were unchanged. For Bush et aP 1 the most sensitive test was the volume of isoflow, and the methacholine response became positive in the three (out of seven) subjects developing lower airways and systemic symptoms. An increase in bronchia] reactivity is in agreement with clinical data 2 * showing that more than half of rhinovirus infection episodes are associated with wheezing in children and adults. Airway hyperreactivity may be the consequence of sensitization of airway epithelial receptors after mucosal cell damage, of a diminished adrenergic response of bronchial smooth muscle, or of histamine release secondary to virus infection. 29 The subject remains controversial, however, as negative results have also been recently reported. XM The only study of pulmonary function in normal children with upper respiratory infections was done in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, by Collier et al. 1 * A total of 55 children aged 2.5 to 11 years were followed for a mean duration of two years, yielding 617 'well' and 237 'illness' observations. Lung function tests comprised spirometry (including forced expiratory flows) and static lung volumes (helium dilution); the observed lung function values were adjusted (by sex) for height and clinical status (normal or upper respiratory illness). Adjusted mean values of FVC, FEV,, PEF, MMF, and FEF»* decreased during upper respiratory illness, the differences between the mean values of the 'illness' and 'well' observations were not significant in children over seven years of age. In younger children, FVC, FEV,, PEF and FEFjo* showed significant difference in girls, while only FVC and PEF did so in boys. TLC and the functional residual capacity did not differ in any sex-age group. In the present study, age, height and weight were not significantly different in children with and without ARI allowing the comparison of absolute values of lung function results. The presence of an ARI was significantly associated with male sex, and pulmonary function was impaired in boys but not in girls. This finding suggests that male gender increases vulnerability for respiratory disease not only in adults, 32 but also in children. Most ventilatory function indices were decreased in boys with ARI. The differences between means ranged from 3-4% for FVC and FEV] to more than 10% for FEFJO* (p < 0.001). We were somewhat surprised to find a non-significant difference for FEF^*, as this index is in principle more sensitive to early airflow limitation. 33 Our results confirmed the lack of sensitivity of this index for detecting abnormality during ARI in children 14 -21 and adults; 3 this is attributable in part to the high coefficient of variation. In the children studied by us the differences in the whole group were exclusively due to impairment of lung function in boys. The sex difference observed was not due to statistical factors (lower inter-subject variability in boys) but to the absence of any effect of 33 A narrowing of airways is expected to have a greater effect on airway resistance or forced flows the smaller the baseline diameter is. Contrary to this prediction, and to the results of Collier et a/, 14 we found the differences in ventilatory function to be significant in older boys (Table 5) . Although we find no obvious explanation for this, it should be stressed that the comparison between this study and that of Collier et al is limited by several important differences. First, their study was a prospective longitudinal one, each child having several measurements done; they were able to statistically validate minimal differences in pulmonary function (eg 50 ml or 50 ml s~'). Second, their children were much younger than those studied by us (2.5 to 11 years old). Third, 66% of their children were black, and racial differences in the reaction to virus infection may exist. In our study, lung volumes and distribution of ventilation were less influenced by ARI, confirming the negative results of Collier et al. 14 There was one exception to this, however. In boys, a slight increase of the RV/TLC ratio accompanied a marginally significant increase of phase HI slope (Table 3) . Although minor, these changes are of interest because the same two variables were altered (borderline statistical significance) in a group of asymptomatic adults with a history of recent acute respiratory infection. 36 - 37 An increase in RV and in P III slope was reported by Coates et a/ 38 after experimental iv infusion of saline in man; this suggests that peripheral airway obstruction (revealed by hyperinflation and altered distribution of ventilation) accompanies minimal increases in interstitial lung fluid. Closing volume and closing capacity proved to be of no value in detecting abnormality, in agreement with a previous report on passive exposure to tobacco smoke. 39 The impairment of pulmonary function variables in children with ARI was not due to the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms, since the results were unchanged (with unavoidable loss of statistical significance) when the analysis was restricted to the 39 children without chronic symptoms (Table 6 ). Tobacco smoking did not interact with the influence of ARI since the exclusion of 18 children who smoked among the symptomatic group had no influence on the results. Atmospheric pollution is known to increase the incidence of respiratory infections in children;* this influ-ence was excluded in the present study as the children came from a non-polluted area. Other factors, which were not controlled in this analysis, are represented by parental respiratory symptoms, 41 parental smoking, 41 -42 socioeconomic and educational level 43 or housing conditions. 44 Can a mild ARI have consequences in the long term? In contrast to the severe infections due to aggressive viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) whose sequels are well known, 43 the reported regression of physiological disturbances over 3 to 6 weeks 13 -23 allows this question to be answered in the negative, at least for healthy subjects. The effect of repeated (even mild) 'insults' of the respiratory tract by 'benign' viruses in children with chronic respiratory disease remains to be assessed. In conclusion, we have found consistent, statistically significant, impairment of ventilatory function in a group of 10-16 year old children with mild acute respiratory infection on the day of the study. Functional disturbances were present among boys, but not girls; they were more important in older children (13 to 16 years). The effect was independent of tobacco consumption and of the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms. Ventilatory defects did not fit the classical obstructive type, since both FEV! and FVC were decreased in equal proportions, the FEVj/FVC ratio being unchanged. Taken as a whole, the tests of 'small airway dysfunction' were less sensitive as compared to spirometry in detecting abnormality due to ARI, with the exception of a borderline increase in the RV/TLC ratio and of phase in N 2 slope in boys. As functional signs of large (eg PFR, FEV!) and small airways (RV/ TLC, PITI) co-exist, it can be concluded that the whole respiratory tract is functionally affected by an ARI. The present results support the proposal of the GAP Conference Committee 44 that paediatric reference standards for lung function tests should be obtained on children with no present acute respiratory symptoms and no history of an upper respiratory tract infection during the preceding weeks.",
         "Respiratory Symptoms or Signs on the Day of the Study Alter Pulmonary Function in Teenagers†. Pulmonary function variables (forced expiratory flows and vital capacity, static lung volume, alveolar N(2) slopes closing volume and closing capacity) were compared in a group of 10–16 year old children with (n=65) and without (n=440) symptoms or signs of mild acute respiratory infection (‘common cold’). Symptomatic children had a significant impairment of forced expiratory vital capacity and flows, with no change In static volumes, alveolar N(2) slopes and closing volumes. The effect was present only In boys (in whom RV/TLC and phase III slope were borderline abnormal), was more evident in older children (13 to 16 years) and was independent of the smoking habits or the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms. The results are in favour of a predominant involvement of upper airways, but signs of lower airways dysfunction are present in boys and in children 13 to 16 years old.. Respiratory symptoms questionnaires and pulmonary function tests are basic tools in the epidemiology of non-specific respiratory diseases. 1 The association between the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function impairment is a classical notion. 2 In contrast, the effect of the presence of acute respiratory symptoms on lung function measurements is less well documented, as acute symptoms are not recorded by the standard respiratory symptoms questionnaires. A 'common cold' causing cough on the day of the examination was recently reported to induce a significant decrease in one second forced expiratory volume in a group of otherwise healthy Paris workers by Neukirch et a/. 3 We report the effect of acute respiratory symptoms or signs on pulmonary function in a group of children and adolescents in Lorraine, France. The French Social Security system offers its affiliates a free medical check-up every five years in a network of Centres of Preventive Medicine spread over the country. The Vandoeuvre-Nancy Centre, in oper- ation since 1969, covers about three million inhabitants. Following a geographical rotating system, a letter is addressed to each family explaining the importance of a complete medical check-up for the detection of inapparent diseases in their early phase. For those accepting the offer, an appointment is arranged and questionnaires on health status are mailed for self-completion. The families (including children over four years old and adults up to 60 years) attend the Centre twice. At the first visit (lasting half a day) further questionnaires are completed with the aid of an interviewer, anthropometric measurements are obtained, clinical physiology (auditive, ocular, cardiovascular, respiratory) measurements are made and venous blood is drawn for laboratory tests. At a second visit, two weeks later, the families meet a Centre physician for a physical examination, comments on the biological tests and a general conclusion about their health status. In order to study the determinants of pulmonary function in children and adolescents in north-eastern France, parents were offered supplementary-pulmonary function testing for children* in the 10 to 16 year age range between May and November 1983. This sixmonth period was deliberately chosen as the invited population came from a region with no atmospheric • Pulmonary function wai not included in the routine battery of test! for this age group. pollution. We selected children in this age range since they were old enough to cooperate in a complex respiratory manoeuvre, but unlikely to have become active smokers. The names of the children were taken sequentially from the Centre of Preventive Medicine computer list with a limit of 10 children per half day; between 5 and 20 children were examined daily. The purpose of the study was briefly explained to the parents and to the children in order to obtain informed consent and optimal cooperation. The study protocol was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Medical \"Research of the University Hospital and Centre for Preventive Medicine. A total of 684 subjects were examined, but the results for the first 149 (seen between 20 May and 11 June 1983) had to be deleted because of repeated technical failure of the spirometric semi-automated module. Thereafter, a computerized spirometer was satisfactorily used. Of the 535 children seen between June and November 1983, 14 were excluded because of incomplete medical history or for various clinical reasons (obesity, epilepsia, neuro-, muscular disorders), leaving 521 children. Fifteen of these were unable to perform the forced expirogram correctly, so that 506 subjects were included in the study. The study protocol consisted of a questionnaire (filled in by interviewing one parent), a forced expiration test and a single-breath nitrogen (SBN 2 ) washout test. We .used the Children's Questionnaire recommended by the American Thoracic Society Epidemiology Standardization Project* which was designed for self-completion by a parent or for personal interview. Although no physical examination was done, at the time pulmonary function testing was performed the child was asked if he had had a 'cold' (running or blocked nose, sore throat, cough) during the last 2-3 days and the presence of respiratory signs (rhinorea, hoarse voice, cough) was noted. The child was further invited to cough and the observer noted the result as 'loose' or 'dry'. 3 The forced vital capacity (FVC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV,), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMF) and the forced expiratory flows (FEF) at 75-50 and 25% (to be expired) FVC were measured with an electronic spirometer (SPIROMATIC, Constructions L. Martin SA). A Fleisch n° 3 pneumotachograph measured the expired flow; the output was electronically linearized to 16 l.s\" 1 ; volume was obtained by integration. The flow and volume signals were fed into a micro-computer (Apple U, Cupertino, California) which stored the results together with the subject identification data and computed the predicted values. The system met the ATS Standards on Spirometry; calibration was done twice daily with a 3 litre syringe. At least three flow-volume curves were obtained; the best values were recorded for FVC, FEV, and PEF, while the FEF were calculated on the curves with the largest sum FVC plus FEV^ The results were expressed in ml BTPS and in % of the predicted values obtained from the equations of Zapletal el al? The SBN 2 test was done using a computerized assembly as previously described. ' The expired volume (Fleisch n° 1 pneumotachograph + integrator) and N 2 concentration measured at the mouth (Hewlett-Packard 47302 A analyser) were fed into a micro-computer (Apple II) which calculated the alveolar (phase m) nitrogen slope (P HI, %Nj.l \"') . the closing volume, expressed in ml BTPS and in % of vital capacity (CV/WC, %), the total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) from the alveolar dilution equation 9 and the closing capacity (CC, sum of CV and RV, expressed in ml and in % of TLC). The pneumotachograph-integrator was calibrated twice a day with a 1-litre syringe. The N 2 analyser had its zero level set with pure oxygen, the upper point of the scale was set on ambient air FN 2 adjusting for temperature and humidity and the linearity was checked with high-precision N 2 +O 2 mixtures. The subject performed at least two trials, preceded by a full inspiration and separated by a three minute pause; the expired vital capacity had to be within 13% of the separately measured FVC 1011 and the expiratory flow was kept below 0.5 l.s-1 . The result reported is the arithmetic mean of 2 or 3 trials. The inspiratory and expiratory valves were driven by the computer program, the respiratory flows and volumes were displayed on a screen so that the technician giving the test could concentrate on coaching and encouraging the child. Despite this, the number of failures was notably larger than for the forced expiration, only 415 children satisfactorily completing the SBNj test. The association between binary data was assessed by the x 2 test. Analysis of variance and the Student't' test were used for comparing means of different groups. 12 The information on respiratory symptoms or signs at the time of the study was not recorded for one child, so that the results for 505 children (240 girls) are presented: 65 children had respiratory symptoms or signs when tested; 7 of them had symptoms (cough with sputum) or signs (loose cough, fever) of lower airways involvement, while in the other 58 the symptoms (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, sneezing, sore throat) were limited to the upper airways, thus corresponding to an abortive or mildly severe 'common cold'. u A preliminary analysis indicated no difference for functional indices (eg FVC103.1 ±6.5 versus 102.1 ± 10.6% predicted for children with lower and upper airway involvement) between the two subgroups and we decided to combine them. Among the 65 children with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) at the time of the study 46 (ie more than two-thirds) were boys; the association between presence of ARI and male sex was significant (x 2 = 10.01, p < 0.01). Age, height and weight (Table 1) did not differ significantly between the two groups in either sex. For the sake of brevity, only results expressed in per cent of predicted values are reported for spirometry and forced flows. Boys with ARI had significantly lower FEV, FEV,, PEF, MMF and FEF»» as compared to those without; no difference was found in girls ( Table 2) . ARI did not influence static lung volumes, distribution of inspired gas or small airways closure, with the exception of a slightly significant increase in the RV/TLC ratio and phase HI N 2 slope in boys (Table 3) . Looking for the influence of age, we separated the children in two subgroups at age 13 (Table 4) ; again, no anthropometric differences were found between children with and without ARI (Table 4) . When the results of ventilatory function variables of boys were analysed by age, although some effect was present in subjects under 13, the differences were larger and statistical significance was reached (for FEV,. O , MMF and MEF) in boys aged 13 to 16 years (Table 5) . MEFjo* was 15.3% lower than predicted in boys with ARI-a difference significant at the 1 % level (Table 5) . A higher proportion of children with chronic respiratory symptoms among the subgroup with ARI could have influenced the results. We therefore excluded the subjects with a history of chronic cough, sputum production or wheeze, and repeated the analysis of pulmonary function. Thirty-nine children had acute symptoms or signs being otherwise asymptomatic; the proportion of boys (27 versus 12 girls) was still significantly increased (x 1 = 7.20, p < 0.007). The ventilatory function was decreased again for children with ARI; the differences between the mean values of functional indices were the same, the lower number of subjects limited the statistical power. Among the SBN 2 variables, only P III was just significantly altered in children with ARI after excluding children with chronic respiratory symptoms (1.19±0.50 versus 1.05±0.39, p < 0.05). Finally, we repeated the analysis after excluding the children who smoked; the results (47 children with ARI versus 301 children without) did not differ from those presented in Tables 2 and 3 . This study indicates significant impairment of pulmonary function in children with symptoms or signs of acute respiratory infection confirming and extending previous findings in children 14 and adults. 3 Standard questionnaires (practically all derived from the original British MRC Questionnaire on Respiratory Symptoms 15 ) are used to define chronic bronchitis, asthma and related conditions.\" Only chronic symptoms are recorded, however, by these questionnaires; in epi- demiological studies on lung function acute respiratory symptoms should not be present at the time of study, although this is rarely specified. Acute respiratory infections in children represent a most important public health problem.\" Practically all are of viral origin; with the exception of adeno-and herpes viruses (containing DNA) all the other viruses causing ARI contain ribonucleic acid (RNA). U ' 18 Although various viruses can elicit ARI of variable severity, the more severe forms of infection are due to influenza, respiratory syncytial and adenoviruses, while milder forms are mostly due to coronavirus, parainfluenza and rhinoviruses. 13 -18 '\" Some authors divide ARI into upper and lower respiratory tract infections; we choose to follow Crofton and Douglas 13 who recognize six clinical pictures (the coryzal, pharyngeal, pharyngoconjunctival, influenza, herpangina, and croup syndromes) and four severity categories (abortive, mild, moderate, and severe colds). The effect of acute respiratory infections on lung function was not the primary objective of our study; in fact, the survey was scheduled for summer and early autumn, with the hope of avoiding the viral epidemics of the cold season. As the first outbreak of infection occurred, we recorded the presence of symptoms in order to exclude these children for the analysis. When a second outbreak appeared we decided to analyse the subgroup with respiratory symptoms or signs as it comprised a considerable number of children. No attempt was made to identify the virus (viruses) responsible for the infection. However, in only 7 of the 65 children studied did the clinical picture correspond to a moderately severe 'common cold'. u Various pulmonary function disturbances have been documented in moderate or severe ARI due to adenovirus, 20 respiratory syncytial or influenza viruses; 21 -22 for the sake of brevity the present discussion will be limited to the effects of less aggressive viruses. Also, we will mainly discuss the results of naturally acquired infections in healthy children or adults; the results of experimental infections, the consequences of vaccinations with live attenuated viruses, and those of ARI in subjects with chronic lung diseases will be only briefly mentioned. Picken et af 3 were the first to report pulmonary function changes during an upper respiratory tract infection. The serial study of 12 healthy subjects suggested the involvement of 'small airways' (frequencydependence of dynamic compliance) 4-8 weeks after the start of the infection, with a return to normal after an additional four weeks. In a follow-up study of 18 healthy adults Cate et aP* recorded pulmonary function during 24 illness episodes caused by eight rhinovirus strains. While no consistent effects on ventilary function were found, these authors noticed a significant decrease in steady-state diffusing capacity-a finding attributed by them to ventilation inhomogeneity due to bronchiolitis. The study by Fridy et aP 5 included 52 subjects, 22 of whom returned for serial studies of pulmonary function during and after a mild viral respiratory illness. A complete battery of pulmonary function tests was used (static lung volumes, closing volume, air-and helium-flow-volume curves); the pulmonary function changes, suggesting peripheral airways obstruction, occurred only in smokers, and persisted for several weeks. Using experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy volunteers, Blair et aP 6 demonstrated the greater sensitivity of frequency-dependence of dynamic compliance which became abnormal when closing volume, maximal expiratory flows, specific conductance were unchanged. For Bush et aP 1 the most sensitive test was the volume of isoflow, and the methacholine response became positive in the three (out of seven) subjects developing lower airways and systemic symptoms. An increase in bronchia] reactivity is in agreement with clinical data 2 * showing that more than half of rhinovirus infection episodes are associated with wheezing in children and adults. Airway hyperreactivity may be the consequence of sensitization of airway epithelial receptors after mucosal cell damage, of a diminished adrenergic response of bronchial smooth muscle, or of histamine release secondary to virus infection. 29 The subject remains controversial, however, as negative results have also been recently reported. XM The only study of pulmonary function in normal children with upper respiratory infections was done in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, by Collier et al. 1 * A total of 55 children aged 2.5 to 11 years were followed for a mean duration of two years, yielding 617 'well' and 237 'illness' observations. Lung function tests comprised spirometry (including forced expiratory flows) and static lung volumes (helium dilution); the observed lung function values were adjusted (by sex) for height and clinical status (normal or upper respiratory illness). Adjusted mean values of FVC, FEV,, PEF, MMF, and FEF»* decreased during upper respiratory illness, the differences between the mean values of the 'illness' and 'well' observations were not significant in children over seven years of age. In younger children, FVC, FEV,, PEF and FEFjo* showed significant difference in girls, while only FVC and PEF did so in boys. TLC and the functional residual capacity did not differ in any sex-age group. In the present study, age, height and weight were not significantly different in children with and without ARI allowing the comparison of absolute values of lung function results. The presence of an ARI was significantly associated with male sex, and pulmonary function was impaired in boys but not in girls. This finding suggests that male gender increases vulnerability for respiratory disease not only in adults, 32 but also in children. Most ventilatory function indices were decreased in boys with ARI. The differences between means ranged from 3-4% for FVC and FEV] to more than 10% for FEFJO* (p < 0.001). We were somewhat surprised to find a non-significant difference for FEF^*, as this index is in principle more sensitive to early airflow limitation. 33 Our results confirmed the lack of sensitivity of this index for detecting abnormality during ARI in children 14 -21 and adults; 3 this is attributable in part to the high coefficient of variation. In the children studied by us the differences in the whole group were exclusively due to impairment of lung function in boys. The sex difference observed was not due to statistical factors (lower inter-subject variability in boys) but to the absence of any effect of 33 A narrowing of airways is expected to have a greater effect on airway resistance or forced flows the smaller the baseline diameter is. Contrary to this prediction, and to the results of Collier et a/, 14 we found the differences in ventilatory function to be significant in older boys (Table 5) . Although we find no obvious explanation for this, it should be stressed that the comparison between this study and that of Collier et al is limited by several important differences. First, their study was a prospective longitudinal one, each child having several measurements done; they were able to statistically validate minimal differences in pulmonary function (eg 50 ml or 50 ml s~'). Second, their children were much younger than those studied by us (2.5 to 11 years old). Third, 66% of their children were black, and racial differences in the reaction to virus infection may exist. In our study, lung volumes and distribution of ventilation were less influenced by ARI, confirming the negative results of Collier et al. 14 There was one exception to this, however. In boys, a slight increase of the RV/TLC ratio accompanied a marginally significant increase of phase HI slope (Table 3) . Although minor, these changes are of interest because the same two variables were altered (borderline statistical significance) in a group of asymptomatic adults with a history of recent acute respiratory infection. 36 - 37 An increase in RV and in P III slope was reported by Coates et a/ 38 after experimental iv infusion of saline in man; this suggests that peripheral airway obstruction (revealed by hyperinflation and altered distribution of ventilation) accompanies minimal increases in interstitial lung fluid. Closing volume and closing capacity proved to be of no value in detecting abnormality, in agreement with a previous report on passive exposure to tobacco smoke. 39 The impairment of pulmonary function variables in children with ARI was not due to the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms, since the results were unchanged (with unavoidable loss of statistical significance) when the analysis was restricted to the 39 children without chronic symptoms (Table 6 ). Tobacco smoking did not interact with the influence of ARI since the exclusion of 18 children who smoked among the symptomatic group had no influence on the results. Atmospheric pollution is known to increase the incidence of respiratory infections in children;* this influ-ence was excluded in the present study as the children came from a non-polluted area. Other factors, which were not controlled in this analysis, are represented by parental respiratory symptoms, 41 parental smoking, 41 -42 socioeconomic and educational level 43 or housing conditions. 44 Can a mild ARI have consequences in the long term? In contrast to the severe infections due to aggressive viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) whose sequels are well known, 43 the reported regression of physiological disturbances over 3 to 6 weeks 13 -23 allows this question to be answered in the negative, at least for healthy subjects. The effect of repeated (even mild) 'insults' of the respiratory tract by 'benign' viruses in children with chronic respiratory disease remains to be assessed. In conclusion, we have found consistent, statistically significant, impairment of ventilatory function in a group of 10-16 year old children with mild acute respiratory infection on the day of the study. Functional disturbances were present among boys, but not girls; they were more important in older children (13 to 16 years). The effect was independent of tobacco consumption and of the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms. Ventilatory defects did not fit the classical obstructive type, since both FEV! and FVC were decreased in equal proportions, the FEVj/FVC ratio being unchanged. Taken as a whole, the tests of 'small airway dysfunction' were less sensitive as compared to spirometry in detecting abnormality due to ARI, with the exception of a borderline increase in the RV/TLC ratio and of phase in N 2 slope in boys. As functional signs of large (eg PFR, FEV!) and small airways (RV/ TLC, PITI) co-exist, it can be concluded that the whole respiratory tract is functionally affected by an ARI. The present results support the proposal of the GAP Conference Committee 44 that paediatric reference standards for lung function tests should be obtained on children with no present acute respiratory symptoms and no history of an upper respiratory tract infection during the preceding weeks.",

         "The antiviral function of pulmonary macrophages obtained by broncholavage of healthy smokers and nonsmokers was studied. Compared with nonsmokers' cells, smokers' macrophages produced significantly more virus during in vitro infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-l). Exposure of macrophages to either antiviral macrophage-activating factor or interferon-y for 20 hr before infection resulted in diminished production of HSV-l by both types of macrophages. However, in contrast to smokers' cells, exposure of nonsmokers' macrophages to these antivirallymphokines totally prevented viral replication. This difference could not be attributed to diminished adsorption of virus to smokers' macrophages or to an increased proportion of extracellular to intracellular virus in smokers' cell cultures. The effect of smoking on viral infectivity did not appear to be mediated by secretion of a soluble factor by the macrophage because incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatant from smokers' cell cultures did not affect the growth of HSV-l. Cigarette smoking increases both the risk and severity of viral infection of the respiratory tract. Healthy young adult smokers have more frequent acute infections of the respiratory tract than do nonsmokers of the same age [1, 2] . During episodes of acute nonspecific illness in the respiratory tract, smokers report more symptoms [3] and develop more signs [4] in the lower respiratory tract than do nonsmokers. Although the etiology of acute illness in the respiratory tract was not characterized in some of these studies, a substantial proportion of acute nonspecific illness in the respiratory tract is caused by viral infection [5] . Smoking has been found to influence the impact of respiratory tract infection on the host in studies in which definite viral etiology has been specified. During an epidemic of influenza (HINI) in young soldiers, smoking was associated with increased risk of development of clinically apparent infection as well as increased likelihood of a severe influenza syn-drome [6] . In chronic bronchitis in which smoking is the major causative factor [7] , rates of viral infections in the respiratory tract are greater in smoking than in nonsmoking controls for rhinoviruses [8] , respiratory syncytial virus [9] , influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and coronavirus OC 43 [9, 10] . Viral infection of the respiratory tract is also responsible for substantial morbidity in chronic bronchitis; viruses have been implicated in up to one-third of all exacerbations of bronchitis [11, 12] . In spite of the impact of cigarette smoking on viral infection of the respiratory tract, little is known about how smoking alters respiratory defenses against viruses. The pulmonary macrophage is a principal cellular defense in the lung against infectious agents, including viruses [13, 14] . Because various functional, metabolic, and structural alterations have been demonstrated in this cell as a result of exposure to tobacco smoke, it is reasonable to speculate that certain critical antiviral functions of the pulmonary macrophage may also be affected by smoking. For this reason we assessed the infectivity of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-l) for pulmonary macrophages from healthy smokers and nonsmokers. Because macrophage mechanisms for restricting viral growth may be activated in vivo by lymphokines, soluble mediators of the immune response [15, 16] , we also investigated the possibility that smoking affects lung defenses by altering macrophage responsiveness to antiviral lymphokines. Source of m acroph ages. Pulmonary macrophages were harvested from healthy smokers and nonsmokers as described previously [17] . All volunteers for this study were screened by standardized questionnaire [18] , chest auscultation, and spirometry [19] . Individuals were excluded from this study if they had a history or evidence of chronic pulmonary disease, abnormal lung sounds, or abnormal spirometry. To ensure that macrophages were free of respiratory viruses and had not been recently exposed to endogenous antiviral mediators such as interferon, we only accepted volunteers for broncholavage if they were free of all respiratory tract symptoms for the prior two weeks. All smokers identified in this fashion smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day (range, one to 2.5 packs per day) for two years (range, two to 12 years). Because preliminary studies confirmed the work of Daniels et al. [20] , which demonstrated that monocytes obtained from HSV-l-seropositive and -seronegative donors were equally permissive for viral replication, the serological status of the donor was not taken into account in these studies. Macrophage infection. Pulmonary macrophages were isolated from broncholavage fluid by centrifugation at 100 g for 10 min at 20 C. They were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer, 50 ug of gentamicin/ml, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10070 heated-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells (5 x 10 5 ) were seeded in 35-mm plastic dishes with 2-mm grids (Miles Laboratories, Naperville, Ill) to facilitate counting. Cells remaining adherent after incubation for 3 hr were >97070 viable, as assessed by ability to exclude trypan blue, and >94070 phagocytic of latex beads 1.1 urn in diameter. Cells from smokers and nonsmokers were similar with respect to viability and phagocytic ability. However, smokers' cells exhibited morphological differences from nonsmokers' cells by light microscopy: smokers' cells appeared larger, spread more rapidly on plastic, and contained numerous refractile intracytoplasmic inclusions. Within 24 hr of isolation, macrophages were infected with KOS strain HSV-l at an moi of 20:1 by exposure of cells to virus (0.1 ml) for 60 min at 37 C in an atmosphere of 95070 room air and 5070 CO2 • Unadsorbed virus was removed by three washes with media. At intervals after infection, virus present in the Rose et of. supernatant of macrophage cultures was quantitated by determination of the number of viral pfu in replicate cultures of Vero cells [21] . In this assay 1% pooled human serum was used as a source of HSV-I-specific antibody to neutralize virus released into the culture medium after lysis of infected cells and to prevent spread of released virus to noninfected cells. Adsorption of HSV-l to macrophages was determined after exposure of cells to viral inoculum for 1 hr, followed by extensive washing of cells with serum-free medium to remove unadsorbed virus. Adsorbed virus was then quantitated by freeze-thawing cells at -70 C and measurement of the number of viral pfu in the lysate. Freeze-thawing cells in this manner resulted in complete disruption of macrophage cultures (as seen by light microscopy) from both smokers and nonsmokers. Cell-associated virus was quantitated at intervals after infection in a fashion analogous to the method used for determination of initial adsorption of HSV-l to cells. Cells were quantitated by counting pulmonary macrophages remaining on one of the four central grids of the 35-mm dish. This technique was feasible because all nonadherent cells were nonviable. Virus-specific cytolysis was determined as described previously [22] by comparison of the number of remaining cells in infected cultures at intervals after infection to those present in infected wells at 1 hr after exposure to virus. The latter number was multiplied by the percentage of cytolysis in uninfected cells at the time under analysis to account for nonspecific cell death in macrophage cultures. Modification of infection in nonsmokers' cells by exposure to supernatant from cultures of smokers' macrophages was attempted by incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatants (50070 by volume) from one-to three-day-old cultures of smokers' cells for 24 hr before viral infection. Preparation oflymphokines and macrophage activation. Human interferon-gamma (IFN-y) was obtained from Meloy Laboratories (Springfield, Va). Antiviral macrophage-activating factor (AV-MAF) was prepared from concanavalin A (10 ug/rnljstimulated human leukocyte concentrates obtained as a by-product of plateletpheresis as described previously [23] . This procedure involves partial purification of leukocyte supernatants by gel filtration on a column (2.5 x 100em) of Sephadex\" G-IOO(Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ), followed by isoelectric focusing of the effluent on ampholine Replication of HSV-I in untreated pulmonary macrophages from smokers and nonsmokers is shown in figure 1 . Peak viral growth occurred 24 hr after initiation of infection in cells from both sources; viral growth in smokers' macrophages was 10 times greater than growth in nonsmokers' cells (P < .01). This result could not be explained by differences in cell number between smokers' and nonsmokers' cell cultures because the initial number of adherent cells in these cultures before infection was similar and because >800/0 cell lysis was observed in both smokers' and nonsmokers' cell cultures by 48 hr after infection. At the time of greatest viral replication (24 hr), infectivity of HSV-I was greater for smokers' cells when corrected for cell count (pfu per cell, 3.39 ± 0.51 and 0.35 ± 0.10 for smokers' and nonsmokers' cell cultures, respectively). (50 ul/ml) for 20 hr before infection resulted in diminished viral replication in both smokers' and nonsmokers' cells compared with cells exposed to mediator control (figure 2). In cells from nonsmokers, inhibition of viral replication was observed at both 24 and 48 hr after infection. In contrast, smokers' cells exposed to AV-MAF were not capable of totally suppressing viral growth, as evidenced by an increase in the amount of virus recovered during the first 24 hr after infection. Exposure to AV-MAF protected cells from smokers and nonsmokers to a simi-Control macrophage cultures were exposed to the mediator control fraction (50 ul/rnl) in a similar fashion. Quantitation of cellular protein. The cellular protein concentration was determined in uninfected macrophage cultures grown in serum-free medium after incubation for 3 hr. Nonadherent cells were first removed by gentle washing, and intracellular protein in the remaining adherent cells was released into the culture supernatant by freeze-thawing once at -70 C. The concentration of protein was quantitated by a modification [25] of the Lowry assay, based on the differential A S 9 S of Coomassie'\" brilliant blue 0-250 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif) when protein binding occurs. Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed by a noninpaired Student's t test [26] . 24 48 Hours after Infection Previous studies in human pulmonary macrophages from nonsmoking donors and a transformed human macrophage-like cell line, V937, demonstrated that the fraction containing antiviral activity against HSV-I in macrophage effector cells was the one with an isoelectric point between 1.4 and 2.2 [22] . This fraction contained no detectable IFN-y activity when tested in a classical interferon assay with human fibroblasts [24] and was not neutralized by monoclonal antibody to IFN-y [22] . This fraction is therefore referred to as AV-MAF. A mediator control fraction was prepared in an analogous manner from the supernatant of unstimulated leukocytes. Concanavalin A (10 ug/ml) was added to mediator control supernatant after removal of cells. Macrophages were activated by exposure to either IFN-y (500 Vlml) or AV-MAF (50 ul/rnl) for 20 hr at 37 C in an atmosphere of 950/0 room air and 50/0 CO 2 • Before infection, mediator was removed by three washes of the cells in serum-free medium. In previous studies these conditions were the optimal concentration and incubation period to achieve activation of antiviral mechanisms of nonsmoker macrophages in this in vitro system [22] . The concentration of AV-MAF used in these experiments was expressed as J.lI of the lymphokine-containing fraction concentrated to I/50th the volume of the original supernatant by vacuum concentration. was observed in the number of virions per cell at 24 hr of infection compared with cells exposed to a lower viral inoculum (20 virions per cell): 0.39 ± 0.18 pfu per cell for the larger inoculum versus 0.35 ± 0.1 as shown earlier for the smaller inoculum. Maximal viral replication and lymphokine-mediated viral inhibition were similarly unaltered (data not shown). Exposure of cells to an inoculum of >100 virions per cell was associated with cytotoxicity within 8 hr after exposure and was not tested further. lar degree from virus-specific cytolysis. At 48 hr after infection, mean ± SD cytolysis in smokers' cell cultures was 77.70/0 ± 40/0 with addition of mediator control and 48.60/0 ± 10/0 with addition of AV-MAF, compared with 80.680/0 ± 1.60/0 and 48.90/0 ± 1.80/0 for nonsmokers' cell cultures, respectively. Exposure of macrophages to IFN-y (500 U/ml) diminished viral growth in both smokers' and nonsmokers' cells but only totally inhibited viral replication in nonsmokers' cells ( figure 3) . To examine the possibility that the different response of smokers' cells to AV-MAF could be attributable to the use of suboptimal concentrations of this lymphokine to activate cells, we pretreated smokers' macrophages with different amounts of AV-MAF before initiation of infection (table I) . In these studies the maximal antiviral effect was achieved with 50 J..LVml, the amount used in the experiment shown in figure 2. Incubation of cells with 200 ul of AV-MAF/ml resulted in 100/0-150/0 cell death and was not tested further. Exposure of smokers' cells for periods as long as 48 hr or as short as 8 hr to AV-MAF before infection did not result in diminished viral growth compared with cells exposed to this lymphokine for 20 hr (data not shown). In three experiments nonsmokers' cells were exposed to an increased moi ( NOTE. The ratio of cell-associated HSV-I to the total amount of virus recovered was determined by separate quantitation of viral pfu in celllysates (cell-associated virus) and culture supernatants and addition of these values to obtain the total amount of virus for each interval studied. Data are mean values from three experiments. Because exposure to tobacco smoke alters the ultrastructure of the pulmonary macrophage plasma membrane [27] , it is possible that the abnormalities in viral infectivity and lymphokine responses observed in smokers' cells are related to alterations in initial adsorption of virus to the cell surface. Smokers' macrophages exposed or not exposed to lymphokine adsorbed more virus on a per cell basis than did nonsmokers' cells after exposure for 1 hr to HSV-l (table 2). For determination of whether this finding is the result of altered binding of HSV-l to the macrophage plasma membrane or is attributable to the larger volume of the smokers' macrophage [28] , virus initially adsorbed to cells was quantitated with respect to the amount of protein present in cell lysates of macrophage cultures to account for differences in cell size. There were no differences between smokers' and nonsmokers' cells or lymphokineexposed and control cells in terms of amount of cellassociated virus per ug of macrophage protein (table 2). Thus, smokers' macrophages adsorbed more HSV-l at 1 hr after infection on a per cell basis than did nonsmokers' cells, but this difference appears attributable to the larger surface area of smokers' cells. To examine the possibility that differences between smokers' and nonsmokers' cells are related to an altered capacity of smokers' cells to excrete virus, we measured the ratio of cell-associated virus to the total amount of virus recovered in celllysates and supernatants. This value was comparable between smokers' and nonsmokers' cells (table 3) . It does not appear therefore that increased release of virus into culture medium from smokers' cells accounts for en-hanced infectivity of HSV-l for smokers' cells or for the diminished response of smokers' cells to antiviral lymphokines. To investigate the possibility of whether smokers' macrophages secrete a substance capable of altering viral infectivity in nonsmokers' cells, we incubated macrophages from nonsmokers with supernatants from unstimulated smokers' macrophages for one day before infection. In three experiments viral replication in nonsmokers' cells was unaffected by prior exposure to supernatant from cultures of smokers' cells. Maximal viral replication was 2.8 ± 1.7 x 10 5 pfu/ml for cells exposed to medium alone and 1.76 ± 1.1 x 10 5 pfu/ml for cells exposed to medium containing smokers' supernatant (50070 by volume). These studies demonstrate that cigarette smoking can alter lung cellular defenses against HSV-l in two distinct ways: (l) Smoking enhances infectivity of HSV-l for macrophages, and (2) smoking leads to suboptimal activation of antiviral activity in macrophages by two lymphokines (AV-MAF and IFN-y). These data describe the interaction of macrophages with a single virus; the relevance of these findings to other respiratory viruses is unclear. However, these observations raise the possibility that abnormal antiviral responses of macrophages may be one pathogenic mechanism underlying the increased incidence and severity of viral infection in the respiratory tract in smokers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [8] [9] [10] . Although exposure to tobacco smoke can affect other aspects of lung defense, such as mucociliary transport [29] , noncellular defenses may be less important than phagocytic cells in eradication of infectious agents from the respiratory tract [30] . For this reason alteration of critical antiviral functions in pulmonary macrophages by cigarette smoke could have a substantial impact on the fate of viruses that reach the lower respiratory tract. Inability of smokers' macrophages to restrict viral replication could lead to increased production of virus within pulmonary airways and parenchyma at an early phase of infection, when the spread of virus cannot be limited by immune factors. Diminished activation of antiviral mechanisms in smokers' macrophages by lymphokines may also interfere with the effectiveness of macrophages at a later stage of infection, after cellular immunity has developed. In the in vitro system used in these studies to evaluate macrophage antiviral responses, a single viral agent, HSV-l, was tested. This virus is an uncommon cause of respiratory tract infection in immunocompetent humans: In one series, HSV-l was recovered in 5070 of all episodes of communityacquired infections of the lower respiratory tract, compared with an isolation rate of 1.4070 in healthy controls [31] . This virus may also be a cause of serious pneumonitis in immunosuppressed individuals [32, 33] . Nevertheless, HSV-l has been an exceptionally useful agent to probe antiviral responses of macrophages in vitro because it grows rapidly in macrophages, produces cell lysis, and can be inhibited by lymphokine-activated macrophages [22, 34, 35] . One of the lymphokines used in these studies, IFN-y, has been associated with augmentation of mononuclear phagocyte activity against neoplastic and infectious processes [36] [37] [38] . On the other hand, AV-MAF is an unique lymphokine that, like IFN-y, is capable of activating antiviral activity of macrophages [22] but can be separated from IFN-y in the supernatant of human peripheral blood leukocytes by preparative isoelectric focusing [22] [23] [24] . The suboptimal responses of smokers' pulmonary macrophages to both these lymphokines may have important implications for the effect of smoking on other lymphokinemediated activities of macrophages, such as killing tumor cells and other intracellular parasites (e.g., Legionella pneumophila), because both lung cancer and legionellosis are more common in smokers than nonsmokers [7, 39] . These studies extended the spectrum of functional abnormalities in macrophages that have been at-tributed to cigarette smoke. Smoking has been shown to depress antibacterial activity of pulmonary macrophages in vitro [40] [41] [42] and inhibit phagolysosome fusion [43] , a crucial mechanism for eradication of certain intracellular microbes. Only one previous study assessed the impact of smoking on macrophage responses to lymphokines. Human pulmonary macrophages from smokers had diminished responses to macrophage migration-inhibitory factor [44] . These functional alterations may be based on metabolic or structural changes in macrophages produced by exposure to tobacco smoke. For instance, macrophage levels of the energy-generating enzymes adenosine triphosphatase [45] and glucose-3phosphate dehydrogenase [46] are diminished in smokers' cells and may be responsible for lowered rates of phagocytosis observed in smokers' macrophages. Similarly, smoking-related ultrastuctural changes, consisting of increased blebs and lamellipodia, in the macrophage plasma membrane have been implicated in altered pinocytosis and endocytosis [27] . Although in the present studies we did not elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for increased infectivity and diminished lymphokine response in smokers' macrophages, these alterations could not be explained by increased release of intracellular virus into culture medium during infection (table 3) or by differences between the optimal concentration of lymphokine needed to produce an antiviral state in smokers' and nonsmokers' cells (table 1) . Moreover, macrophage abnormalities associated with smoking do not appear to be the result of exposure of cells to a soluble factor secreted by smokers' macrophages because incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatant from smokers' cell cultures did not alter the infectivity of HSY-l for cells treated in this manner. Altered antiviral responses of smokers' macrophages may be due in part to enhanced initial adsorption of HSY-l (table 2). Because the amount of virus adsorbed to smokers' and nonsmokers' cells is similar when corrected for intracellular protein concentration (table 2), increased uptake of HSY-l by smoker's cells appears to be related to a larger surface area available for attachment of virus. This conclusion is in contrast to a previous study that found only a small size difference in these cell populations on the basis of direct measurement of cell diameter [28] . This method of assessing cell size could underestimate true cell volume compared with measurements of cellular protein concentration. By the latter method smokers' cells appeared nearly twice as large as nonsmokers' cells. On a per cell basis, smokers' macrophages are exposed to more than twice the amount of adsorbed virus as are nonsmokers' cells (table 2) . It may be, therefore, that increased infectivity of HSV-I for smokers' cells results from greater initial adsorption of virus, diminished ability of the extra protein in smokers' cells to limit viral replication, or both. Thus, smoking appears to depress the intrinsic antiviral activity of macrophages against HSV-I and diminish the augmentation of this activity by lymphokines. Further studies are needed to clarify the relevance of these observations for other respiratory viruses and other lymphokine-directed macrophage functions. The importance of smoking in acquired antiviral and immune deficiencies of macrophages remains speculative.",

During episodes of acute nonspecific illness in the respiratory tract, smokers report more symptoms [3] and develop more signs [4] in the lower respiratory tract than do nonsmokers.

In chronic bronchitis in which smoking is the major causative factor [7] , rates of viral infections in the respiratory tract are greater in smoking than in nonsmoking controls for rhinoviruses [8] , respiratory syncytial virus [9] , influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and coronavirus OC 43 [9, 10] . Viral infection of the respiratory tract is also responsible for substantial morbidity in chronic bronchitis; viruses have been implicated in up to one-third of all exacerbations of bronchitis [11, 12] . In spite of the impact of cigarette smoking on viral infection of the respiratory tract, little is known about how smoking alters respiratory defenses against viruses. The pulmonary macrophage is a principal cellular defense in the lung against infectious agents, including viruses [13, 14] . Because various functional, metabolic, and structural alterations have been demonstrated in this cell as a result of exposure to tobacco smoke, it is reasonable to speculate that certain critical antiviral functions of the pulmonary macrophage may also be affected by smoking. For this reason we assessed the infectivity of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-l) for pulmonary macrophages from healthy smokers and nonsmokers. Because macrophage mechanisms for restricting viral growth may be activated in vivo by lymphokines, soluble mediators of the immune response [15, 16] , we also investigated the possibility that smoking affects lung defenses by altering macrophage responsiveness to antiviral lymphokines. Source of m acroph ages. Pulmonary macrophages were harvested from healthy smokers and nonsmokers as described previously [17] . All volunteers for this study were screened by standardized questionnaire [18] , chest auscultation, and spirometry [19] . Individuals were excluded from this study if they had a history or evidence of chronic pulmonary disease, abnormal lung sounds, or abnormal spirometry. To ensure that macrophages were free of respiratory viruses and had not been recently exposed to endogenous antiviral mediators such as interferon, we only accepted volunteers for broncholavage if they were free of all respiratory tract symptoms for the prior two weeks. All smokers identified in this fashion smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day (range, one to 2.5 packs per day) for two years (range, two to 12 years). Because preliminary studies confirmed the work of Daniels et al. [20] , which demonstrated that monocytes obtained from HSV-l-seropositive and -seronegative donors were equally permissive for viral replication, the serological status of the donor was not taken into account in these studies. Macrophage infection. Pulmonary macrophages were isolated from broncholavage fluid by centrifugation at 100 g for 10 min at 20 C. They were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer, 50 ug of gentamicin/ml, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10070 heated-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells (5 x 10 5 ) were seeded in 35-mm plastic dishes with 2-mm grids (Miles Laboratories, Naperville, Ill) to facilitate counting. Cells remaining adherent after incubation for 3 hr were >97070 viable, as assessed by ability to exclude trypan blue, and >94070 phagocytic of latex beads 1.1 urn in diameter. Cells from smokers and nonsmokers were similar with respect to viability and phagocytic ability. However, smokers' cells exhibited morphological differences from nonsmokers' cells by light microscopy: smokers' cells appeared larger, spread more rapidly on plastic, and contained numerous refractile intracytoplasmic inclusions. Within 24 hr of isolation, macrophages were infected with KOS strain HSV-l at an moi of 20:1 by exposure of cells to virus (0.1 ml) for 60 min at 37 C in an atmosphere of 95070 room air and 5070 CO2 • Unadsorbed virus was removed by three washes with media. At intervals after infection, virus present in the Rose et of. supernatant of macrophage cultures was quantitated by determination of the number of viral pfu in replicate cultures of Vero cells [21] . In this assay 1% pooled human serum was used as a source of HSV-I-specific antibody to neutralize virus released into the culture medium after lysis of infected cells and to prevent spread of released virus to noninfected cells. Adsorption of HSV-l to macrophages was determined after exposure of cells to viral inoculum for 1 hr, followed by extensive washing of cells with serum-free medium to remove unadsorbed virus. Adsorbed virus was then quantitated by freeze-thawing cells at -70 C and measurement of the number of viral pfu in the lysate. Freeze-thawing cells in this manner resulted in complete disruption of macrophage cultures (as seen by light microscopy) from both smokers and nonsmokers. Cell-associated virus was quantitated at intervals after infection in a fashion analogous to the method used for determination of initial adsorption of HSV-l to cells. Cells were quantitated by counting pulmonary macrophages remaining on one of the four central grids of the 35-mm dish. This technique was feasible because all nonadherent cells were nonviable. Virus-specific cytolysis was determined as described previously [22] by comparison of the number of remaining cells in infected cultures at intervals after infection to those present in infected wells at 1 hr after exposure to virus. The latter number was multiplied by the percentage of cytolysis in uninfected cells at the time under analysis to account for nonspecific cell death in macrophage cultures. Modification of infection in nonsmokers' cells by exposure to supernatant from cultures of smokers' macrophages was attempted by incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatants (50070 by volume) from one-to three-day-old cultures of smokers' cells for 24 hr before viral infection. Preparation oflymphokines and macrophage activation. Human interferon-gamma (IFN-y) was obtained from Meloy Laboratories (Springfield, Va). Antiviral macrophage-activating factor (AV-MAF) was prepared from concanavalin A (10 ug/rnljstimulated human leukocyte concentrates obtained as a by-product of plateletpheresis as described previously [23] . This procedure involves partial purification of leukocyte supernatants by gel filtration on a column (2.5 x 100em) of Sephadex\" G-IOO(Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ), followed by isoelectric focusing of the effluent on ampholine Replication of HSV-I in untreated pulmonary macrophages from smokers and nonsmokers is shown in figure 1 . Peak viral growth occurred 24 hr after initiation of infection in cells from both sources; viral growth in smokers' macrophages was 10 times greater than growth in nonsmokers' cells (P < .01). This result could not be explained by differences in cell number between smokers' and nonsmokers' cell cultures because the initial number of adherent cells in these cultures before infection was similar and because >800/0 cell lysis was observed in both smokers' and nonsmokers' cell cultures by 48 hr after infection. At the time of greatest viral replication (24 hr), infectivity of HSV-I was greater for smokers' cells when corrected for cell count (pfu per cell, 3.39 ± 0.51 and 0.35 ± 0.10 for smokers' and nonsmokers' cell cultures, respectively). (50 ul/ml) for 20 hr before infection resulted in diminished viral replication in both smokers' and nonsmokers' cells compared with cells exposed to mediator control (figure 2). In cells from nonsmokers, inhibition of viral replication was observed at both 24 and 48 hr after infection. In contrast, smokers' cells exposed to AV-MAF were not capable of totally suppressing viral growth, as evidenced by an increase in the amount of virus recovered during the first 24 hr after infection. Exposure to AV-MAF protected cells from smokers and nonsmokers to a simi-Control macrophage cultures were exposed to the mediator control fraction (50 ul/rnl) in a similar fashion. Quantitation of cellular protein. The cellular protein concentration was determined in uninfected macrophage cultures grown in serum-free medium after incubation for 3 hr. Nonadherent cells were first removed by gentle washing, and intracellular protein in the remaining adherent cells was released into the culture supernatant by freeze-thawing once at -70 C. The concentration of protein was quantitated by a modification [25] of the Lowry assay, based on the differential A S 9 S of Coomassie'\" brilliant blue 0-250 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif) when protein binding occurs. Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed by a noninpaired Student's t test [26] . 24 48 Hours after Infection Previous studies in human pulmonary macrophages from nonsmoking donors and a transformed human macrophage-like cell line, V937, demonstrated that the fraction containing antiviral activity against HSV-I in macrophage effector cells was the one with an isoelectric point between 1.4 and 2.2 [22] . This fraction contained no detectable IFN-y activity when tested in a classical interferon assay with human fibroblasts [24] and was not neutralized by monoclonal antibody to IFN-y [22] . This fraction is therefore referred to as AV-MAF. A mediator control fraction was prepared in an analogous manner from the supernatant of unstimulated leukocytes. Concanavalin A (10 ug/ml) was added to mediator control supernatant after removal of cells. Macrophages were activated by exposure to either IFN-y (500 Vlml) or AV-MAF (50 ul/rnl) for 20 hr at 37 C in an atmosphere of 950/0 room air and 50/0 CO 2 • Before infection, mediator was removed by three washes of the cells in serum-free medium. In previous studies these conditions were the optimal concentration and incubation period to achieve activation of antiviral mechanisms of nonsmoker macrophages in this in vitro system [22] . The concentration of AV-MAF used in these experiments was expressed as J.lI of the lymphokine-containing fraction concentrated to I/50th the volume of the original supernatant by vacuum concentration. was observed in the number of virions per cell at 24 hr of infection compared with cells exposed to a lower viral inoculum (20 virions per cell): 0.39 ± 0.18 pfu per cell for the larger inoculum versus 0.35 ± 0.1 as shown earlier for the smaller inoculum. Maximal viral replication and lymphokine-mediated viral inhibition were similarly unaltered (data not shown). Exposure of cells to an inoculum of >100 virions per cell was associated with cytotoxicity within 8 hr after exposure and was not tested further. lar degree from virus-specific cytolysis. At 48 hr after infection, mean ± SD cytolysis in smokers' cell cultures was 77.70/0 ± 40/0 with addition of mediator control and 48.60/0 ± 10/0 with addition of AV-MAF, compared with 80.680/0 ± 1.60/0 and 48.90/0 ± 1.80/0 for nonsmokers' cell cultures, respectively. Exposure of macrophages to IFN-y (500 U/ml) diminished viral growth in both smokers' and nonsmokers' cells but only totally inhibited viral replication in nonsmokers' cells ( figure 3) . To examine the possibility that the different response of smokers' cells to AV-MAF could be attributable to the use of suboptimal concentrations of this lymphokine to activate cells, we pretreated smokers' macrophages with different amounts of AV-MAF before initiation of infection (table I) . In these studies the maximal antiviral effect was achieved with 50 J..LVml, the amount used in the experiment shown in figure 2. Incubation of cells with 200 ul of AV-MAF/ml resulted in 100/0-150/0 cell death and was not tested further. Exposure of smokers' cells for periods as long as 48 hr or as short as 8 hr to AV-MAF before infection did not result in diminished viral growth compared with cells exposed to this lymphokine for 20 hr (data not shown). In three experiments nonsmokers' cells were exposed to an increased moi ( NOTE. The ratio of cell-associated HSV-I to the total amount of virus recovered was determined by separate quantitation of viral pfu in celllysates (cell-associated virus) and culture supernatants and addition of these values to obtain the total amount of virus for each interval studied. Data are mean values from three experiments. Because exposure to tobacco smoke alters the ultrastructure of the pulmonary macrophage plasma membrane [27] , it is possible that the abnormalities in viral infectivity and lymphokine responses observed in smokers' cells are related to alterations in initial adsorption of virus to the cell surface. Smokers' macrophages exposed or not exposed to lymphokine adsorbed more virus on a per cell basis than did nonsmokers' cells after exposure for 1 hr to HSV-l (table 2). For determination of whether this finding is the result of altered binding of HSV-l to the macrophage plasma membrane or is attributable to the larger volume of the smokers' macrophage [28] , virus initially adsorbed to cells was quantitated with respect to the amount of protein present in cell lysates of macrophage cultures to account for differences in cell size. There were no differences between smokers' and nonsmokers' cells or lymphokineexposed and control cells in terms of amount of cellassociated virus per ug of macrophage protein (table 2). Thus, smokers' macrophages adsorbed more HSV-l at 1 hr after infection on a per cell basis than did nonsmokers' cells, but this difference appears attributable to the larger surface area of smokers' cells. To examine the possibility that differences between smokers' and nonsmokers' cells are related to an altered capacity of smokers' cells to excrete virus, we measured the ratio of cell-associated virus to the total amount of virus recovered in celllysates and supernatants. This value was comparable between smokers' and nonsmokers' cells (table 3) . It does not appear therefore that increased release of virus into culture medium from smokers' cells accounts for en-hanced infectivity of HSV-l for smokers' cells or for the diminished response of smokers' cells to antiviral lymphokines. To investigate the possibility of whether smokers' macrophages secrete a substance capable of altering viral infectivity in nonsmokers' cells, we incubated macrophages from nonsmokers with supernatants from unstimulated smokers' macrophages for one day before infection. In three experiments viral replication in nonsmokers' cells was unaffected by prior exposure to supernatant from cultures of smokers' cells. Maximal viral replication was 2.8 ± 1.7 x 10 5 pfu/ml for cells exposed to medium alone and 1.76 ± 1.1 x 10 5 pfu/ml for cells exposed to medium containing smokers' supernatant (50070 by volume). These studies demonstrate that cigarette smoking can alter lung cellular defenses against HSV-l in two distinct ways: (l) Smoking enhances infectivity of HSV-l for macrophages, and (2) smoking leads to suboptimal activation of antiviral activity in macrophages by two lymphokines (AV-MAF and IFN-y). These data describe the interaction of macrophages with a single virus; the relevance of these findings to other respiratory viruses is unclear. However, these observations raise the possibility that abnormal antiviral responses of macrophages may be one pathogenic mechanism underlying the increased incidence and severity of viral infection in the respiratory tract in smokers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [8] [9] [10] . Although exposure to tobacco smoke can affect other aspects of lung defense, such as mucociliary transport [29] , noncellular defenses may be less important than phagocytic cells in eradication of infectious agents from the respiratory tract [30] . For this reason alteration of critical antiviral functions in pulmonary macrophages by cigarette smoke could have a substantial impact on the fate of viruses that reach the lower respiratory tract. Inability of smokers' macrophages to restrict viral replication could lead to increased production of virus within pulmonary airways and parenchyma at an early phase of infection, when the spread of virus cannot be limited by immune factors. Diminished activation of antiviral mechanisms in smokers' macrophages by lymphokines may also interfere with the effectiveness of macrophages at a later stage of infection, after cellular immunity has developed. In the in vitro system used in these studies to evaluate macrophage antiviral responses, a single viral agent, HSV-l, was tested. This virus is an uncommon cause of respiratory tract infection in immunocompetent humans: In one series, HSV-l was recovered in 5070 of all episodes of communityacquired infections of the lower respiratory tract, compared with an isolation rate of 1.4070 in healthy controls [31] . This virus may also be a cause of serious pneumonitis in immunosuppressed individuals [32, 33] . Nevertheless, HSV-l has been an exceptionally useful agent to probe antiviral responses of macrophages in vitro because it grows rapidly in macrophages, produces cell lysis, and can be inhibited by lymphokine-activated macrophages [22, 34, 35] . One of the lymphokines used in these studies, IFN-y, has been associated with augmentation of mononuclear phagocyte activity against neoplastic and infectious processes [36] [37] [38] . On the other hand, AV-MAF is an unique lymphokine that, like IFN-y, is capable of activating antiviral activity of macrophages [22] but can be separated from IFN-y in the supernatant of human peripheral blood leukocytes by preparative isoelectric focusing [22] [23] [24] . The suboptimal responses of smokers' pulmonary macrophages to both these lymphokines may have important implications for the effect of smoking on other lymphokinemediated activities of macrophages, such as killing tumor cells and other intracellular parasites (e.g., Legionella pneumophila), because both lung cancer and legionellosis are more common in smokers than nonsmokers [7, 39] . These studies extended the spectrum of functional abnormalities in macrophages that have been at-tributed to cigarette smoke. Smoking has been shown to depress antibacterial activity of pulmonary macrophages in vitro [40] [41] [42] and inhibit phagolysosome fusion [43] , a crucial mechanism for eradication of certain intracellular microbes. Only one previous study assessed the impact of smoking on macrophage responses to lymphokines. Human pulmonary macrophages from smokers had diminished responses to macrophage migration-inhibitory factor [44] . These functional alterations may be based on metabolic or structural changes in macrophages produced by exposure to tobacco smoke. For instance, macrophage levels of the energy-generating enzymes adenosine triphosphatase [45] and glucose-3phosphate dehydrogenase [46] are diminished in smokers' cells and may be responsible for lowered rates of phagocytosis observed in smokers' macrophages. Similarly, smoking-related ultrastuctural changes, consisting of increased blebs and lamellipodia, in the macrophage plasma membrane have been implicated in altered pinocytosis and endocytosis [27] . Although in the present studies we did not elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for increased infectivity and diminished lymphokine response in smokers' macrophages, these alterations could not be explained by increased release of intracellular virus into culture medium during infection (table 3) or by differences between the optimal concentration of lymphokine needed to produce an antiviral state in smokers' and nonsmokers' cells (table 1) . Moreover, macrophage abnormalities associated with smoking do not appear to be the result of exposure of cells to a soluble factor secreted by smokers' macrophages because incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatant from smokers' cell cultures did not alter the infectivity of HSY-l for cells treated in this manner. Altered antiviral responses of smokers' macrophages may be due in part to enhanced initial adsorption of HSY-l (table 2). Because the amount of virus adsorbed to smokers' and nonsmokers' cells is similar when corrected for intracellular protein concentration (table 2), increased uptake of HSY-l by smoker's cells appears to be related to a larger surface area available for attachment of virus. This conclusion is in contrast to a previous study that found only a small size difference in these cell populations on the basis of direct measurement of cell diameter [28] . This method of assessing cell size could underestimate true cell volume compared with measurements of cellular protein concentration. By the latter method smokers' cells appeared nearly twice as large as nonsmokers' cells. On a per cell basis, smokers' macrophages are exposed to more than twice the amount of adsorbed virus as are nonsmokers' cells (table 2) . It may be, therefore, that increased infectivity of HSV-I for smokers' cells results from greater initial adsorption of virus, diminished ability of the extra protein in smokers' cells to limit viral replication, or both. Thus, smoking appears to depress the intrinsic antiviral activity of macrophages against HSV-I and diminish the augmentation of this activity by lymphokines. Further studies are needed to clarify the relevance of these observations for other respiratory viruses and other lymphokine-directed macrophage functions. The importance of smoking in acquired antiviral and immune deficiencies of macrophages remains speculative.",

         "Interferon induction in porcine leukocytes with transmissible gastroenteritis virus",
         "Leukocytes were harvested from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node and small intestinal lamina propria from groups of three piglets before, and 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) at 2 weeks of age. The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-α or porcine IFN-τ on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-α antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-α was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-τ was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection. This was the first demonstration of IFN induction in vitro in leukocytes from porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissue.",

         "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine enteric coronavirus which causes severe diarrhoea, associated with villous atrophy in the small intestine, and high mortality in newborn piglets (Bohl, 1989) . La Bonnardirre and Laude ( 1981, 1983 ) demonstrated high levels of interferon (IFN) early in experimental TGE in the blood and intestine of newborn piglets, and they suggested that the IFN might have arisen from the enterocytes in the small intestine. In subsequent studies however, La Bonnardirre et al. ( 1986 ) identified the IFN as leukocytic IFN or porcine IFN-ol, but the tissue source of the IFN was not determined. It is well established that porcine IFN-o~ can be induced in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) by a variety of viruses (reviewed by Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1990) and in the case of TGEV it was shown by Charley and Laude ( 1988 ) that IFN induction was associated with an interaction of the viral transmembrane E 1 or M glycoprotein with the PBL cell membrane. In a recent study, Charley and Lavenant (1990) characterized the blood mononuclear cells which produced porcine IFN-a in response to induction with TGEV as non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4 + MHC-class-II-positive cells. Few studies on the induction of porcine IFN-a in leukocytes from sources other than peripheral blood have been described, although Salmon et al. (1989) induced IFN in splenic lymphocytes with influenza virus. In an earlier paper, La Bonnardi~re and Laude (1983) described the production of IFN in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures in response to infection with TGEV. The in vitro induction of porcine IFN-o~ in leukocytes from the gutassociated lymphoid tissue (GALT) has not been described, but immunoreactive IFN-a was found to be widely distributed in normal human tissues, including spindle-shaped cells in the jejunal lamina propria (Khan et al., 1989) . Porcine IFN-z has been less extensively studied than IFN-o~. As in other species, porcine IFN-z is a product of activated T-lymphocytes, and it was first induced by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in PBL by Yilma ( 1983 ) . Subsequently, Piasecki ( 1988 ) showed that porcine IFN-z from the same source exerted a synergistic antiviral action with porcine IFN-o~. studied the antiviral properties of recombinant porcine IFN-z, which was shown to have a protective effect on porcine cells challenged with TGEV, but the recombinant IFN was less protective than natural porcine IFN-o~. The induction of porcine IFN-z in lymphocytes from the GALT has not been described, but there is evidence of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to TGEV in these tissues. The earliest study was by Frederick and Bohl ( 1976 ) , who demonstrated the production of macrophage migration inhibition factor by leukocytes from the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine of pigs infected with TGEV. Blastogenic responses to TGEV antigen were demonstrated in lymphocytes from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) by Shimizu and Shimizu ( 1979a ) , and by , while Shimizu and Shimizu (1979b) showed that cytotoxic lymphocytes were generated in the Peyer's patches and MLN of pigs infected orally with TGEV. The objective of the present study was to determine the ability of leukocytes from the porcine GALT to produce IFN-o~ or IFN-z in response to stimulation with TGEV. Leukocytes were collected from the MLN and LP, as well as from the peripheral blood, from groups of piglets before and at intervals after infection with virulent TGEV. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of TGEV antigen, and tested for the production of porcine IFN-ce or IFN-r. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was also used as a non-specific inducer of porcine IFN-r. The antibody response to the infection in the donor piglets was measured by a virus neutralization (VN) test. A stock of the Diamond Laboratories vaccine strain of TGEV was prepared by cultivation on monolayers of stable swine testis (SST) cells (McClurkin and Norman, 1966) , which were frozen at -70°C after incubation for 24 h. After thawing, the medium and cells were clarified by centrifugation at 5000 g for 20 min, and the supernatant, containing 107 median cell culture infectious doses per ml as determined by a microtitre infectivity assay on SST cells, was concentrated 15 times using the Minitan ultrafiltration system (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA 01730, USA) with 100 000 mw cutoff filter plates. The concentrated virus was purified as described by on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and the purified virus was used as antigen for the in vitro stimulation of leukocytes. A control antigen was prepared in a similar way from uninfected SST cell cultures. Leukocytes were isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation on Ficoll-paque as described by Cepica and Derbyshire (1984a) , except for the omission of monocyte removal. For the isolation ofMLN leukocytes, the MLN was minced and the tissue forced through a 0.19 mm pore size stainless steel screen. The cells were pelleted and washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and erythrocytes removed by hypotonic lysis. Leukocytes were separated from the LP of the jejunum as described by Ernst et al. ( 1987 ) , by treatment with ethylenediamine tetraacetate followed by dispase, erthryocyte removal by hypotonic lysis, and centrifugation through 30% Percoll. Leukocytes from each of the above sources were finally suspended in RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY 14072-0068, USA) supplemented with 15% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Twelve 2 week-old piglets born to a specific pathogen-free (SPF) Yorkshire sow were used. They were weaned at 10 days of age. They were fed reconstituted evaporated cows' milk (Carnation milk) twice daily, and had continual access to water and to a commercial creep fed for piglets. Three piglets were killed for leukocyte collection at 2 weeks by an intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbitone, at the same time the remaining 9 piglets were infected orally with 2 ml of a 20% suspension of small intestinal mucosa and contents. This was prepared as described by Ristic et al. ( 1965 ) , from a SPF newborn piglet which had been infected 48 h previously with virulent Purdue strain TGEV. Three piglets were killed at 1,2 and 3 weeks post-infection (pi). Food was withheld for 18 h before euthanasia to facilitate the collection of leukocytes from the lamina propria. Leukocyte cultures were prepared in 96-well flat bottom Falcon microtitre plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ 07035, U.S.A. ), with 100/~1 of 106 cells ml-1 in RPMI with 15% FBS in each well. Each of three wells received 100/11 of one of four tenfold dilutions of TGEV or control antigen, from 10-1 to 10-4. Four wells received 100 pl of a solution of PWM (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO 63178-9916) containing 10 #g ml-1. This concentration of PWM had been shown in a preliminary study to be optimal for the stimulation of a lymphocyte proliferative response in porcine leukocytes. A further four control wells were cultured only in RPMI plus 15% FBS. Two identical plates were set up for each source of leukocytes, and the supernatants were collected from one plate after incubation for 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2, and from the second plate after incubation for 5 days. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion when the cultures were initiated, and when the supernatants were harvested after 3 or 5 days. Leukocyte culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity by the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay of Familletti et al. ( 1981 ) , in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The supernatants were tested undiluted, and recorded as positive if they inhibited CPE. For the differentiation of antiviral activity due to porcine IFN-a or IFN-z, the supernatants of positive cultures of leukocytes from the blood, MLN and LP were pooled as follows. Pool number 1 included the leukocyte culture supernatants from the piglets killed at 2 weeks of age and stimulated with PWM, while pools, 2,3 and 4 contained the supernatants from the PWM-stimulated leukocytes from the piglets killed 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection respectively. Pool numbers 5 to 8 consisted of the supernatants from the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen 0,1,2 and 3 weeks after infection respectively. The pH of a portion of each pool was adjusted to 2.0 for 24 h at 4 ° C, and then readjusted to pH 7.0. Each treated and untreated sample was then titrated in the CPE inhibition assay, and the titre was recorded as the reciprocal of the highest dilution which inhibited the CPE. The same supernatant pools were also tested for neutralization of antiviral activity by anti-human IFN-a, which cross reacts with porcine IFN-a (La Bonnardi6re et al., 1986) . Each supernatant pool was mixed with an equal volume of an equine polyclonal anti-human IFN-a antibody (Boehringer Mannheim Canada Ltd., Laval, Qu6bec H7V 3Z9) containing 100 units of antibody, or with normal horse serum, and each mix-ture, together with an untreated control sample, was titrated for antiviral activity in the CPE-inhibition assay as above. Neutralization of the antiviral activity of the porcine IFN was indicated by the presence of CPE. Sera were collected from the piglets before infection, and when their leukocytes were harvested for IFN induction, and tested for TGEV neutralizing antibodies by a microtitre procedure in SST cells with 100 median cell culture infectious doses of the Diamond strain of virus. All the piglets were clinically normal before infection. The nine infected piglets showed clinical signs of TGE within 48 h of inoculation. Vomiting was followed by diarrhoea, which persisted for 2 to 3 days. The piglets remained alert, and since they continued to drink they showed little evidence of dehydration.

The sera were all negative for TGEV neutralizing antibodies before infection. The mean log2 VN antibody titres ( +_ SD) 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection were 9.0 _+ 1.7, 10.6 + 0.6 and 9.3 + 0.6 respectively. Leukocyte viabilities, determined by trypan blue exclusion, are given in Table 1 . The initial viabilities were generally close to 90%. During cultivation, viability was maintained at the highest level by the PBL, and at the low- The effects of treatment at pH 2.0 on the antiviral activities of pooled supernatants from leukocytes collected before or after infection of piglets with TGEV and cultured in the presence of PWM or TGEV antigen est level by the MLN leukocytes. The MLN leukocytes also showed the greatest variability in viability. There were no differences in the viability of leukocytes collected from the piglets before or after infection with TGEV. Antiviral activity was not found in the supernatants of leukocytes cultured in RPMI alone or in the presence of the control antigen. The detection of antiviral activity in the supernatants of leukocyte culture stimulated with PWM or TGEV antigen is summarized in Table 2 . There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Before infection, PWM induced antiviral activity only in MLN leukocytes, but after infection of the donor piglets, leukocytes from all three sources produced antiviral activity in response to PWM, with the peak number of responses in leukocytes collected 2 weeks post-infection. Stimulation of the leukocytes with 10 -I or 10 -2 dilutions of TGEV antigen resulted in a higher number of responses than when 10 -3 or 10 -4 dilutions of the antigen were used. The frequency of responses to the viral antigen was similar before and after infection of the donors with TGEV. The effects of pH 2.0 treatment on the antiviral activity of the pools of supernatants from the leukocyte cultures are shown in Table 3 . The antiviral titres of the supernatants from the cultures stimulated with TGEV were consistently higher than the titres of the PWM-stimulated culture supernatants, and the pH 2.0 treatment had no significant effect on these titres. Conversely, the antiviral activity produced in response to stimulation with PWM was abrogated by treatment of these pooled supernatants at pH 2.0. Treatment of the pooled supernatants with anti-human IFN-a antibodies had no effect on the antiviral titres of pools 1-4, from the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM. However, the antiviral activities of pools 5-8, from the cultures stimulated with TGEV, were completely neutralized by the antihuman IFN-a antibodies. The effects of pH 2.0 treatment and exposure to anti-human IFN-a antibodies on the antiviral activities of the leukocyte culture supernatants provided strong evidence that stimulation with TGEV induced porcine IFN-a, while stimulation with PWM induced porcine IFN-z. It has already been shown that the transmembrane E1 or M glycoprotein of TGEV is a potent inducer of porcine IFN-a (Charley and Laude, 1988 ) , and that porcine IFNz can be induced by T-cell mitogens (Yilma, 1983 ) . The finding that TGEV was able to induce porcine IFN-a in leukocytes from the LP was of interest since it suggests that these cells may be the source of intestinal IFN induced by TGEV in vivo (La Bonnardi6re and Laude, 1981; 1983 ) . Porcine IFN-a induced in the LP would be highly accessible to the cryptal enterocytes, in which it might induce an antiviral state and hence contribute to recovery from the infection. Weingartl and Derbyshire (1991) demonstrated the antiviral activity of porcine IFN-a against TGEV in porcine intestinal explant and intestinal epithelial cell cultures. An indirect antiviral activity of porcine IFN-a induced in the LP might be mediated by activation of NK cells among the intraepithelial lymphocytes, which may contribute to resistance against TGE (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984b) . Conversely, porcine IFN-a induced in LP leukocytes could contribute to the pathogenesis of TGE by reducing the replacement rate of enterocytes, since it is well recognized that IFN may have an antiproliferative effect (Tamm et al., 1987 ) , and Laude and La Bonnadi6re (1984) described a cytocidal effect of porcine IFN-a on porcine renal epithelial cells. There was no evidence that in vitro stimulation with TGEV antigen induced porcine IFN-z in this experiment, since no greater antiviral activity was detected in the culture supematants of leukocytes harvested after infection than before infection of the donor piglets, and the antiviral activity was fully resistant to pH 2.0 treatment and completely neutralized by anti-human IFN-a antibodies. However, the donor piglets mounted a strong immune response as indicated by the appearance of high levels of circulating TGEV antibodies, and studies elsewhere have demonstrated sensitized T-lymphocytes in the LP (Frederick and Bohl, 1976) and MLN (Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979a; of pigs infected with TGEV. It is possible that small amounts of porcine IFN-z in these culture supernatants may have been undetectable in the presence of an excess of porcine IFN-a, or that the latter may have inhibited the proliferative response of sensitized T-lymphocytes upon exposure to antigen which is necessary for IFN-z production. For the induction of porcine IFN-z with TGEV antigen it would be prudent to exclude the highly interferonogenic M glycoprotein of the virus, and use purified S glycoprotein for in vitro stimulation, Our findings demonstrated the ability of GALT lymphocytes to produce porcine IFN-r in response to stimulation with PWM. The titres produced were relatively low, and higher levels might have been induced with phytohaemagglutinin, which is more frequently used for IFN-z induction since it is a more potent T-cell mitogen (Kristensen et al., 1982 ) . We used PWM because we were also attempting to stimulate antibody production in the leukocyte cultures (Naidoo, 1990) , and PWM is mitogenic for B-cells as well as T-cells (Kristensen et al., 1982) . It was of interest that more cultures responded to porcine IFN-z induction with PWM when the leukocytes were harvested from piglets which had been infected with TGEV. The peak responses to PWM were in cultures containing leukocytes harvested 2 weeks post-infection, which corresponded to the peak antibody response to the infection. also found peak blastogenic responses to TGEV antigen with lymphocytes from the blood and MLN harvested between 6 and 14 days after exposure of the donors to virulent virus. In the present study, the increased responsiveness of the leukocytes to PWM after infection may have been due to a relative increase in the number of T-lymphocytes in response to the infection.",
         "Interferon induction in porcine leukocytes with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Leukocytes were harvested from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node and small intestinal lamina propria from groups of three piglets before, and 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) at 2 weeks of age. The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-α or porcine IFN-τ on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-α antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-α was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-τ was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection. This was the first demonstration of IFN induction in vitro in leukocytes from porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissue.. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine enteric coronavirus which causes severe diarrhoea, associated with villous atrophy in the small intestine, and high mortality in newborn piglets (Bohl, 1989) . La Bonnardirre and Laude ( 1981, 1983 ) demonstrated high levels of interferon (IFN) early in experimental TGE in the blood and intestine of newborn piglets, and they suggested that the IFN might have arisen from the enterocytes in the small intestine. In subsequent studies however, La Bonnardirre et al. ( 1986 ) identified the IFN as leukocytic IFN or porcine IFN-ol, but the tissue source of the IFN was not determined. It is well established that porcine IFN-o~ can be induced in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) by a variety of viruses (reviewed by Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1990) and in the case of TGEV it was shown by Charley and Laude ( 1988 ) that IFN induction was associated with an interaction of the viral transmembrane E 1 or M glycoprotein with the PBL cell membrane. In a recent study, Charley and Lavenant (1990) characterized the blood mononuclear cells which produced porcine IFN-a in response to induction with TGEV as non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4 + MHC-class-II-positive cells. Few studies on the induction of porcine IFN-a in leukocytes from sources other than peripheral blood have been described, although Salmon et al. (1989) induced IFN in splenic lymphocytes with influenza virus. In an earlier paper, La Bonnardi~re and Laude (1983) described the production of IFN in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures in response to infection with TGEV. The in vitro induction of porcine IFN-o~ in leukocytes from the gutassociated lymphoid tissue (GALT) has not been described, but immunoreactive IFN-a was found to be widely distributed in normal human tissues, including spindle-shaped cells in the jejunal lamina propria (Khan et al., 1989) . Porcine IFN-z has been less extensively studied than IFN-o~. As in other species, porcine IFN-z is a product of activated T-lymphocytes, and it was first induced by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in PBL by Yilma ( 1983 ) . Subsequently, Piasecki ( 1988 ) showed that porcine IFN-z from the same source exerted a synergistic antiviral action with porcine IFN-o~. studied the antiviral properties of recombinant porcine IFN-z, which was shown to have a protective effect on porcine cells challenged with TGEV, but the recombinant IFN was less protective than natural porcine IFN-o~. The induction of porcine IFN-z in lymphocytes from the GALT has not been described, but there is evidence of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to TGEV in these tissues. The earliest study was by Frederick and Bohl ( 1976 ) , who demonstrated the production of macrophage migration inhibition factor by leukocytes from the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine of pigs infected with TGEV. Blastogenic responses to TGEV antigen were demonstrated in lymphocytes from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) by Shimizu and Shimizu ( 1979a ) , and by , while Shimizu and Shimizu (1979b) showed that cytotoxic lymphocytes were generated in the Peyer's patches and MLN of pigs infected orally with TGEV. The objective of the present study was to determine the ability of leukocytes from the porcine GALT to produce IFN-o~ or IFN-z in response to stimulation with TGEV. Leukocytes were collected from the MLN and LP, as well as from the peripheral blood, from groups of piglets before and at intervals after infection with virulent TGEV. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of TGEV antigen, and tested for the production of porcine IFN-ce or IFN-r. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was also used as a non-specific inducer of porcine IFN-r. The antibody response to the infection in the donor piglets was measured by a virus neutralization (VN) test. A stock of the Diamond Laboratories vaccine strain of TGEV was prepared by cultivation on monolayers of stable swine testis (SST) cells (McClurkin and Norman, 1966) , which were frozen at -70°C after incubation for 24 h. After thawing, the medium and cells were clarified by centrifugation at 5000 g for 20 min, and the supernatant, containing 107 median cell culture infectious doses per ml as determined by a microtitre infectivity assay on SST cells, was concentrated 15 times using the Minitan ultrafiltration system (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA 01730, USA) with 100 000 mw cutoff filter plates. The concentrated virus was purified as described by on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and the purified virus was used as antigen for the in vitro stimulation of leukocytes. A control antigen was prepared in a similar way from uninfected SST cell cultures. Leukocytes were isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation on Ficoll-paque as described by Cepica and Derbyshire (1984a) , except for the omission of monocyte removal. For the isolation ofMLN leukocytes, the MLN was minced and the tissue forced through a 0.19 mm pore size stainless steel screen. The cells were pelleted and washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and erythrocytes removed by hypotonic lysis. Leukocytes were separated from the LP of the jejunum as described by Ernst et al. ( 1987 ) , by treatment with ethylenediamine tetraacetate followed by dispase, erthryocyte removal by hypotonic lysis, and centrifugation through 30% Percoll. Leukocytes from each of the above sources were finally suspended in RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY 14072-0068, USA) supplemented with 15% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Twelve 2 week-old piglets born to a specific pathogen-free (SPF) Yorkshire sow were used. They were weaned at 10 days of age. They were fed reconstituted evaporated cows' milk (Carnation milk) twice daily, and had continual access to water and to a commercial creep fed for piglets. Three piglets were killed for leukocyte collection at 2 weeks by an intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbitone, at the same time the remaining 9 piglets were infected orally with 2 ml of a 20% suspension of small intestinal mucosa and contents. This was prepared as described by Ristic et al. ( 1965 ) , from a SPF newborn piglet which had been infected 48 h previously with virulent Purdue strain TGEV. Three piglets were killed at 1,2 and 3 weeks post-infection (pi). Food was withheld for 18 h before euthanasia to facilitate the collection of leukocytes from the lamina propria. Leukocyte cultures were prepared in 96-well flat bottom Falcon microtitre plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ 07035, U.S.A. ), with 100/~1 of 106 cells ml-1 in RPMI with 15% FBS in each well. Each of three wells received 100/11 of one of four tenfold dilutions of TGEV or control antigen, from 10-1 to 10-4. Four wells received 100 pl of a solution of PWM (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO 63178-9916) containing 10 #g ml-1. This concentration of PWM had been shown in a preliminary study to be optimal for the stimulation of a lymphocyte proliferative response in porcine leukocytes. A further four control wells were cultured only in RPMI plus 15% FBS. Two identical plates were set up for each source of leukocytes, and the supernatants were collected from one plate after incubation for 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2, and from the second plate after incubation for 5 days. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion when the cultures were initiated, and when the supernatants were harvested after 3 or 5 days. Leukocyte culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity by the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay of Familletti et al. ( 1981 ) , in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The supernatants were tested undiluted, and recorded as positive if they inhibited CPE. For the differentiation of antiviral activity due to porcine IFN-a or IFN-z, the supernatants of positive cultures of leukocytes from the blood, MLN and LP were pooled as follows. Pool number 1 included the leukocyte culture supernatants from the piglets killed at 2 weeks of age and stimulated with PWM, while pools, 2,3 and 4 contained the supernatants from the PWM-stimulated leukocytes from the piglets killed 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection respectively. Pool numbers 5 to 8 consisted of the supernatants from the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen 0,1,2 and 3 weeks after infection respectively. The pH of a portion of each pool was adjusted to 2.0 for 24 h at 4 ° C, and then readjusted to pH 7.0. Each treated and untreated sample was then titrated in the CPE inhibition assay, and the titre was recorded as the reciprocal of the highest dilution which inhibited the CPE. The same supernatant pools were also tested for neutralization of antiviral activity by anti-human IFN-a, which cross reacts with porcine IFN-a (La Bonnardi6re et al., 1986) . Each supernatant pool was mixed with an equal volume of an equine polyclonal anti-human IFN-a antibody (Boehringer Mannheim Canada Ltd., Laval, Qu6bec H7V 3Z9) containing 100 units of antibody, or with normal horse serum, and each mix-ture, together with an untreated control sample, was titrated for antiviral activity in the CPE-inhibition assay as above. Neutralization of the antiviral activity of the porcine IFN was indicated by the presence of CPE. Sera were collected from the piglets before infection, and when their leukocytes were harvested for IFN induction, and tested for TGEV neutralizing antibodies by a microtitre procedure in SST cells with 100 median cell culture infectious doses of the Diamond strain of virus. All the piglets were clinically normal before infection. The nine infected piglets showed clinical signs of TGE within 48 h of inoculation. Vomiting was followed by diarrhoea, which persisted for 2 to 3 days. The piglets remained alert, and since they continued to drink they showed little evidence of dehydration.

The MLN leukocytes also showed the greatest variability in viability. There were no differences in the viability of leukocytes collected from the piglets before or after infection with TGEV. Antiviral activity was not found in the supernatants of leukocytes cultured in RPMI alone or in the presence of the control antigen. The detection of antiviral activity in the supernatants of leukocyte culture stimulated with PWM or TGEV antigen is summarized in Table 2 . There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Before infection, PWM induced antiviral activity only in MLN leukocytes, but after infection of the donor piglets, leukocytes from all three sources produced antiviral activity in response to PWM, with the peak number of responses in leukocytes collected 2 weeks post-infection. Stimulation of the leukocytes with 10 -I or 10 -2 dilutions of TGEV antigen resulted in a higher number of responses than when 10 -3 or 10 -4 dilutions of the antigen were used. The frequency of responses to the viral antigen was similar before and after infection of the donors with TGEV. The effects of pH 2.0 treatment on the antiviral activity of the pools of supernatants from the leukocyte cultures are shown in Table 3 . The antiviral titres of the supernatants from the cultures stimulated with TGEV were consistently higher than the titres of the PWM-stimulated culture supernatants, and the pH 2.0 treatment had no significant effect on these titres. Conversely, the antiviral activity produced in response to stimulation with PWM was abrogated by treatment of these pooled supernatants at pH 2.0. Treatment of the pooled supernatants with anti-human IFN-a antibodies had no effect on the antiviral titres of pools 1-4, from the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM. However, the antiviral activities of pools 5-8, from the cultures stimulated with TGEV, were completely neutralized by the antihuman IFN-a antibodies. The effects of pH 2.0 treatment and exposure to anti-human IFN-a antibodies on the antiviral activities of the leukocyte culture supernatants provided strong evidence that stimulation with TGEV induced porcine IFN-a, while stimulation with PWM induced porcine IFN-z. It has already been shown that the transmembrane E1 or M glycoprotein of TGEV is a potent inducer of porcine IFN-a (Charley and Laude, 1988 ) , and that porcine IFNz can be induced by T-cell mitogens (Yilma, 1983 ) . The finding that TGEV was able to induce porcine IFN-a in leukocytes from the LP was of interest since it suggests that these cells may be the source of intestinal IFN induced by TGEV in vivo (La Bonnardi6re and Laude, 1981; 1983 ) . Porcine IFN-a induced in the LP would be highly accessible to the cryptal enterocytes, in which it might induce an antiviral state and hence contribute to recovery from the infection. Weingartl and Derbyshire (1991) demonstrated the antiviral activity of porcine IFN-a against TGEV in porcine intestinal explant and intestinal epithelial cell cultures. An indirect antiviral activity of porcine IFN-a induced in the LP might be mediated by activation of NK cells among the intraepithelial lymphocytes, which may contribute to resistance against TGE (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984b) . Conversely, porcine IFN-a induced in LP leukocytes could contribute to the pathogenesis of TGE by reducing the replacement rate of enterocytes, since it is well recognized that IFN may have an antiproliferative effect (Tamm et al., 1987 ) , and Laude and La Bonnadi6re (1984) described a cytocidal effect of porcine IFN-a on porcine renal epithelial cells. There was no evidence that in vitro stimulation with TGEV antigen induced porcine IFN-z in this experiment, since no greater antiviral activity was detected in the culture supematants of leukocytes harvested after infection than before infection of the donor piglets, and the antiviral activity was fully resistant to pH 2.0 treatment and completely neutralized by anti-human IFN-a antibodies.

For the induction of porcine IFN-z with TGEV antigen it would be prudent to exclude the highly interferonogenic M glycoprotein of the virus, and use purified S glycoprotein for in vitro stimulation, Our findings demonstrated the ability of GALT lymphocytes to produce porcine IFN-r in response to stimulation with PWM. The titres produced were relatively low, and higher levels might have been induced with phytohaemagglutinin, which is more frequently used for IFN-z induction since it is a more potent T-cell mitogen (Kristensen et al., 1982 ) .

It was of interest that more cultures responded to porcine IFN-z induction with PWM when the leukocytes were harvested from piglets which had been infected with TGEV. The peak responses to PWM were in cultures containing leukocytes harvested 2 weeks post-infection, which corresponded to the peak antibody response to the infection. also found peak blastogenic responses to TGEV antigen with lymphocytes from the blood and MLN harvested between 6 and 14 days after exposure of the donors to virulent virus. In the present study, the increased responsiveness of the leukocytes to PWM after infection may have been due to a relative increase in the number of T-lymphocytes in response to the infection.",

         "Influence of experimentally induced endogenous production of cortisol on the immune capacity in swine",
         "Field studies have suggested that ‘stressors’, such as transportation and mixing, might interfere with the immune competence of pigs. Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.",

         "Modem swine management often includes the transfer of piglets from several producers to fattening units. In such newly established herds, there is a rapid spread of infections among the animals. Signs of reduced immune functions are also seen 1 week after allocation, possibly owing to stress of animals during transportation, mixing and establishment of new ranking orders (Artursson et al., 1989; Wallgren et at., 1993 ) . Such an immunosuppression, coinciding in time with exposure to new micro-organisms, would be expected to increase susceptibility of the pigs to infections. The most extensively studied mediators of stress-induced immunosuppression are the glucocorticoids (for overview, see Cohen, 1992) . The effects of elevated concentrations ofcortisol are evident in vivo as neutrophilia and lymphopenia, a result of redistribution of leukocytes. In the mouse, apoptosis of immature thymocytes also contributes to the lymphopenia (Ucker, 1987) . The function of immunocompetent cells under the influence of corticosteroids has been studied mainly in vitro, either by addition of the steroid to cell cultures or by assessing reactivities of mononuclear cells purified from the blood of individuals treated with corticosteroids. Depending on method, contradictory results are obtained for some functional tests such as the in vitro production of antibodies, reviewed by Dupont (1988) . There is, however, no doubt that the mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is suppressed by corticosteroids. For example, Blecha and Baker (1986) demonstrated that cortisol, both in vitro and in vivo, reduced the proliferation of bovine PBMC, probably a result of suppressed production ofinterleukin-2 (IL-2). The suppressed IL-2 pro-duction is most likely to be a result of the interference of glucocorticosteroids with the transcription of genes coding for cytokines (Northrop et al., 1992) , as has also been shown for other immunoregulatory proteins (Helmberg et al., 1990) . However, the response to stressors shows considerable inter-species differences, and swine are regarded as corticosteroid resistant, as reviewed by Griffin ( 1989 ) . In the present study, we therefore established a model to study the effect of corticosteroids in vivo on the function of porcine PBMC in vitro. High, but physiological, concentrations of corticosteroids were induced by treating pigs with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at a second immunization with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. The tests of PBMC functions were performed both with purified PBMC and in whole blood cultures, attempting to mirror more closely the in vivo situation. Since approximately 90% of the Swedish fattening pigs are affected by infections with M. hyopneumoniae (WaUgren et al., 1993 ) , we studied the effect of ACTH treatments on the antibody response in vitro to that antigen. We also measured in vitro mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production, as well as the ability of PBMC to produce interferon-a (IFN-a) after exposure to pseudorabies virus (PRV). Eighteen specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs (Serogrisen, Ransta, Sweden), nine gilts and nine barrows, from four litters were included in the study. After arrival at the Animal Department at the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden, three experimental groups (A, B and C) were formed and the pigs were accustomed to each other for 4 weeks. To reduce the effect of litter origin, each experimental group consisted of six pigs from diverse litters (one gilt and one barrow from sow 1 and sow 2, respectively, one gilt from sow 3 and one barrow from sow 4). The pigs were 4 months old when the experiment began. Blood samples were collected by jugular vein puncture using evacuated glass tubes (B-D vacutainer, Becton-Dickinson, Meylan Cedex, France) without a~ ditive or with heparin ( 143 USP units) or EDTA (0.12 ml 0.34 M ) as additive. Blood samples were collected from all animals at 09: 00 h on 0, 7, 14, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37, 42, and 49 . Day 0 was the day on which the first immunization was administered. On Days 0 and 28, the blood samples were collected before the immunizations. All pigs were immunized twice intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1.5 ml M. hyopneumoniae antigen ( 1.0 mg protein ml-t ), mixed with an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Day 0) or with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Day 28 ). Pigs in Groups A and B were treated with porcine ACTH (Acton prolongatum; Ferring, Lund, Sweden ). The treatment with 60 IU ACTH per 100 kg body weight was carried out twice daily (at 06:00 h and 16:00 h). Pigs in Group A were treated with ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae, i.e. from Day 21 (evening) until Day 35 (morning). Pigs in Group B were only treated with ACTH during the week after the second immunization, i.e. from Day 28 (evening) until Day 35 (morning). Pigs in Group C were not treated with ACTH at all. Blood was collected with EDTA, and the total number of leukocytes determined by counting in a microcell counter (Sysmex F-800, Toa Medical Electronics Co., Kobe, Japan). Differential leukocyte counts were made on blood smears stained with Giemsa's and May Griinewald's solutions. The concentrations ot cortisol were determined in plasma by a standard radioimmunoassay validated for pigs (Nyberg, 1988) . These analyses were performed according to standard procedures at the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The concentration of PBMC was adjusted to 4 × 106 cells ml-~ growth medium, i.e. RPMI 1640 medium with 20 mM HEPES buffer, supplemented with glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (200 IU ml-t ), streptomycin ( 100/~g ml-~ ), 50/zM 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% FCS (Myoclone; Gibco, Paisley, UK). The proliferation and IL-2 production induced by concanavalin A (Con A; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden; 5 /tg ml -t), phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Wellcome, Dartford, UK; 1/tg ml-~ ) or PWM ( 10/~g ml-t; pokeweed mitogen, Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) was determined in cultures of purified PBMC (4 × 10 6 cells ml -j ) or in whole blood cultures ( 100/d heparinized blood diluted l:15 in growth medium) as described earlier (Magnusson and Fossum, 1992) . The proliferation is expressed as mean counts per minute (cpm) value for quadruplicate cultures, while the IL-2 activity is expressed as percentage of a laboratory standard according to Edfors-Lilja et al. ( 1991 ) . Glutaraldehyde-fixed, PRY-infected, porcine kidney (PK-15 ) cells were used for induction of IFN-~ production as described in detail by Artursson et al. (1989) . Either 4 × 105 PBMC in 200 al growth medium or heparinized blood diluted 1 : 15 in growth medium were added to quadruplicate wells containing PRV-infected PK-I 5 cells and to duplicate control wells containing uninfected PK-I 5 cells. The supernatants were collected after 18 h at 37°C, and stored at -20 o C until analysed. The concentrations of IFN-a in the supernatants, as well as in serum samples, were measured by an immunoassay (Diaz de Arce et al., 1992) , further modified to utilize the principle of time-resolved fluorometry (delayed fluoroimmunoassay; DELFIA) with Europium lanthanide as label (Artursson, 1993 ) . Three preparations ofM. hyopneumoniae strain V 27 antigen were used. Whole M. hyopneumoniae was cultured in Friis broth with 10% SPF swine serum (National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden) and mixed with adjuvant for immunization, a Tween 20 treated preparation for detection of serum antibodies and a sonicated whole cell antigen preparation for induction of antibody production in vitro and for detection of these antibodies. All antigen preparations were kindly provided by Dr G. B61ske, the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden and are described in detail by B61ske et al. ( 1987, 1990 ). The in vitro production of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae was determined as previously described in detail by Wallgren et al. ( 1992 ) . In brief, 4 × 105 PBMC in 200 pl volumes of growth medium containing 2.5 ng PWM ml-~ were added to quadruplicate wells of microtiter plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA, USA ) coated with M. hyopneumoniae antigen. After 4 days at 37°C in a humid atmosphere with 7% COz in air, 150/~l of the culture supernatants was collected. The PBMC were discarded and the plate was washed three times in PBS with 0.05% Tween. The amount of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae bound in the induction plate as well as the amount of antibodies bound to M. hyopneumoniae in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The optical density (A450) of medium controls was subtracted from the sample values and the mean optical density for the culture supernatants was added to that for the corresponding stimulated wells. This figure is used as a measure of the ability to produce antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in vitro. Serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae were detected by the ELISA initially described by B61ske et al. (1990) and further modified by Wallgren et al. ( 1992 ) . The quantities of serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae are expressed as log~o ELISA titres calculated from ten-fold serial dilutions of the sera. In both ELISA systems, positive and negative control sera were included and the measured absorbance values of samples were corrected to a standard value equal to 0.9 absorbance units for the positive control serum. The method of Magnusson and Fossum (1992) was used to estimate the polyclonally induced production of Ig in vitro. Briefly, 4 X 10 s PBMC were cultured in 200 #1 growth medium containing 0.25 ng PWM ml-1. After 72 h, 100/~1 supernatant was collected and the concentration of Ig was determined by an indi-rect ELISA for porcine Ig. Two step titrations of the samples were performed in duplicate wells. As negative and positive references, growth medium and known amounts of purified swine IgG, respectively, were included. The mean concentration of Ig produced (ng ml -I ) was calculated from a standard preparation ot porcine Ig using an universal assay calculator program (Assay Zap; Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The significance of difference between means of a group at various sampling occasions was tested by the paired Student's t-test, Stat View 512 (Version 1.0, Abacus Concepts, Calabasas, CA ). Effects of litter and sex on the ability to produce antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in vitro were tested with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Utest, Stat View 512 (Version 1.0, Abacus Concepts, Calabasas, CA, USA ). Differences between experimental groups were tested by an aligned rank test (Lehmann, 1975) , blocking for sex and litter origin, and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. In a recent study (Edfors-Lilja et al., 1993 ) , various degrees of heritability and/ or litter effects were demonstrated for several immune parameters in swine, including total and differential white blood cell counts, mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production and IFN-a production. Similarily, clearcut influence of litter, as well as the influence of sex, was found on the ability to produce antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in vitro. As exemplified by the results of Day 21 (i.e. 3 weeks after the first immunization, but before initiation of the treatment with ACTH), significant differences (P<0.05) were obtained despite the low number of individuals (Fig. 1 ) . Consequently, data for all immune parameters were blocked for effect of litter and sex when comparing experimental groups. The concentrations of cortisol in plasma are shown in Fig. 2 as mean values (nmol l-~ plasma) for the three groups of animals. Already at the first sampling, during the period of treatment with ACTH (43 h after initiating the treatment), the concentrations of cortisol were significantly increased (Group A: Day 23 compared with Day 21, P<0.05; Group B: Day 30 compared with Day 28, P< 0.01 ). The cortisol concentrations remained elevated throughout the period of ACTH treatment, but dropped below the normal level when the treatment was terminated (Day 37 ). Thereafter, the plasma concentrations of cortisol returned to normal levels. Significant differences between groups are shown in Fig. 2.  The number of lymphocytes (Fig. 3 (A) ) decreased significantly in blood obtained from the ACTH-treated animals, simultaneously with the increase in Shaded areas indicate periods when ACTH was not administered to any of the compared groups. The number of neutrophilic granulocytes (Fig. 3 (B) ) increased during the ACTH treatment. At all sampling occasions during this period, the neutrophil numbers were significantly higher in blood from the ACTH-treated pigs than in blood from the control pigs. For all animals, including the control animals, a marked increase (P< 0.01 ) in the total number of neutrophilic granulocytes was found 2 days after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae (Day 30 ). Fig. 4 to PHA and Con A were significantly suppressed in the whole blood cultures at all sampling occasions during ACTH treatment. Although significant, the suppression of the PWM-induced proliferation during the ACTH treatment was less evident. The ability to produce IL-2 in response to mitogen stimulation was assessed in whole blood cultures (Fig. 5 ) and in cultures of purified PBMC (results not shown). Clear suppressive effects of the ACTH treatment were seen, but only in whole blood cultures, and only with the mitogens PHA and Con A. In contrast, no inhibitory effects were noted in the cultures of purified PBMC.  No pig displayed detectable concentrations of IFN-ot (i.e. less than one unit ml-t ) in serum at any sampling occasion. A marked increase in the IFN-a producing capacity was observed after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae, both in cultures of purified PBMC and in whole blood cultures (Fig. 6) . In ACTH-treated pigs, this increase was evident earlier in cultures of purified PBMC, i.e. 2 days after the second immu- nization (Day 30), than in whole blood cultures (Day 37 ). With purified PBMC of the control pigs, the increased ability to produce IFN-t~ was not seen until Day 35, the same day as in cultures of whole blood obtained from these pigs. Comparison of the treatment groups during the ACTH treatment demonstrated that, when assessed in whole blood cultures, pigs in the control group (Group C) produced significantly more (P< 0.05) IFN-~ than ACTH-treated pigs (Group A) prior to the second immunization. Furthermore, pigs in Group C produced significantly more (P<0.01) IFN-cz than pigs in both Groups A and B at Day 35. The difference between Groups C and A remained significant (P< 0.01 ) throughout the experimental period. However, when assessed in cultures of purified PBMC, the ability to produce IFN-ot was lower among control pigs (Group C) than among ACTH-treated pigs (Groups A and B ) immediately after the second immunization. C=4.47+_0.28). A further increase in antibody titres was seen after the second immunization, reaching peak values on Day 37 (logto titre: A=4. 43_+0.32; B = 4.29 _ 0.26; C = 4.47 _ 0.28 ) . No significant differences between the experimental groups were found for the accumulated levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in serum. As illustrated in Fig. 7(A) , the quantities of antibodies produced in vitro at stimulation with M. hyopneumoniae antigen increased continuously until Day 25 for PBMC obtained from the non-treated pigs (Groups B and C). This increase was retarded for PBMC obtained from ACTH-treated pigs (Group A) and was significantly lower (P<0.05) at Days 23 and 25 for the ACTH-treated pigs than for the non-treated pigs (Groups B plus C). The response to the first immunization also decreased to a significantly lower level (P<0.01; Day 30) for animals in Group A than for those in Groups B and C, respectively. After the second immunization (Days 32 and 35), isolated PBMC of all pigs became increasingly able to produce specific antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae (Fig. 7 (B) ) and thereafter (at Days 37 to 49) decreased. During this period, no differences were noted between the experimental groups. The ability to produce Ig at stimulation with a sub-mitogenic dose of PWM was tested with purified PBMC. The Ig production of PBMC from the various pigs ranged from 0.04 to 0.61 ng mi-~ culture medium during the experimental period, but no significant effects of treatment with ACTH in vivo were observed (results not shown ). A model to study the effect of experimentally induced stress was established in swine. Daily treatments with ACTH elevated the endogenous production of cortisol to levels corresponding to those elicited in pigs by restricted ability to move, electric pulsation or heat stress (Becker et al., 1985 ) . By this 'stress model', cortisol was found to influence the T-cell-dependent antibody production of PBMC to M. hyopneumoniae, but not the T-cell independent, polyclonally induced immunoglobulin production. Further, both the proliferation and IL-2 production were suppressed by cortisol when induced by the T-cell mitogens PHA and Con A, but not by PWM, which is believed to act both on T and B lymphocytes (Sharon, 1983) . Therefore, it seems likely that cortisol, also in swine, interferes with the production of IL-2 as described earlier for human (Bettens et al., 1984) and bovine (Blecha and Baker, 1986) cells. As genetic differences have been previously described for several immune parameters (Edfors-Lilja et al., 1991 , 1993 , pigs from four litters were alloted to the experimental groups to eliminate these differences. This procedure increased the individual variation within the groups, but made it possible to use a statistical method blocking for the effect of sex and litter origin when analysing data. The ACTH-induced neutrophilia and lymphopenia resemble the alterations in differential white blood cell counts, normally achieved by sustained elevation of cortisol levels (Quinn, 1990) . Two days after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae, the highest neutrophil numbers were recorded for all pigs, including those in the control group. Consequently, both the ACTH treatment and the immunization could be mirrored in the differential white blood cell counts. The proliferation and IL-2 production in response to mitogen stimulation were tested both in whole blood cultures and in cultures of purified PBMC. In accordance with earlier studies on oestradiol (Magnusson and Fossum, 1992 ) , the most pronounced effects were found in the whole blood cultures stimulated with PHA or Con A. As hormones are known to alter the number of blood lymphocytes, this has to be considered when functional tests are carried out in whole blood cultures. In the previous study on oestradiol, no significant correlation between cpm values and the total number of PBMC per milliliter of blood in the samples was found. Further, no significant effects of cell concentration were seen on the magnitude of proliferation in a pilot study where whole blood from four pigs was serial diluted and stimulated with PHA (mean cpm values_+ SD in blood diluted 1:10; 16332_+9631, 1:15; 12 150+_4170, 1:20; 10529_+7412, 1:25; 11 363 _+ 8542). Further, the responses to stimulation with PWM (proliferation and IL-2 production) were not severely affected, despite the variation in the number of PBMC per unit blood. Therefore, it is most likely that the glucocorticoid not only reduced the number of mononuclear cells in the blood circulation but also affected their responsiveness to stimulation with the T-cell mitogens PHA and Con A. In accordance with Nowacki et al. ( 1993 ) , who described a transient increase of porcine natural-interferon-producing (NIP) cell frequency in connection with vaccination, an increase in the IFN-a-producing capacity was found after the second immunization for all animals. When analysed in whole blood cultures, this increase in IFN-a-producing capacity was not as high for pigs treated for 2 weeks with ACTH as for pigs in the other two experimental groups. In contrast, when analysed in cultures of purified PBMC, the increase in the IFN-c~-producing capacity was more pronounced for ACTH-treated pigs than for non-treated pigs. One explanation for these discrepancies could be that the negative influence of cortisol seen in whole blood cultures is reduced when the PBMC are purified and cultured in medium free from cortisol. However, this is probably not the only explanation, as purified PBMC obtained from the ACTH treated pigs produced approximately twice the amount of IFN-a as PBMC obtained from the control pigs did. For example, if the number of a very efficient but rare circulating cell population, such as the porcine NIP-cell (one per 1000 PBMC), is unaltered despite the occurrence of lymphopenia, an enrichment of NIP cells in cultures with a fixed number of purified PBMC could account for the relatively higher amounts of IFN-a produced. In this context, it is notable that enrichment of porcine IFNproducing leukocytes increases the IFN yield per cell (Nowacki and Charley, 1993) . Despite this, a lower amount of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae was produced in vitro at Days 23 and 25 and the time to reach the peak response to the primary immunization was delayed in the ACTH-treated animals, no differences between the groups were seen in their in vitro or in vivo responses to the second immunization. These results agree with those of Oldham and Bridger (1992) , who demonstrated that the time at which dexamethasone (DX) was administered to calves in relation to rotavirus infection was decisive as to the effect it had on their antibody production. When DX treatment started after primary, but before secondary, infection the systemic and local responses were not affected while they were inhibited when the DX treatment commenced prior to the primary infection. In the latter case, the clinical signs of disease were also greater. Consequently, the present experimental results suggest that 'stressors' that elicit an increased production of cortisol may interfere with the immune capacity of swine. This can be of clinical importance when pigs are exposed to new micro-organisms and external stressors simultaneously, e.g. when mixed and transported to new environments.",
         "Influence of experimentally induced endogenous production of cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Field studies have suggested that ‘stressors’, such as transportation and mixing, might interfere with the immune competence of pigs. Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.. Modem swine management often includes the transfer of piglets from several producers to fattening units. In such newly established herds, there is a rapid spread of infections among the animals. Signs of reduced immune functions are also seen 1 week after allocation, possibly owing to stress of animals during transportation, mixing and establishment of new ranking orders (Artursson et al., 1989; Wallgren et at., 1993 ) . Such an immunosuppression, coinciding in time with exposure to new micro-organisms, would be expected to increase susceptibility of the pigs to infections. The most extensively studied mediators of stress-induced immunosuppression are the glucocorticoids (for overview, see Cohen, 1992) . The effects of elevated concentrations ofcortisol are evident in vivo as neutrophilia and lymphopenia, a result of redistribution of leukocytes. In the mouse, apoptosis of immature thymocytes also contributes to the lymphopenia (Ucker, 1987) . The function of immunocompetent cells under the influence of corticosteroids has been studied mainly in vitro, either by addition of the steroid to cell cultures or by assessing reactivities of mononuclear cells purified from the blood of individuals treated with corticosteroids. Depending on method, contradictory results are obtained for some functional tests such as the in vitro production of antibodies, reviewed by Dupont (1988) . There is, however, no doubt that the mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is suppressed by corticosteroids. For example, Blecha and Baker (1986) demonstrated that cortisol, both in vitro and in vivo, reduced the proliferation of bovine PBMC, probably a result of suppressed production ofinterleukin-2 (IL-2). The suppressed IL-2 pro-duction is most likely to be a result of the interference of glucocorticosteroids with the transcription of genes coding for cytokines (Northrop et al., 1992) , as has also been shown for other immunoregulatory proteins (Helmberg et al., 1990) . However, the response to stressors shows considerable inter-species differences, and swine are regarded as corticosteroid resistant, as reviewed by Griffin ( 1989 ) . In the present study, we therefore established a model to study the effect of corticosteroids in vivo on the function of porcine PBMC in vitro. High, but physiological, concentrations of corticosteroids were induced by treating pigs with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at a second immunization with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. The tests of PBMC functions were performed both with purified PBMC and in whole blood cultures, attempting to mirror more closely the in vivo situation. Since approximately 90% of the Swedish fattening pigs are affected by infections with M. hyopneumoniae (WaUgren et al., 1993 ) , we studied the effect of ACTH treatments on the antibody response in vitro to that antigen. We also measured in vitro mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production, as well as the ability of PBMC to produce interferon-a (IFN-a) after exposure to pseudorabies virus (PRV). Eighteen specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs (Serogrisen, Ransta, Sweden), nine gilts and nine barrows, from four litters were included in the study. After arrival at the Animal Department at the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden, three experimental groups (A, B and C) were formed and the pigs were accustomed to each other for 4 weeks. To reduce the effect of litter origin, each experimental group consisted of six pigs from diverse litters (one gilt and one barrow from sow 1 and sow 2, respectively, one gilt from sow 3 and one barrow from sow 4). The pigs were 4 months old when the experiment began. Blood samples were collected by jugular vein puncture using evacuated glass tubes (B-D vacutainer, Becton-Dickinson, Meylan Cedex, France) without a~ ditive or with heparin ( 143 USP units) or EDTA (0.12 ml 0.34 M ) as additive. Blood samples were collected from all animals at 09: 00 h on 0, 7, 14, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37, 42, and 49 . Day 0 was the day on which the first immunization was administered. On Days 0 and 28, the blood samples were collected before the immunizations. All pigs were immunized twice intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1.5 ml M. hyopneumoniae antigen ( 1.0 mg protein ml-t ), mixed with an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Day 0) or with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Day 28 ). Pigs in Groups A and B were treated with porcine ACTH (Acton prolongatum; Ferring, Lund, Sweden ). The treatment with 60 IU ACTH per 100 kg body weight was carried out twice daily (at 06:00 h and 16:00 h). Pigs in Group A were treated with ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae, i.e. from Day 21 (evening) until Day 35 (morning). Pigs in Group B were only treated with ACTH during the week after the second immunization, i.e. from Day 28 (evening) until Day 35 (morning). Pigs in Group C were not treated with ACTH at all. Blood was collected with EDTA, and the total number of leukocytes determined by counting in a microcell counter (Sysmex F-800, Toa Medical Electronics Co., Kobe, Japan). Differential leukocyte counts were made on blood smears stained with Giemsa's and May Griinewald's solutions. The concentrations ot cortisol were determined in plasma by a standard radioimmunoassay validated for pigs (Nyberg, 1988) . These analyses were performed according to standard procedures at the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The concentration of PBMC was adjusted to 4 × 106 cells ml-~ growth medium, i.e. RPMI 1640 medium with 20 mM HEPES buffer, supplemented with glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (200 IU ml-t ), streptomycin ( 100/~g ml-~ ), 50/zM 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% FCS (Myoclone; Gibco, Paisley, UK). The proliferation and IL-2 production induced by concanavalin A (Con A; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden; 5 /tg ml -t), phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Wellcome, Dartford, UK; 1/tg ml-~ ) or PWM ( 10/~g ml-t; pokeweed mitogen, Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) was determined in cultures of purified PBMC (4 × 10 6 cells ml -j ) or in whole blood cultures ( 100/d heparinized blood diluted l:15 in growth medium) as described earlier (Magnusson and Fossum, 1992) . The proliferation is expressed as mean counts per minute (cpm) value for quadruplicate cultures, while the IL-2 activity is expressed as percentage of a laboratory standard according to Edfors-Lilja et al. ( 1991 ) . Glutaraldehyde-fixed, PRY-infected, porcine kidney (PK-15 ) cells were used for induction of IFN-~ production as described in detail by Artursson et al. (1989) . Either 4 × 105 PBMC in 200 al growth medium or heparinized blood diluted 1 : 15 in growth medium were added to quadruplicate wells containing PRV-infected PK-I 5 cells and to duplicate control wells containing uninfected PK-I 5 cells. The supernatants were collected after 18 h at 37°C, and stored at -20 o C until analysed. The concentrations of IFN-a in the supernatants, as well as in serum samples, were measured by an immunoassay (Diaz de Arce et al., 1992) , further modified to utilize the principle of time-resolved fluorometry (delayed fluoroimmunoassay; DELFIA) with Europium lanthanide as label (Artursson, 1993 ) . Three preparations ofM. hyopneumoniae strain V 27 antigen were used. Whole M. hyopneumoniae was cultured in Friis broth with 10% SPF swine serum (National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden) and mixed with adjuvant for immunization, a Tween 20 treated preparation for detection of serum antibodies and a sonicated whole cell antigen preparation for induction of antibody production in vitro and for detection of these antibodies. All antigen preparations were kindly provided by Dr G. B61ske, the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden and are described in detail by B61ske et al. ( 1987, 1990 ). The in vitro production of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae was determined as previously described in detail by Wallgren et al. ( 1992 ) . In brief, 4 × 105 PBMC in 200 pl volumes of growth medium containing 2.5 ng PWM ml-~ were added to quadruplicate wells of microtiter plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA, USA ) coated with M. hyopneumoniae antigen. After 4 days at 37°C in a humid atmosphere with 7% COz in air, 150/~l of the culture supernatants was collected. The PBMC were discarded and the plate was washed three times in PBS with 0.05% Tween. The amount of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae bound in the induction plate as well as the amount of antibodies bound to M. hyopneumoniae in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The optical density (A450) of medium controls was subtracted from the sample values and the mean optical density for the culture supernatants was added to that for the corresponding stimulated wells. This figure is used as a measure of the ability to produce antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in vitro. Serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae were detected by the ELISA initially described by B61ske et al. (1990) and further modified by Wallgren et al. ( 1992 ) . The quantities of serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae are expressed as log~o ELISA titres calculated from ten-fold serial dilutions of the sera. In both ELISA systems, positive and negative control sera were included and the measured absorbance values of samples were corrected to a standard value equal to 0.9 absorbance units for the positive control serum. The method of Magnusson and Fossum (1992) was used to estimate the polyclonally induced production of Ig in vitro. Briefly, 4 X 10 s PBMC were cultured in 200 #1 growth medium containing 0.25 ng PWM ml-1. After 72 h, 100/~1 supernatant was collected and the concentration of Ig was determined by an indi-rect ELISA for porcine Ig. Two step titrations of the samples were performed in duplicate wells. As negative and positive references, growth medium and known amounts of purified swine IgG, respectively, were included. The mean concentration of Ig produced (ng ml -I ) was calculated from a standard preparation ot porcine Ig using an universal assay calculator program (Assay Zap; Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The significance of difference between means of a group at various sampling occasions was tested by the paired Student's t-test, Stat View 512 (Version 1.0, Abacus Concepts, Calabasas, CA ). Effects of litter and sex on the ability to produce antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in vitro were tested with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Utest, Stat View 512 (Version 1.0, Abacus Concepts, Calabasas, CA, USA ). Differences between experimental groups were tested by an aligned rank test (Lehmann, 1975) , blocking for sex and litter origin, and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. In a recent study (Edfors-Lilja et al., 1993 ) , various degrees of heritability and/ or litter effects were demonstrated for several immune parameters in swine, including total and differential white blood cell counts, mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production and IFN-a production. Similarily, clearcut influence of litter, as well as the influence of sex, was found on the ability to produce antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in vitro. As exemplified by the results of Day 21 (i.e. 3 weeks after the first immunization, but before initiation of the treatment with ACTH), significant differences (P<0.05) were obtained despite the low number of individuals (Fig. 1 ) . Consequently, data for all immune parameters were blocked for effect of litter and sex when comparing experimental groups. The concentrations of cortisol in plasma are shown in Fig. 2 as mean values (nmol l-~ plasma) for the three groups of animals. Already at the first sampling, during the period of treatment with ACTH (43 h after initiating the treatment), the concentrations of cortisol were significantly increased (Group A: Day 23 compared with Day 21, P<0.05; Group B: Day 30 compared with Day 28, P< 0.01 ). The cortisol concentrations remained elevated throughout the period of ACTH treatment, but dropped below the normal level when the treatment was terminated (Day 37 ). Thereafter, the plasma concentrations of cortisol returned to normal levels. Significant differences between groups are shown in Fig. 2.  The number of lymphocytes (Fig. 3 (A) ) decreased significantly in blood obtained from the ACTH-treated animals, simultaneously with the increase in Shaded areas indicate periods when ACTH was not administered to any of the compared groups. The number of neutrophilic granulocytes (Fig. 3 (B) ) increased during the ACTH treatment. At all sampling occasions during this period, the neutrophil numbers were significantly higher in blood from the ACTH-treated pigs than in blood from the control pigs. For all animals, including the control animals, a marked increase (P< 0.01 ) in the total number of neutrophilic granulocytes was found 2 days after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae (Day 30 ). Fig. 4 to PHA and Con A were significantly suppressed in the whole blood cultures at all sampling occasions during ACTH treatment. Although significant, the suppression of the PWM-induced proliferation during the ACTH treatment was less evident. The ability to produce IL-2 in response to mitogen stimulation was assessed in whole blood cultures (Fig. 5 ) and in cultures of purified PBMC (results not shown). Clear suppressive effects of the ACTH treatment were seen, but only in whole blood cultures, and only with the mitogens PHA and Con A. In contrast, no inhibitory effects were noted in the cultures of purified PBMC.  No pig displayed detectable concentrations of IFN-ot (i.e. less than one unit ml-t ) in serum at any sampling occasion. A marked increase in the IFN-a producing capacity was observed after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae, both in cultures of purified PBMC and in whole blood cultures (Fig. 6) . In ACTH-treated pigs, this increase was evident earlier in cultures of purified PBMC, i.e. 2 days after the second immu- nization (Day 30), than in whole blood cultures (Day 37 ). With purified PBMC of the control pigs, the increased ability to produce IFN-t~ was not seen until Day 35, the same day as in cultures of whole blood obtained from these pigs. Comparison of the treatment groups during the ACTH treatment demonstrated that, when assessed in whole blood cultures, pigs in the control group (Group C) produced significantly more (P< 0.05) IFN-~ than ACTH-treated pigs (Group A) prior to the second immunization. Furthermore, pigs in Group C produced significantly more (P<0.01) IFN-cz than pigs in both Groups A and B at Day 35. The difference between Groups C and A remained significant (P< 0.01 ) throughout the experimental period. However, when assessed in cultures of purified PBMC, the ability to produce IFN-ot was lower among control pigs (Group C) than among ACTH-treated pigs (Groups A and B ) immediately after the second immunization. C=4.47+_0.28). A further increase in antibody titres was seen after the second immunization, reaching peak values on Day 37 (logto titre: A=4. 43_+0.32; B = 4.29 _ 0.26; C = 4.47 _ 0.28 ) . No significant differences between the experimental groups were found for the accumulated levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in serum. As illustrated in Fig. 7(A) , the quantities of antibodies produced in vitro at stimulation with M. hyopneumoniae antigen increased continuously until Day 25 for PBMC obtained from the non-treated pigs (Groups B and C). This increase was retarded for PBMC obtained from ACTH-treated pigs (Group A) and was significantly lower (P<0.05) at Days 23 and 25 for the ACTH-treated pigs than for the non-treated pigs (Groups B plus C). The response to the first immunization also decreased to a significantly lower level (P<0.01; Day 30) for animals in Group A than for those in Groups B and C, respectively. After the second immunization (Days 32 and 35), isolated PBMC of all pigs became increasingly able to produce specific antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae (Fig. 7 (B) ) and thereafter (at Days 37 to 49) decreased. During this period, no differences were noted between the experimental groups. The ability to produce Ig at stimulation with a sub-mitogenic dose of PWM was tested with purified PBMC. The Ig production of PBMC from the various pigs ranged from 0.04 to 0.61 ng mi-~ culture medium during the experimental period, but no significant effects of treatment with ACTH in vivo were observed (results not shown ). A model to study the effect of experimentally induced stress was established in swine. Daily treatments with ACTH elevated the endogenous production of cortisol to levels corresponding to those elicited in pigs by restricted ability to move, electric pulsation or heat stress (Becker et al., 1985 ) . By this 'stress model', cortisol was found to influence the T-cell-dependent antibody production of PBMC to M. hyopneumoniae, but not the T-cell independent, polyclonally induced immunoglobulin production. Further, both the proliferation and IL-2 production were suppressed by cortisol when induced by the T-cell mitogens PHA and Con A, but not by PWM, which is believed to act both on T and B lymphocytes (Sharon, 1983) . Therefore, it seems likely that cortisol, also in swine, interferes with the production of IL-2 as described earlier for human (Bettens et al., 1984) and bovine (Blecha and Baker, 1986) cells. As genetic differences have been previously described for several immune parameters (Edfors-Lilja et al., 1991 , 1993 , pigs from four litters were alloted to the experimental groups to eliminate these differences. This procedure increased the individual variation within the groups, but made it possible to use a statistical method blocking for the effect of sex and litter origin when analysing data. The ACTH-induced neutrophilia and lymphopenia resemble the alterations in differential white blood cell counts, normally achieved by sustained elevation of cortisol levels (Quinn, 1990) . Two days after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae, the highest neutrophil numbers were recorded for all pigs, including those in the control group. Consequently, both the ACTH treatment and the immunization could be mirrored in the differential white blood cell counts. The proliferation and IL-2 production in response to mitogen stimulation were tested both in whole blood cultures and in cultures of purified PBMC. In accordance with earlier studies on oestradiol (Magnusson and Fossum, 1992 ) , the most pronounced effects were found in the whole blood cultures stimulated with PHA or Con A. As hormones are known to alter the number of blood lymphocytes, this has to be considered when functional tests are carried out in whole blood cultures. In the previous study on oestradiol, no significant correlation between cpm values and the total number of PBMC per milliliter of blood in the samples was found. Further, no significant effects of cell concentration were seen on the magnitude of proliferation in a pilot study where whole blood from four pigs was serial diluted and stimulated with PHA (mean cpm values_+ SD in blood diluted 1:10; 16332_+9631, 1:15; 12 150+_4170, 1:20; 10529_+7412, 1:25; 11 363 _+ 8542). Further, the responses to stimulation with PWM (proliferation and IL-2 production) were not severely affected, despite the variation in the number of PBMC per unit blood. Therefore, it is most likely that the glucocorticoid not only reduced the number of mononuclear cells in the blood circulation but also affected their responsiveness to stimulation with the T-cell mitogens PHA and Con A. In accordance with Nowacki et al. ( 1993 ) , who described a transient increase of porcine natural-interferon-producing (NIP) cell frequency in connection with vaccination, an increase in the IFN-a-producing capacity was found after the second immunization for all animals. When analysed in whole blood cultures, this increase in IFN-a-producing capacity was not as high for pigs treated for 2 weeks with ACTH as for pigs in the other two experimental groups. In contrast, when analysed in cultures of purified PBMC, the increase in the IFN-c~-producing capacity was more pronounced for ACTH-treated pigs than for non-treated pigs. One explanation for these discrepancies could be that the negative influence of cortisol seen in whole blood cultures is reduced when the PBMC are purified and cultured in medium free from cortisol. However, this is probably not the only explanation, as purified PBMC obtained from the ACTH treated pigs produced approximately twice the amount of IFN-a as PBMC obtained from the control pigs did. For example, if the number of a very efficient but rare circulating cell population, such as the porcine NIP-cell (one per 1000 PBMC), is unaltered despite the occurrence of lymphopenia, an enrichment of NIP cells in cultures with a fixed number of purified PBMC could account for the relatively higher amounts of IFN-a produced. In this context, it is notable that enrichment of porcine IFNproducing leukocytes increases the IFN yield per cell (Nowacki and Charley, 1993) . Despite this, a lower amount of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae was produced in vitro at Days 23 and 25 and the time to reach the peak response to the primary immunization was delayed in the ACTH-treated animals, no differences between the groups were seen in their in vitro or in vivo responses to the second immunization. These results agree with those of Oldham and Bridger (1992) , who demonstrated that the time at which dexamethasone (DX) was administered to calves in relation to rotavirus infection was decisive as to the effect it had on their antibody production. When DX treatment started after primary, but before secondary, infection the systemic and local responses were not affected while they were inhibited when the DX treatment commenced prior to the primary infection. In the latter case, the clinical signs of disease were also greater. Consequently, the present experimental results suggest that 'stressors' that elicit an increased production of cortisol may interfere with the immune capacity of swine. This can be of clinical importance when pigs are exposed to new micro-organisms and external stressors simultaneously, e.g. when mixed and transported to new environments.",

         "Suppression of bovine lymphocyte responses to mitogens following in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone",
         "Gnotobiotic calves given intramuscular injections of dexamethasone (DM, 0.5 mg kg(−1) day(−1)) showed marked changes in haematological parameters including a neutrophilia and a lymphopaenia. Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P<0.01) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and poke-weed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2(−), CD5(+), CD8(−), CD4(−) and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.",

         "The administration of glucocorticosteroids (GC) is widely used as an experimental means of mimicking the immunosuppressive effects of a stressinduced rise in blood cortisol. Glucocorticosteroid-induced immunosuppression is also used in the therapy of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and in the study of immune responses to infectious agents (Davies and Carmichael, 1973; Crouch et al., 1985 ) . The result of GC treatment on the immune system varies considerably between species giving rise to designations of a species being either \"cortisone-resistant\" or \"cortisone-sensitive\" (Claman et al., 1971 ). However, not only is there interspecies variation but the effects of GC treatment are dependent on other parameters such as the age of the animal (Yang and Schultz, 1986 ) and the dose of GC used (Roth and Kaeberle, 1982 ) . Although cattle are regarded as a \"corticosteroid-resistant\" species (Wilkie et al., 1979 ) , suppression of proliferative responses of cattle peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens has been reported following both in vivo administration ofGC (Muscoplat et al., 1975; Roth et al., 1984; Pruett et al., 1987) and in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with GC (Ojo-Amaize et al., 1988) . However, there has been no comparison in cattle of in vivo and in vitro effects ofdexamethasone (DM) either on responses to the three mitogens most commonly used, i.e. phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM), or on different sub-populations of T cells. In cattle, as in other animal species, the equivalents of the T helper/inducer (CD4 ÷, CD8-, CD2 ÷, CD5 ÷ ) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (CD4-, CD8 ÷, CD2 ÷, CD5 ÷ ) cells represent two major sub-populations in the peripheral blood. However, a third numerically large sub-population is also present in cattle. These are CD2-, CD5 ÷, CD4-, CD8- (Clevers et al., 1990) and express the gamma/delta (~,/~) form of T cell receptor (TCR). They can be identified with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against a surface molecule with a molecular mass (Mr) of 215-300 kDa, called the BoWC1 antigen, that has no known human CD homologue (Clevers, 1990; Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . These cells are called BoWC 1 ÷ for convenience here, in accordance with the recommendation of the recent workshop on bovine leukocyte differentiation antigens (Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . In this paper we compare the effects of both in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone (DM) on the responsiveness of calflymphocytes to PHA, ConA and PWM. Also, we relate these observations to changes in lymphocyte sub-populations in the peripheral blood occurring during DM treatment. Ten gnotobiotic (nine male, one female) calves, from 7 to 43 days of age were used in the in vivo experiments. These animals were produced and reared on a milk-based diet Hoare et al., 1976) . Calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups (n = 5 ), Group A remained untreated, whilst Group B received daily injections of DM ('Dexadreson', Intervet, Cambridge, UK; intra-muscular, 0.5 mg kg-1 body weight) for 20 days starting at between 11 and 15 days of age. Blood was collected regularly, at the same time of day and shortly before the injection of DM for haematological analysis and to prepare mononuclear cells to assess proliferative responses to mitogens (see below). Mononuclear cells were obtained from two calves in Group B prior to and during DM treatment and were used for the determination of cell sub-populations by FACS analysis (see below). Blood was taken from six male gnotobiotic and seven male conventional calves aged between 17 and 260 days for in vitro experiments. Mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were taken from two of these animals at slaughter. Blood was collected in vessels containing heparin (20 units ml-I). Total white blood cell counts were made and differential counts were performed on Leishman stained blood smears. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation of heparinised blood over Histopaque 1083 (Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK) at 900 × g for 40 min. Suspensions of mesenteric lymph node and spleen cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.15 M, pH 7.2 ) were obtained from tissues disrupted by pressing through a wire mesh before centrifugation over Histopaque as above. The cells from the interface were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in tissue culture medium at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells ml-1. The tissue culture medium used was RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with heat-inactivated (56 ° C, 30 min) 10% FCS (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU ml-1 penicillin, 0.2 mg ml-1 streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES and 27 mM sodium bicarbonate. Mononuclear cell preparations (0.2 ml, 2 X 10 6 cells ml -I ) were cultured in fiat-bottomed microplates (Nunclon Delta, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with or without the addition of mitogens. Optimal concentrations of the mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM (all mitogens purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK) were determined in previous experiments and were 45 #g ml-l, 5 #g ml-I and 1 : 100 of stock, respectively. All cultures were set up in triplicate and the mean used in subsequent calculations. After culture for 72 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, 1 /~Ci [3H]thymidine ( [3H ] TdR, 5 Ci mmol -l, Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, UK) was added to each well. After a further 5 h culture, the cells were harvested onto glassfibre filters with a semi-automated harvester. Incorporation of [ 3H ] TdR into cellular DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting and the results expressed as counts per minute (cpm). Lymphocyte proliferation was assayed with cells from untreated control calves as described above. Tenfold dilutions of DM were made in tissue culture medium and added to some of the cultures to give a range of final concentrations from 5.1 X 10-4 M to 5.1 X 10-lo M. Dexamethasone was added at the start of lymphocyte culture and proliferation was assessed by incorporation of [ 3H ] TdR and the results expressed as the percentage of the control culture. Proliferation, % of control -cpm culture with DM 1 O0 cpm culture without DM X In three experiments, recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL2, Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK) was added to the cells over a range of concentrations at the commencement of culture. Proliferation was assessed as above and the results expressed as the percentage of the control culture. cpm culture with DM + IL2 Proliferation, % of control-cpm culture without DM + IL2 × 100 Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 10 ml; 2 X 10 6 cells ml-1 ) were cultured in 25-cm 2 flasks (Nunc) to study the in vitro effect of DM on cell surface markers. They were cultured in the presence or absence of the mitogens, PHA or ConA, added at optimal concentrations, and without DM or with DM added at two concentrations, 10 -9 M or 10 -6 M. After 72 h culture, the cells in the flasks were transferred into plastic Universals (Flow) and washed twice with PBS prior to staining for surface antigens (see below). The mAbs used for immunofluorescent staining of cell suspensions together with their specificities are listed in Table 1 . Monoclonal antibody IL-A51 is considered to recognise the BoCD8 antigen (Ellis et al., 1986; Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . Monoclonal antibody IL-A21 recognises a non-polymorphic MHC class II determinant in cattle (kindly provided by the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Disease, Kenya). Monoclonal antibody CC 15 is directed against the BoWC 1 antigen present on the BoCD2-, BoCD5 ÷, BoCD4-, BoCD8-, T lymphocyte sub-population in bovine peripheral blood and recognises the equivalent population to those cells expressing SBU-19 in sheep (MacKay, 1988; Clevers et al., 1990) . Monoclonal antibody CC21 is directed against an antigen with an approximate molecular mass of 145 kDa that is present on peripheral bovine B cells (Naessens et al., 1990) . Suspensions of cells were stained for surface antigen expression as described previously (Howard et al., 1989 ) for examination on a FACS Analyser or FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) except that FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL, USA) was utilised for analysis on a FACScan. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences between mean proliferative responses. Analyses comparing the differences between responses by control and DMtreated calves used the results (i.e. counts per minute) without further manipulation. Analyses comparing the differences between responses to PHA, ConA and PWM in the DM-treated group used the mean response to each mitogen (in cpm) between days 7 and 20 post-treatment for individual animals, expressed as a percentage of the mean response for the control (untreated) group to the same mitogen over the same period. Calves receiving DM treatment developed slight hair loss, exopthalmos and apathy after about 1 week of treatment. There were no more infections in the immunosuppressed group compared with the control group but this was expected as the calves were gnotobiotes and were maintained in isolators as described in the Materials and Methods Section. The number of circulating white blood cells (WBC) rose within 24 h of the first injection of DM and was highest after 48 h (Fig. 1 ) . The increased WBC count seen on Days 1-4 following DM treatment ( Fig. 1 (a) ) was accounted for by a large increase in the numbers of circulating neutrophils ( Fig. 1 (b) ). However, while total leukocyte counts had returned to normal by Day 5 of DM treatment, the numbers of neutrophils, after an initial decline from peak numbers, remained elevated for a further 11 days ( Fig. 1 (b) ). In contrast, the numbers of mononuclear cells in the circulation fell sharply within 24 h of the start of DM treatment and remained at these reduced levels (approximately 25% of the pre-DM level) until the end of the period of treatment ( Fig. 1 (c) ). The total and differential leukocyte counts of the control calves (Group A ) remained relatively constant throughout the experimental period (Figs. 1 (a)-1 (c) ) except for one calf which had an unexplained high neutrophil count on Day 14 ( Fig. l(b) ). Lymphocytes from DM-treated calves showed significantly (P< 0.01 ) decreased responsiveness to the mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM when compared with non-treated calves. However, the level of suppression was similar for all three mitogens. The mean level of suppression between Days 7 and 20 after the start of DM treatment was 83.7% for PHA, 68.7% for ConA and 75.3% for PWM. The results presented in Fig. 2 are from two representative calves from each group and demonstrate the kinetics of suppression to the three mitogens following DM treatment. Despite continued daily injections of DM, all calves showed transient recoveries in the immune responsiveness of their circulating lymphocytes on one or more occasions during the course of treatment (Fig. 2) .  In vitro addition of DM to cultures of lymphocytes from control calves markedly suppressed PHA responses (results not shown). The proliferative response to PHA was suppressed at low concentrations of DM (5.1 X 10-9 M) in 11 out of 12 calves. However, cells from six of these 11 calves with suppressed proliferative responses showed a recovery of their PHA responsiveness when the concentration of DM was increased to 5.1 × 10 -6 M or greater. Dexamethasone had no effect on the in vitro PHA response by lymphocytes from one calf. In marked contrast, the response to ConA was virtually unaffected even at very high concentrations ( 5.1 X 10-4 M ) of DM in eight out of ten calves tested (results not shown). In one of the two calves where DM suppressed the ConA response, the suppression was only modest (approximately 50% of the control proliferation ) and recovery of responsiveness was seen at higher DM concentrations as with PHA responses in some calves. Proliferative responses to PWM were variable; responses by lymphocytes from some animals were enhanced, some were suppressed while others were unaffected (results not shown). The responses of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocyte to PHA, ConA and PWM were affected by DM in the same manner as blood lymphocytes (Figs. 3 (a)-3 (c) ). One possible explanation for the in vitro suppression of PHA responsiveness was that DM was inhibiting IL-2 production. In order to test this possi- bility, IL-2 was added to PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures in the presence or absence of DM. These tests were carried out using lymphocytes from three calves (Fig. 4 ) . Two different patterns of suppression of the PHA response were observed. Lymphocytes from Calf 1 behaved in a similar way to that seen in previous calves with suppression increasing with increasing concentration of DM. However, lymphocytes from the other two calves exhibited maximal suppression at a DM concentration of 5.1 × 10-8 M and as the DM concentration increased above this, a lower degree of suppression was obtained. Despite these differences, addition of recombinant human IL-2 to the cultures at either 1 unit ml -~ (Calves 2 and 3) or 4 units ml -t (Calf 1 ) was able to, at least partially, restore responsiveness. There was a depletion in the absolute numbers of B cells (slg ÷ ), T cells (CD5 ÷, although this also includes a minor sub-population of B cells) and macrophages from the circulation following DM treatment (Table 2 ) . However, the reduction in B cell numbers was more marked than the reduction of either T cells or macrophages. Similar results were obtained with two other mAbs to B cell antigens, either surface IgM or the 145 kDa B cell antigen (data not shown). Table 2 (Table 3) . Treatment with DM reduced both the number and percentage of circulating BoWC 1 ÷ cells, whereas, although the numbers of BoCD2 + T cells were reduced, their proportion of the total population did not decline. When the BoCD2 + T cell population was subdivided into BoCD4 +, BoCD8-and BoCD4-, BoCD8 ÷ sub-populations, no differences were seen between these two cell types in their sensitivity to DM. face antigens was analysed to determine whether this suppression was associated with a phenotypic change in the cells present in culture. There was no marked alteration in the percentage of cells expressing the majority of cell surface antigens following culture with DM (Table 4) . How- ever, BoCD8 and MHC II expression were affected. In the presence of PHA, DM (10-6 M) increased the percentage of cells expressing BoCD8. In contrast, MHC II expression was reduced by DM. The latter finding was most marked with cells cultured in the absence of mitogen, while the increased MHC II expression induced by culture with either PHA or ConA showed a more modest decrease. In addition to the change in the percentage of cells staining for MHC II antigens there was also a decrease in the overall intensity of staining for this molecule in the absence of PHA (Fig. 5 ) . The results presented here show that the DM regimen used for the immunosuppression of young calves induces marked changes in haematological values. The magnitude of these changes compared with the minor changes seen by others (Pruett et al., 1987) is due probably to the high dose of DM and age of animals used in our studies. Our finding that responses to mitogens are suppressed following in vivo DM treatment are similar to those of Roth et al. (1984) who demonstrated suppression of both PHA and PWM in DM-treated steers. However, Pruett and colleagues found in stressed heifers that responses to ConA were more sensitive to suppression than those to PHA (Pruett et al., 1986) and PWM responses were enhanced in DM-treated steers (Pruett et al., 1987 ) . The differences between the results of the present study and those of Pruett et al. (1987 ) are unclear, but, as above, are probably a result of differences in the doses of GC used. The in vitro studies carried out in parallel with our in vivo studies confirmed the sensitivity of the PHA response to the presence of dexamethasone. In contrast to the in vivo studies however, ConA responses were unaffected by in vitro culture with DM, even at very high concentrations. This finding would indicate that GC suppressed responses to PHA and ConA by different mechanisms or that PHA and ConA stimulate differently. Given in vivo, GC result in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the blood to other lymphoid organs (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and this effect may have caused the depressed ConA and PWM responses seen following in vivo DM treatment. Redistribution of lymphocytes in vivo may have affected the PHA responses but the results obtained in vitro with DM suggested that DM also exerted a specific physiological effect on responses to PHA. Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to inhibit the production of IL-2 (Bettens et al., 1984 ) , tumour necrosis factor (Waage and Bakke, 1988 ) , ILl (Lee et al., 1988) in man and IL-3 (Culpepper and Lee, 1985) in mice. On the other hand, IL-4 production by a mouse Th clone was not affected by DM (Bertoglio and Leroux, 1988 ) . Gillis et al. ( 1979 ) found that addition of uncharacterised exogenous T cell growth factor to GC-suppressed cultures of mouse lymphocytes completely restored responsiveness. Similarly, in this study, PHA responsiveness was restored by the addition of exogenous recombinant human IL-2. This finding implies that the suppression of PHA responses by DM is due, at least partially, to blocked induction of IL-2 expression. Additionally, the inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression (Reed et al., 1986) may account for the incomplete restoration of the proliferative response by exogenous IL-2. • The effects of GC treatment on the expression of cell membrane components are variable, some being increased while others are decreased (Duval et al., 1983 ) . Another explanation for the difference in results seen with PHA and ConA is that there is a selective GC-mediated suppression of a molecule involved with the PHA responsiveness of lymphocytes. MHC II expression by the mitogen-presenting cell has been demonstrated by Torbett et al. ( 1986 ) to be essential for PHA (but not ConA) responses in the mouse. Of all the surface antigens examined in this study, only MHC II expression was reduced. However, the modest level of suppression seen with DM in mitogenstimulated cultures was not considered sufficient to explain the observed lack of responsiveness. The CD2 molecule on the T cell has been reported to bind PHA and to be involved in PHA-induced stimulation (O'Flynn et al., 1985 ) . The equivalent molecule in our study, BoCD2, was not affected by DM in vitro. As stated above, Pruett et al. (1987) found that while PHA and ConA responses were suppressed, PWM responses were enhanced and suggested that this differential responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogens was the result of a change in the sub-populations ofT lymphocytes. No data were presented by these authors to support this suggestion. Although we did not observe this differential responsiveness to the mitogens, we did observe changes in the populations of lymphocytes present in the circulation. Firstly, our results confirmed the reports of others (Wilkie et al., 1979; Pruett et al., 1987 ) that there was no selective loss of total T cells. However, we were able to demonstrate a selective loss from the circulation of the BoWC14, 7/~ T lymphocyte subpopulation• Previous findings have shown that in vivo depletion with mAbs in cattle resulted in a reduced response to all three mitogens in vitro if the BoCD4 ÷ lymphocytes were depleted, but an enhanced response to PWM alone if the BoWC 1 ÷ lymphocytes were depleted (Howard et al., 1989) . There is no obvious simple relationship between these observations and DM may have additional physiological effects on lymphocytes. The functions of the BoCD4 ÷ and BoCD8 ÷ cells in cattle are equivalent to those of the same phenotype in other animal species. The function of the BoWC1 + sub-population, that is highly sensitive to DM in vivo, is not fully understood• This phenotype characteristically produces the 7/~ form of TCR in ruminants (MacKay, 1988; Clevers et al., 1990) and may have a modulating effect on the immune response (Howard et al., 1989 ) . The relative lack of effect on cell surface mark-ers seen following in vitro culture with DM probably suggests that the changes seen in vivo are the result of a selective redistribution of cells from the circulation into peripheral lymphoid organs. In conclusion, we have shown that DM selectively depletes some lymphocyte populations from the circulation and suppresses peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to mitogens. We have also demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effects of DM differ depending on the mitogen being used and whether exposure to DM was carried out in vivo or in vitro. Clearly, different interpretations would be reached as to the cortisone sensitivity of the calves if only in vivo or in vitro studies had been conducted or if only one mitogen had been used in the proliferation tests. We would therefore suggest that the classification of a species as being corticosteroid-resistant or corticosteroidsensitive requires careful definition, not only of the age of the animal and dose of GC used, as others have demonstrated, but also of the tests used to assess immunosuppression and whether the tests are conducted following in vivo or in vitro exposure to GC. These results would also suggest that the mechanisms of stimulation by the mitogens PHA and ConA act through different pathways, perhaps at the second messenger level, and this system may provide a means whereby these pathways could be analysed.",
         "Suppression of bovine lymphocyte responses to mitogens following in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone. Gnotobiotic calves given intramuscular injections of dexamethasone (DM, 0.5 mg kg(−1) day(−1)) showed marked changes in haematological parameters including a neutrophilia and a lymphopaenia. Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P<0.01) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and poke-weed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2(−), CD5(+), CD8(−), CD4(−) and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.. The administration of glucocorticosteroids (GC) is widely used as an experimental means of mimicking the immunosuppressive effects of a stressinduced rise in blood cortisol. Glucocorticosteroid-induced immunosuppression is also used in the therapy of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and in the study of immune responses to infectious agents (Davies and Carmichael, 1973; Crouch et al., 1985 ) . The result of GC treatment on the immune system varies considerably between species giving rise to designations of a species being either \"cortisone-resistant\" or \"cortisone-sensitive\" (Claman et al., 1971 ). However, not only is there interspecies variation but the effects of GC treatment are dependent on other parameters such as the age of the animal (Yang and Schultz, 1986 ) and the dose of GC used (Roth and Kaeberle, 1982 ) . Although cattle are regarded as a \"corticosteroid-resistant\" species (Wilkie et al., 1979 ) , suppression of proliferative responses of cattle peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens has been reported following both in vivo administration ofGC (Muscoplat et al., 1975; Roth et al., 1984; Pruett et al., 1987) and in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with GC (Ojo-Amaize et al., 1988) . However, there has been no comparison in cattle of in vivo and in vitro effects ofdexamethasone (DM) either on responses to the three mitogens most commonly used, i.e. phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM), or on different sub-populations of T cells. In cattle, as in other animal species, the equivalents of the T helper/inducer (CD4 ÷, CD8-, CD2 ÷, CD5 ÷ ) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (CD4-, CD8 ÷, CD2 ÷, CD5 ÷ ) cells represent two major sub-populations in the peripheral blood. However, a third numerically large sub-population is also present in cattle. These are CD2-, CD5 ÷, CD4-, CD8- (Clevers et al., 1990) and express the gamma/delta (~,/~) form of T cell receptor (TCR). They can be identified with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against a surface molecule with a molecular mass (Mr) of 215-300 kDa, called the BoWC1 antigen, that has no known human CD homologue (Clevers, 1990; Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . These cells are called BoWC 1 ÷ for convenience here, in accordance with the recommendation of the recent workshop on bovine leukocyte differentiation antigens (Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . In this paper we compare the effects of both in vivo and in vitro treatment with dexamethasone (DM) on the responsiveness of calflymphocytes to PHA, ConA and PWM. Also, we relate these observations to changes in lymphocyte sub-populations in the peripheral blood occurring during DM treatment. Ten gnotobiotic (nine male, one female) calves, from 7 to 43 days of age were used in the in vivo experiments. These animals were produced and reared on a milk-based diet Hoare et al., 1976) . Calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups (n = 5 ), Group A remained untreated, whilst Group B received daily injections of DM ('Dexadreson', Intervet, Cambridge, UK; intra-muscular, 0.5 mg kg-1 body weight) for 20 days starting at between 11 and 15 days of age. Blood was collected regularly, at the same time of day and shortly before the injection of DM for haematological analysis and to prepare mononuclear cells to assess proliferative responses to mitogens (see below). Mononuclear cells were obtained from two calves in Group B prior to and during DM treatment and were used for the determination of cell sub-populations by FACS analysis (see below). Blood was taken from six male gnotobiotic and seven male conventional calves aged between 17 and 260 days for in vitro experiments. Mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were taken from two of these animals at slaughter. Blood was collected in vessels containing heparin (20 units ml-I). Total white blood cell counts were made and differential counts were performed on Leishman stained blood smears. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation of heparinised blood over Histopaque 1083 (Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK) at 900 × g for 40 min. Suspensions of mesenteric lymph node and spleen cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.15 M, pH 7.2 ) were obtained from tissues disrupted by pressing through a wire mesh before centrifugation over Histopaque as above. The cells from the interface were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in tissue culture medium at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells ml-1. The tissue culture medium used was RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with heat-inactivated (56 ° C, 30 min) 10% FCS (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU ml-1 penicillin, 0.2 mg ml-1 streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES and 27 mM sodium bicarbonate. Mononuclear cell preparations (0.2 ml, 2 X 10 6 cells ml -I ) were cultured in fiat-bottomed microplates (Nunclon Delta, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with or without the addition of mitogens. Optimal concentrations of the mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM (all mitogens purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK) were determined in previous experiments and were 45 #g ml-l, 5 #g ml-I and 1 : 100 of stock, respectively. All cultures were set up in triplicate and the mean used in subsequent calculations. After culture for 72 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, 1 /~Ci [3H]thymidine ( [3H ] TdR, 5 Ci mmol -l, Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, UK) was added to each well. After a further 5 h culture, the cells were harvested onto glassfibre filters with a semi-automated harvester. Incorporation of [ 3H ] TdR into cellular DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting and the results expressed as counts per minute (cpm). Lymphocyte proliferation was assayed with cells from untreated control calves as described above. Tenfold dilutions of DM were made in tissue culture medium and added to some of the cultures to give a range of final concentrations from 5.1 X 10-4 M to 5.1 X 10-lo M. Dexamethasone was added at the start of lymphocyte culture and proliferation was assessed by incorporation of [ 3H ] TdR and the results expressed as the percentage of the control culture. Proliferation, % of control -cpm culture with DM 1 O0 cpm culture without DM X In three experiments, recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL2, Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK) was added to the cells over a range of concentrations at the commencement of culture. Proliferation was assessed as above and the results expressed as the percentage of the control culture. cpm culture with DM + IL2 Proliferation, % of control-cpm culture without DM + IL2 × 100 Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 10 ml; 2 X 10 6 cells ml-1 ) were cultured in 25-cm 2 flasks (Nunc) to study the in vitro effect of DM on cell surface markers. They were cultured in the presence or absence of the mitogens, PHA or ConA, added at optimal concentrations, and without DM or with DM added at two concentrations, 10 -9 M or 10 -6 M. After 72 h culture, the cells in the flasks were transferred into plastic Universals (Flow) and washed twice with PBS prior to staining for surface antigens (see below). The mAbs used for immunofluorescent staining of cell suspensions together with their specificities are listed in Table 1 . Monoclonal antibody IL-A51 is considered to recognise the BoCD8 antigen (Ellis et al., 1986; Howard and Morrison, 1991 ) . Monoclonal antibody IL-A21 recognises a non-polymorphic MHC class II determinant in cattle (kindly provided by the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Disease, Kenya). Monoclonal antibody CC 15 is directed against the BoWC 1 antigen present on the BoCD2-, BoCD5 ÷, BoCD4-, BoCD8-, T lymphocyte sub-population in bovine peripheral blood and recognises the equivalent population to those cells expressing SBU-19 in sheep (MacKay, 1988; Clevers et al., 1990) . Monoclonal antibody CC21 is directed against an antigen with an approximate molecular mass of 145 kDa that is present on peripheral bovine B cells (Naessens et al., 1990) . Suspensions of cells were stained for surface antigen expression as described previously (Howard et al., 1989 ) for examination on a FACS Analyser or FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) except that FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL, USA) was utilised for analysis on a FACScan. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences between mean proliferative responses. Analyses comparing the differences between responses by control and DMtreated calves used the results (i.e. counts per minute) without further manipulation. Analyses comparing the differences between responses to PHA, ConA and PWM in the DM-treated group used the mean response to each mitogen (in cpm) between days 7 and 20 post-treatment for individual animals, expressed as a percentage of the mean response for the control (untreated) group to the same mitogen over the same period. Calves receiving DM treatment developed slight hair loss, exopthalmos and apathy after about 1 week of treatment. There were no more infections in the immunosuppressed group compared with the control group but this was expected as the calves were gnotobiotes and were maintained in isolators as described in the Materials and Methods Section. The number of circulating white blood cells (WBC) rose within 24 h of the first injection of DM and was highest after 48 h (Fig. 1 ) . The increased WBC count seen on Days 1-4 following DM treatment ( Fig. 1 (a) ) was accounted for by a large increase in the numbers of circulating neutrophils ( Fig. 1 (b) ). However, while total leukocyte counts had returned to normal by Day 5 of DM treatment, the numbers of neutrophils, after an initial decline from peak numbers, remained elevated for a further 11 days ( Fig. 1 (b) ). In contrast, the numbers of mononuclear cells in the circulation fell sharply within 24 h of the start of DM treatment and remained at these reduced levels (approximately 25% of the pre-DM level) until the end of the period of treatment ( Fig. 1 (c) ). The total and differential leukocyte counts of the control calves (Group A ) remained relatively constant throughout the experimental period (Figs. 1 (a)-1 (c) ) except for one calf which had an unexplained high neutrophil count on Day 14 ( Fig. l(b) ). Lymphocytes from DM-treated calves showed significantly (P< 0.01 ) decreased responsiveness to the mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM when compared with non-treated calves. However, the level of suppression was similar for all three mitogens. The mean level of suppression between Days 7 and 20 after the start of DM treatment was 83.7% for PHA, 68.7% for ConA and 75.3% for PWM. The results presented in Fig. 2 are from two representative calves from each group and demonstrate the kinetics of suppression to the three mitogens following DM treatment. Despite continued daily injections of DM, all calves showed transient recoveries in the immune responsiveness of their circulating lymphocytes on one or more occasions during the course of treatment (Fig. 2) .  In vitro addition of DM to cultures of lymphocytes from control calves markedly suppressed PHA responses (results not shown). The proliferative response to PHA was suppressed at low concentrations of DM (5.1 X 10-9 M) in 11 out of 12 calves. However, cells from six of these 11 calves with suppressed proliferative responses showed a recovery of their PHA responsiveness when the concentration of DM was increased to 5.1 × 10 -6 M or greater. Dexamethasone had no effect on the in vitro PHA response by lymphocytes from one calf. In marked contrast, the response to ConA was virtually unaffected even at very high concentrations ( 5.1 X 10-4 M ) of DM in eight out of ten calves tested (results not shown). In one of the two calves where DM suppressed the ConA response, the suppression was only modest (approximately 50% of the control proliferation ) and recovery of responsiveness was seen at higher DM concentrations as with PHA responses in some calves. Proliferative responses to PWM were variable; responses by lymphocytes from some animals were enhanced, some were suppressed while others were unaffected (results not shown). The responses of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocyte to PHA, ConA and PWM were affected by DM in the same manner as blood lymphocytes (Figs. 3 (a)-3 (c) ). One possible explanation for the in vitro suppression of PHA responsiveness was that DM was inhibiting IL-2 production. In order to test this possi- bility, IL-2 was added to PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures in the presence or absence of DM. These tests were carried out using lymphocytes from three calves (Fig. 4 ) . Two different patterns of suppression of the PHA response were observed. Lymphocytes from Calf 1 behaved in a similar way to that seen in previous calves with suppression increasing with increasing concentration of DM. However, lymphocytes from the other two calves exhibited maximal suppression at a DM concentration of 5.1 × 10-8 M and as the DM concentration increased above this, a lower degree of suppression was obtained. Despite these differences, addition of recombinant human IL-2 to the cultures at either 1 unit ml -~ (Calves 2 and 3) or 4 units ml -t (Calf 1 ) was able to, at least partially, restore responsiveness. There was a depletion in the absolute numbers of B cells (slg ÷ ), T cells (CD5 ÷, although this also includes a minor sub-population of B cells) and macrophages from the circulation following DM treatment (Table 2 ) . However, the reduction in B cell numbers was more marked than the reduction of either T cells or macrophages. Similar results were obtained with two other mAbs to B cell antigens, either surface IgM or the 145 kDa B cell antigen (data not shown). Table 2 (Table 3) . Treatment with DM reduced both the number and percentage of circulating BoWC 1 ÷ cells, whereas, although the numbers of BoCD2 + T cells were reduced, their proportion of the total population did not decline. When the BoCD2 + T cell population was subdivided into BoCD4 +, BoCD8-and BoCD4-, BoCD8 ÷ sub-populations, no differences were seen between these two cell types in their sensitivity to DM. face antigens was analysed to determine whether this suppression was associated with a phenotypic change in the cells present in culture. There was no marked alteration in the percentage of cells expressing the majority of cell surface antigens following culture with DM (Table 4) . How- ever, BoCD8 and MHC II expression were affected. In the presence of PHA, DM (10-6 M) increased the percentage of cells expressing BoCD8. In contrast, MHC II expression was reduced by DM. The latter finding was most marked with cells cultured in the absence of mitogen, while the increased MHC II expression induced by culture with either PHA or ConA showed a more modest decrease. In addition to the change in the percentage of cells staining for MHC II antigens there was also a decrease in the overall intensity of staining for this molecule in the absence of PHA (Fig. 5 ) . The results presented here show that the DM regimen used for the immunosuppression of young calves induces marked changes in haematological values. The magnitude of these changes compared with the minor changes seen by others (Pruett et al., 1987) is due probably to the high dose of DM and age of animals used in our studies. Our finding that responses to mitogens are suppressed following in vivo DM treatment are similar to those of Roth et al. (1984) who demonstrated suppression of both PHA and PWM in DM-treated steers. However, Pruett and colleagues found in stressed heifers that responses to ConA were more sensitive to suppression than those to PHA (Pruett et al., 1986) and PWM responses were enhanced in DM-treated steers (Pruett et al., 1987 ) . The differences between the results of the present study and those of Pruett et al. (1987 ) are unclear, but, as above, are probably a result of differences in the doses of GC used. The in vitro studies carried out in parallel with our in vivo studies confirmed the sensitivity of the PHA response to the presence of dexamethasone. In contrast to the in vivo studies however, ConA responses were unaffected by in vitro culture with DM, even at very high concentrations. This finding would indicate that GC suppressed responses to PHA and ConA by different mechanisms or that PHA and ConA stimulate differently. Given in vivo, GC result in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the blood to other lymphoid organs (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and this effect may have caused the depressed ConA and PWM responses seen following in vivo DM treatment. Redistribution of lymphocytes in vivo may have affected the PHA responses but the results obtained in vitro with DM suggested that DM also exerted a specific physiological effect on responses to PHA. Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to inhibit the production of IL-2 (Bettens et al., 1984 ) , tumour necrosis factor (Waage and Bakke, 1988 ) , ILl (Lee et al., 1988) in man and IL-3 (Culpepper and Lee, 1985) in mice. On the other hand, IL-4 production by a mouse Th clone was not affected by DM (Bertoglio and Leroux, 1988 ) . Gillis et al. ( 1979 ) found that addition of uncharacterised exogenous T cell growth factor to GC-suppressed cultures of mouse lymphocytes completely restored responsiveness. Similarly, in this study, PHA responsiveness was restored by the addition of exogenous recombinant human IL-2. This finding implies that the suppression of PHA responses by DM is due, at least partially, to blocked induction of IL-2 expression. Additionally, the inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression (Reed et al., 1986) may account for the incomplete restoration of the proliferative response by exogenous IL-2. • The effects of GC treatment on the expression of cell membrane components are variable, some being increased while others are decreased (Duval et al., 1983 ) . Another explanation for the difference in results seen with PHA and ConA is that there is a selective GC-mediated suppression of a molecule involved with the PHA responsiveness of lymphocytes. MHC II expression by the mitogen-presenting cell has been demonstrated by Torbett et al. ( 1986 ) to be essential for PHA (but not ConA) responses in the mouse. Of all the surface antigens examined in this study, only MHC II expression was reduced. However, the modest level of suppression seen with DM in mitogenstimulated cultures was not considered sufficient to explain the observed lack of responsiveness. The CD2 molecule on the T cell has been reported to bind PHA and to be involved in PHA-induced stimulation (O'Flynn et al., 1985 ) . The equivalent molecule in our study, BoCD2, was not affected by DM in vitro. As stated above, Pruett et al. (1987) found that while PHA and ConA responses were suppressed, PWM responses were enhanced and suggested that this differential responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogens was the result of a change in the sub-populations ofT lymphocytes. No data were presented by these authors to support this suggestion. Although we did not observe this differential responsiveness to the mitogens, we did observe changes in the populations of lymphocytes present in the circulation.

         "The effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-α) in vitro and in vivo on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free cats. Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 10(4) or 10(3) International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10(−3) U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 10(4)–10(2) U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-(3)H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 10(4) U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (10(6) U/kg), moderate dose (10(4) U/kg), or a relatively low dose (10(2) U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 10(6) U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 10(4) or 10(2) U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses.

INTRODUCTION Interferons (IFN) are a group of cellular proteins that inhibit viral replication, modulate immune responses, inhibit normal cellular division and have antitumor activity (Borden and Ball, 1981 ) . There are several classes of IFN ( a, fl and y) which differ on the basis of their antigenic, biological and physic ochemical properties (Mannering and Deloria, 1986) . Because IFN (particularly human IFN-c~ ) has antiviral and immunomodulatory activities that cross species lines (Pallikoff et al., 1962; Desmyter et al., 1968; Gresser et al., 1974; Krakowka et al., 1988) and because recombinant DNA-produced human IFN is now available in relatively large quantity, the use of human IFN in veterinary medicine has increased. Human IFN-c~ has been used clinically in cattle afflicted with respiratory diseases (Roney et al., 1985; Cummins and Hutcheson, 1986) , in cats infected with either feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) , and in dogs infected with canine parvovirus (Dr. J. Cummins, unpublished data, 1986) . Dosages of IFN used clinically in domestic animals have been empirical and extrapolated largely from studies in persons or mice using interferon preparations that can differ in purity and potency. Unfortunately, studies of the immunological effects of homologous or heterologous IFN in domestic animals have been lacking; the effects of human IFN-c~ in vitro on canine immune responses, however, have recently been reported (Krakowka et al., 1988) . Our interest in studying IFN is related to its application clinically as an antiviral and immunomodulating drug in cats with viral diseases. The effects of heterologous IFNs on feline immune responses in general are not known. Resistance to diseases such as FIP is associated with effective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985; ; cats infected with other viruses like FeLV may have severely impaired T-cell responses (Rojko and Olsen, 1984 ) . Obviously, an understanding of the relationship between IFN dosage and modulation of CMI is necessary prior to recommending IFN as treatment for viral diseases where stimulation of CMI is required. Mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis, which is a widely used in vitro assay for evaluation of CMI (Oppenheim and Schechter, 1976) , has been used previously in cats to assess alterations in CMI induced by immunomodulating agents such as cyclosporin (Gregory et al., 1987 ) . In the studies reported here, the effects of doses of human IFN-c~ in vitro and in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis in normal cats was investigated. The cats used in these studies were healthy, 10-12-month-old specific-path-ogen-free (SPF) males and females, weighing approximately 3.5 kg. The cats were purchased from a commercial breeder (Liberty Laboratories, Liberty Corners, NJ ) and were FeLV test-negative (by ELISA) and feline coronavirus antibody-negative prior to the studies. The cats were housed separately in cages located in the Scott-Ritchey Animal Isolation Facility and were tested and cared for according to humane standards as set forth in the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (Publication No. 85-23, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All experimental protocols were approved by an independent animal welfare committee prior to the studies. The recombinant DNA-derived (Bgl-II restriction endonuclease-specified) human leukocyte (alpha) hybrid {subtypes A/D) IFN (rHuIFN-a), lot no. RO-23-1740, was kindly supplied by Dr. Richard Cordts, Hoffman LaRoche, Nutley, NJ. The IFN was stored lyophilized (at a concentration of 50X 106 International Units (U)/vial) at -80°C prior to use. The IFN was diluted before use in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; pH 7.2) and was sterilefiltered through a 0.2 ]~M cellulose acetate membrane (Nalge Co, Rochester, NY ). The biological activity of the rHuIFN-c~ (expressed in U/ml of antiviral activity) was determined in the manufacturer's laboratory, using an international reference standard for human leukocyte IFN. Cats were lightly anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (Vetalar; Parke, Davis & Co, Detroit, MI) and blood collected by jugular venipuncture into glass syringes containing heparin (10 units/ml of blood). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated and prepared as previously described (Cockerell et al., 1975; Tham et al., 1982) . Briefly, PBL were separated by Ficoll-diatrizoate (Histopaque-1077; Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) gradient separation and the interface mononuclear cells collected and washed in HBSS. The washed cells were resuspended to 2 X 106 viable cells/ml in tissue culture growth medium (GM) consisting of RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin/ml and 100/lg of streptomycin/ml along with 1.0 mM L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES. For the in vitro IFN studies, PBL (2.0 X 105 cells, 0.1 ml) were pipetted into wells of sterile 96-well flat-bottom microtitration plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and then incubated with GM containing varying amounts of rHuIFN-a or GM only (0.1 ml/well) for 24 h at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. For the in vivo studies, preincubation of PBL with IFN was omitted. The cell suspensions were then cultured 72 h with either concanavalin A (Con A) (0.6 ttg/well) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) (0.5 ttg/well), or they were not treated with mitogens (6 replicates/treatment). Previous titrations in feline PBL indicated that the concentrations of mitogen used were optimal for our assay. To each well, 0.5/~Ci (0.025 ml ) of [methyl-3H ]thymidine (specific activity 6.7 Ci/mmol) (Dupont, NEN Research Products, Boston, MA) was added for the last 20 h of incubation. The cultures were then stored at -80 ° C until harvested. Cells were harvested using a semi-automatic multiple cell microharvester (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) so that the cellular proteins were collected onto glass fiber filter paper strips (Bellco). The paper strips were dried at 60 °C for 30 min and the filter discs transferred to scintillation vials into which 5 ml of toluene base cocktail (Scinti Verse II; Fischer Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) was added. The incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA was quantitated in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (LKB-Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) using channels ratio method of quench correction. The net counts per minute (c.p.m.) of a total of 6 wells for each variable were averaged to obtain the mean c.p.m. The stimulation index (s.i.) was determined by dividing the mean c.p.m, of the mitogen-stimulated (or rHuIFN-~-stimulated only) cells by the mean c.p.m, of unstimulated (media control) cells. Stock solutions of IFN, thymidine and fetal calf serum were prepared from the same lots, respectively, prior to the studies and only fresh reagents were used. To determine the potential cytotoxic effect of rHuIFN-c~ on feline PBL, lymphocytes were isolated from eight normal cats as described before and were exposed to varying amounts of rHuIFN-c~ continuously for several days. Briefly, freshly isolated PBL (2.0 × 105 cells, 0.1 ml) were cultured with GM (0.1 ml/ well) containing rHuIFN-c~ (ranges, 104-1.0 U/ml) or GM only for 96 h at 37°C in 96-well microtitration plates (6 replicates/dose). The nonadherent cells were aspirated from a total of 6 wells for each IFN dose; the number of viable cells, determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, were counted in duplicate using a Neubauer hemocytometer. Results were expressed as mean viable cell density (number of viable cells/ml) in rHuIFN-c~-treated or medium control cultures. A study was designed to evaluate the effects of giving varying amounts of rHuIFN-c~ parenterally on lymphocyte blastogenesis in cats. Cats were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups and were treated as follows: a high-dose IFN group (n= 10 cats) received a single injection i.m. of rHuIFN-~ at a dosage of 106 U/kg; a moderate-dose IFN group (n=4 cats) likewise received 104 U of rHuIFN-c~/kg; and a low-dose IFN group (n=4 cats) similarly received 102 U of rHuIFN-c~/kg. Three additional cats were inoculated similarly with HBSS (diluent controls). Cats were evaluated by lymphocyte blastogenesis in response to phytomitogens at 24 h postinoculation. In order to minimize normal diurnal variation in test results, all cats were evaluated by lymphocyte blastogenesis at 24-h intervals on 3 successive days preceding inoculation and then 24 h postinoculation. For each group of cats, a single preinoculation mean Con A or PWM response (3-day average) was determined and then compared statistically against the corresponding postinoculation group mean. Each group of cats was evaluated separately on alternate weeks. The one-tailed Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance between groups. All data analysis was performed using a computerized statistical analysis program (Abstat; Anderson-Bell, Canon City, CO). A conservative number of degrees of freedom was used (i.e., one for each animal rather than one for each well). P values of ~< 0.05 were considered significant. Incubation of normal feline PBL with doses of rHuIFN-a in vitro suppressed lymphocyte proliferative responses to Con A and PWM (Table 1) . Suppression of blastogenesis was dose-dependent; significant inhibition occurred at relatively high in vitro doses of rHuIFN-c~ (104 or 103 U/ml). Doses of 102 U of rHuIFN-c~/ml also decreased mean Con A or PWM responses, but this effect was not statistically significant. Lower doses of rHuIFN-a (10.0-10-3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. Incorporation of [methyl-3H ] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA in the absence of phytomitogens was significantly inhibited in feline PBL cultures exposed to rHuIFN-~ doses of 104-10.0 U/ml compared to untreated PBL (Table 2) . Mean thymidine incorporation (c.p.m.) in cultures treated with 104-102 or with 10.0 U/ml was approximately 14% or 50%, respectively, of the thymidine incorporation measured in untreated cells. Varying amounts of rHuIFN-c~ (104-1.0 U/ml) were added to PBL cultures to determine whether direct cytotoxic effects from the IFN itself may have contributed to the dose-related suppression of blastogenesis observed in vitro. Differences in mean viable cell density between untreated PBL cultures and those treated with IFN, however, were not observed. (Fig. 1) .  To determine the effects of varying amounts of rHuIFN-a in vivo on mitogen-induced blastogenesis, cats in each of three groups were given a single injection of either a high (106 U/kg), moderate (104 U/kg), or relatively low dose (102 U/kg) of rHuIFN-~ and then evaluated 24 h later. To minimize normal diurnal variation in responses, a 3-day average of daily mean responses was determined preinoculation for each group. Day-to-day variation in blastogenic responses of individual cats evaluated on 3 consecutive days of the same week was not significant (P > 0.05, n---18; data not shown). Cats inoculated with a single high dose of rHuIFN-~ had a significant suppression (P= 0.037) in Con A-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values ( Fig. 2A) . Mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast to the cats inoculated with a high dose of rHuIFN-~, cats given 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-c~/kg had significantly enhanced (P=0.008 or 0.05, respectively) blastogenic responses to Con A; PWM responses, however, were unaffected ( Fig. 2B and C ) . Inoculation of cats with HBSS alone had no significant effect on mitogen-induced blastogenesis 24 h postinoculation (data not shown). The effects of IFN in vitro or in vivo on the immune system are manyfold and sometimes apparently contradictory. Overall, it appears that IFN can either stimulate or suppress various arms of the immune response, depending on the timing of administration and dosage (Epstein, 1977) . IFN in general seems to inhibit immunologic responses when given prior to an immunogen but enhances responses if given some days later (White and Fenner, 1986) . Moreover, high doses of IFN can produce opposite effects or annul the responses obtained with much lower doses. For example, very low doses of IFN-c~ in vitro or in vivo may stimulate development of antibody-forming spleen cells in mice, whereas high doses are immunosuppressive (Braun and Levy, 1972; Epstein, 1977) . The addition of low doses of IFN (10 or 100 units/ml) in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction increases the cytotoxic response in mice severalfold, but larger doses (104 units/ml ) depress the response (Fradelizi and Gresser, 1982 ) . Similarly, low doses of IFN can enhance lymphocyte blastogenesis in mice or persons, whereas large doses are suppressive (Miorner et al., 1978; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1980) . Depending on the timing of administration, extremely low doses of IFN-~, fl (2 × 10-lO U) in mice significantly increase the number of antibody-secreting cells in spleen and strongly stimulate cytotoxic activities of allospecific T-cells (Daurat et al., 1988) . The results-of this study showed that very high doses of rHuIFN-~ either in vitro or in vivo suppressed mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses in cats. The rHuIFN-~ also directly inhibited the in vitro incorporation of [methyl-3H ]thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA of unstimulated PBL and at much lower IFN concentrations than those required to suppress mitogen-induced blastogenesis. The inhibitory effects of various types of IFN on DNA synthesis and lymphocyte blastogenesis after mitogenic stimulation have been described previously in different species, including mice, cattle, and persons (Lindahl-Magnusson et al., 1972; Blomgren et al., 1974; Bielefeldt-Ohman and Babiuk, 1986; Kim et al., 1988; Roth and Frank, 1989 ). IFN has also been shown to directly inhibit thymidine incorporation into the DNA of normal cells, including both lymphoid and epithelial cells, in the absence of mitogenic stimulation (Brouty-Boye and Tovey, 1978; Stadler et al., 1986; Roth and Frank, 1989) . Although the suppressive mechanism (s) associated with rHuIFN-c~ on DNA synthesis and lymphocyte blastogenesis were not investigated in our study, it is possible that high doses of IFN in vitro enhanced lectin-binding on lymphocytes and stimulated suppressor cell activities. IFN can markedly enhance the binding of lectins to lymphocyte membranes (Miorner et al., 1978) , and suppressor cells are activated by high doses of mitogen, particularly Con A (Piguet et al., 1976) . The IFN-mediated suppression of lectin-induced blastogenesis observed when feline PBL were preincubated 24 h with relatively high doses of rHuIFNa was also seen 24 h after cats were inoculated i.m. with very high doses (106 U/kg) of rHuIFN-a. Significant decreases in blastogenic responses to T-cell mitogens (Con A) in particular were observed after parenteral administration of high-dose rHuIFN-a. Although responses to PWM (which acts both as a B-and T-cell mitogen) (Heegaard and Muller, 1988) were diminished, this effect was not statistically significant, suggesting that T-cell responses perhaps were somewhat more sensitive to the suppressive actions of high doses of IFN in vivo. Curiously, lower parenteral doses of rHuIFN-a (104-102 U/kg) significantly enhanced the blastogenic responses of PBL after stimulation with T-cell mitogens (this phenomenon, however, was not observed when low doses of IFN were incubated in vitro with PBL). An inverse relationship between IFN dose and lymphocyte proliferative responses similar to that which we observed in cats has been documented previously in vitro and in vivo in mice and persons (Miorner et al., 1978; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1980; Kim, 1988) . Seemingly, a mechanism associated with this phenomenon may have been IFNinduced activation of suppressor cells. Bielefeldt-Ohmann and Babiuk (1986) reported that in vitro treatment of bovine PBL with recombinant bovine IFNgamma (rBoIFN-7) induced suppressor cells which may have competed with interleukin (IL)-2; moreover, the suppression in lymphocyte blastogenesis after in vivo administration of high doses of rBoIFN-7 was found to be reversible by addition of human IL-2 to the lymphocyte cultures. Lower amounts of IFN, however, may actually enhance the cellular immune response by selectively blocking suppressor pathways (Knop et al., 1984) . In support of this theory, Daurat et al. (1988) demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic activities of allospecific T-cells and enhanced cytotoxic responses of NK cells in mice inoculated several times with IFN-a, fl at dosages as low as 2.0 or 2 × 10-lo U. The inverse dose-response effects of IFN, particularly its biologic activity at very low pharmacologic doses, has suggested a predominantly hormone-like action of IFN as a homeostatic regulator of immune functions (Daurat et al., 1988) . Undoubtedly, an understanding of the dose-response effects of IFN on normal feline immune responses is imperative when considering IFN therapy in cats with disease. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies on the effects of IFN on T-and also B-cell responses in cats will be required so that specific recommendations concerning the use of IFN in feline viral or other diseases rationally can be established.",
         "Effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha in vitro and in vivo on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis in cats(). The effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-α) in vitro and in vivo on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free cats. Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 10(4) or 10(3) International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10(−3) U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 10(4)–10(2) U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-(3)H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 10(4) U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (10(6) U/kg), moderate dose (10(4) U/kg), or a relatively low dose (10(2) U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 10(6) U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 10(4) or 10(2) U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-α given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing.. gen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free cats. Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 104 or 103 International Units (U) of rHuIFN-o~ for 24 h significantly suppressed (P < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10-10 -3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 104-102 U (P < 0.001 ) or 10 U (P< 0.05) of rHuIFN-o~/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-o~ doses of 104 U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-~ in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose ( 106 U/kg), moderate dose ( 104 U/kg), or a relatively low dose ( l0 s U/kg) of rHuIFN-ol. Cats inoculated with 108 U of rHuIFN-~fkg had significantly reduced (P = 0.037 ) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-o~/kg significantly enhanced (P--0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-o! given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing. INTRODUCTION Interferons (IFN) are a group of cellular proteins that inhibit viral replication, modulate immune responses, inhibit normal cellular division and have antitumor activity (Borden and Ball, 1981 ) . There are several classes of IFN ( a, fl and y) which differ on the basis of their antigenic, biological and physic ochemical properties (Mannering and Deloria, 1986) . Because IFN (particularly human IFN-c~ ) has antiviral and immunomodulatory activities that cross species lines (Pallikoff et al., 1962; Desmyter et al., 1968; Gresser et al., 1974; Krakowka et al., 1988) and because recombinant DNA-produced human IFN is now available in relatively large quantity, the use of human IFN in veterinary medicine has increased. Human IFN-c~ has been used clinically in cattle afflicted with respiratory diseases (Roney et al., 1985; Cummins and Hutcheson, 1986) , in cats infected with either feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) , and in dogs infected with canine parvovirus (Dr. J. Cummins, unpublished data, 1986) . Dosages of IFN used clinically in domestic animals have been empirical and extrapolated largely from studies in persons or mice using interferon preparations that can differ in purity and potency. Unfortunately, studies of the immunological effects of homologous or heterologous IFN in domestic animals have been lacking; the effects of human IFN-c~ in vitro on canine immune responses, however, have recently been reported (Krakowka et al., 1988) . Our interest in studying IFN is related to its application clinically as an antiviral and immunomodulating drug in cats with viral diseases. The effects of heterologous IFNs on feline immune responses in general are not known. Resistance to diseases such as FIP is associated with effective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985; ; cats infected with other viruses like FeLV may have severely impaired T-cell responses (Rojko and Olsen, 1984 ) . Obviously, an understanding of the relationship between IFN dosage and modulation of CMI is necessary prior to recommending IFN as treatment for viral diseases where stimulation of CMI is required. Mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis, which is a widely used in vitro assay for evaluation of CMI (Oppenheim and Schechter, 1976) , has been used previously in cats to assess alterations in CMI induced by immunomodulating agents such as cyclosporin (Gregory et al., 1987 ) . In the studies reported here, the effects of doses of human IFN-c~ in vitro and in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis in normal cats was investigated. The cats used in these studies were healthy, 10-12-month-old specific-path-ogen-free (SPF) males and females, weighing approximately 3.5 kg. The cats were purchased from a commercial breeder (Liberty Laboratories, Liberty Corners, NJ ) and were FeLV test-negative (by ELISA) and feline coronavirus antibody-negative prior to the studies. The cats were housed separately in cages located in the Scott-Ritchey Animal Isolation Facility and were tested and cared for according to humane standards as set forth in the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (Publication No. 85-23, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All experimental protocols were approved by an independent animal welfare committee prior to the studies. The recombinant DNA-derived (Bgl-II restriction endonuclease-specified) human leukocyte (alpha) hybrid {subtypes A/D) IFN (rHuIFN-a), lot no. RO-23-1740, was kindly supplied by Dr. Richard Cordts, Hoffman LaRoche, Nutley, NJ. The IFN was stored lyophilized (at a concentration of 50X 106 International Units (U)/vial) at -80°C prior to use. The IFN was diluted before use in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; pH 7.2) and was sterilefiltered through a 0.2 ]~M cellulose acetate membrane (Nalge Co, Rochester, NY ). The biological activity of the rHuIFN-c~ (expressed in U/ml of antiviral activity) was determined in the manufacturer's laboratory, using an international reference standard for human leukocyte IFN. Cats were lightly anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (Vetalar; Parke, Davis & Co, Detroit, MI) and blood collected by jugular venipuncture into glass syringes containing heparin (10 units/ml of blood). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated and prepared as previously described (Cockerell et al., 1975; Tham et al., 1982) . Briefly, PBL were separated by Ficoll-diatrizoate (Histopaque-1077; Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) gradient separation and the interface mononuclear cells collected and washed in HBSS. The washed cells were resuspended to 2 X 106 viable cells/ml in tissue culture growth medium (GM) consisting of RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin/ml and 100/lg of streptomycin/ml along with 1.0 mM L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES. For the in vitro IFN studies, PBL (2.0 X 105 cells, 0.1 ml) were pipetted into wells of sterile 96-well flat-bottom microtitration plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and then incubated with GM containing varying amounts of rHuIFN-a or GM only (0.1 ml/well) for 24 h at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. For the in vivo studies, preincubation of PBL with IFN was omitted. The cell suspensions were then cultured 72 h with either concanavalin A (Con A) (0.6 ttg/well) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) (0.5 ttg/well), or they were not treated with mitogens (6 replicates/treatment). Previous titrations in feline PBL indicated that the concentrations of mitogen used were optimal for our assay. To each well, 0.5/~Ci (0.025 ml ) of [methyl-3H ]thymidine (specific activity 6.7 Ci/mmol) (Dupont, NEN Research Products, Boston, MA) was added for the last 20 h of incubation. The cultures were then stored at -80 ° C until harvested. Cells were harvested using a semi-automatic multiple cell microharvester (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) so that the cellular proteins were collected onto glass fiber filter paper strips (Bellco). The paper strips were dried at 60 °C for 30 min and the filter discs transferred to scintillation vials into which 5 ml of toluene base cocktail (Scinti Verse II; Fischer Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) was added. The incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA was quantitated in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (LKB-Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) using channels ratio method of quench correction. The net counts per minute (c.p.m.) of a total of 6 wells for each variable were averaged to obtain the mean c.p.m. The stimulation index (s.i.) was determined by dividing the mean c.p.m, of the mitogen-stimulated (or rHuIFN-~-stimulated only) cells by the mean c.p.m, of unstimulated (media control) cells. Stock solutions of IFN, thymidine and fetal calf serum were prepared from the same lots, respectively, prior to the studies and only fresh reagents were used. To determine the potential cytotoxic effect of rHuIFN-c~ on feline PBL, lymphocytes were isolated from eight normal cats as described before and were exposed to varying amounts of rHuIFN-c~ continuously for several days. Briefly, freshly isolated PBL (2.0 × 105 cells, 0.1 ml) were cultured with GM (0.1 ml/ well) containing rHuIFN-c~ (ranges, 104-1.0 U/ml) or GM only for 96 h at 37°C in 96-well microtitration plates (6 replicates/dose). The nonadherent cells were aspirated from a total of 6 wells for each IFN dose; the number of viable cells, determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, were counted in duplicate using a Neubauer hemocytometer. Results were expressed as mean viable cell density (number of viable cells/ml) in rHuIFN-c~-treated or medium control cultures. A study was designed to evaluate the effects of giving varying amounts of rHuIFN-c~ parenterally on lymphocyte blastogenesis in cats. Cats were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups and were treated as follows: a high-dose IFN group (n= 10 cats) received a single injection i.m. of rHuIFN-~ at a dosage of 106 U/kg; a moderate-dose IFN group (n=4 cats) likewise received 104 U of rHuIFN-c~/kg; and a low-dose IFN group (n=4 cats) similarly received 102 U of rHuIFN-c~/kg. Three additional cats were inoculated similarly with HBSS (diluent controls). Cats were evaluated by lymphocyte blastogenesis in response to phytomitogens at 24 h postinoculation. In order to minimize normal diurnal variation in test results, all cats were evaluated by lymphocyte blastogenesis at 24-h intervals on 3 successive days preceding inoculation and then 24 h postinoculation. For each group of cats, a single preinoculation mean Con A or PWM response (3-day average) was determined and then compared statistically against the corresponding postinoculation group mean. Each group of cats was evaluated separately on alternate weeks. The one-tailed Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance between groups. All data analysis was performed using a computerized statistical analysis program (Abstat; Anderson-Bell, Canon City, CO). A conservative number of degrees of freedom was used (i.e., one for each animal rather than one for each well). P values of ~< 0.05 were considered significant. Incubation of normal feline PBL with doses of rHuIFN-a in vitro suppressed lymphocyte proliferative responses to Con A and PWM (Table 1) . Suppression of blastogenesis was dose-dependent; significant inhibition occurred at relatively high in vitro doses of rHuIFN-c~ (104 or 103 U/ml). Doses of 102 U of rHuIFN-c~/ml also decreased mean Con A or PWM responses, but this effect was not statistically significant. Lower doses of rHuIFN-a (10.0-10-3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. Incorporation of [methyl-3H ] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA in the absence of phytomitogens was significantly inhibited in feline PBL cultures exposed to rHuIFN-~ doses of 104-10.0 U/ml compared to untreated PBL (Table 2) . Mean thymidine incorporation (c.p.m.) in cultures treated with 104-102 or with 10.0 U/ml was approximately 14% or 50%, respectively, of the thymidine incorporation measured in untreated cells. Varying amounts of rHuIFN-c~ (104-1.0 U/ml) were added to PBL cultures to determine whether direct cytotoxic effects from the IFN itself may have contributed to the dose-related suppression of blastogenesis observed in vitro. Differences in mean viable cell density between untreated PBL cultures and those treated with IFN, however, were not observed. (Fig. 1) .  To determine the effects of varying amounts of rHuIFN-a in vivo on mitogen-induced blastogenesis, cats in each of three groups were given a single injection of either a high (106 U/kg), moderate (104 U/kg), or relatively low dose (102 U/kg) of rHuIFN-~ and then evaluated 24 h later. To minimize normal diurnal variation in responses, a 3-day average of daily mean responses was determined preinoculation for each group. Day-to-day variation in blastogenic responses of individual cats evaluated on 3 consecutive days of the same week was not significant (P > 0.05, n---18; data not shown). Cats inoculated with a single high dose of rHuIFN-~ had a significant suppression (P= 0.037) in Con A-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values ( Fig. 2A) . Mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast to the cats inoculated with a high dose of rHuIFN-~, cats given 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-c~/kg had significantly enhanced (P=0.008 or 0.05, respectively) blastogenic responses to Con A; PWM responses, however, were unaffected ( Fig. 2B and C ) . Inoculation of cats with HBSS alone had no significant effect on mitogen-induced blastogenesis 24 h postinoculation (data not shown). The effects of IFN in vitro or in vivo on the immune system are manyfold and sometimes apparently contradictory. Overall, it appears that IFN can either stimulate or suppress various arms of the immune response, depending on the timing of administration and dosage (Epstein, 1977) . IFN in general seems to inhibit immunologic responses when given prior to an immunogen but enhances responses if given some days later (White and Fenner, 1986) . Moreover, high doses of IFN can produce opposite effects or annul the responses obtained with much lower doses. For example, very low doses of IFN-c~ in vitro or in vivo may stimulate development of antibody-forming spleen cells in mice, whereas high doses are immunosuppressive (Braun and Levy, 1972; Epstein, 1977) . The addition of low doses of IFN (10 or 100 units/ml) in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction increases the cytotoxic response in mice severalfold, but larger doses (104 units/ml ) depress the response (Fradelizi and Gresser, 1982 ) . Similarly, low doses of IFN can enhance lymphocyte blastogenesis in mice or persons, whereas large doses are suppressive (Miorner et al., 1978; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1980) . Depending on the timing of administration, extremely low doses of IFN-~, fl (2 × 10-lO U) in mice significantly increase the number of antibody-secreting cells in spleen and strongly stimulate cytotoxic activities of allospecific T-cells (Daurat et al., 1988) . The results-of this study showed that very high doses of rHuIFN-~ either in vitro or in vivo suppressed mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses in cats. The rHuIFN-~ also directly inhibited the in vitro incorporation of [methyl-3H ]thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA of unstimulated PBL and at much lower IFN concentrations than those required to suppress mitogen-induced blastogenesis. The inhibitory effects of various types of IFN on DNA synthesis and lymphocyte blastogenesis after mitogenic stimulation have been described previously in different species, including mice, cattle, and persons (Lindahl-Magnusson et al., 1972; Blomgren et al., 1974; Bielefeldt-Ohman and Babiuk, 1986; Kim et al., 1988; Roth and Frank, 1989 ). IFN has also been shown to directly inhibit thymidine incorporation into the DNA of normal cells, including both lymphoid and epithelial cells, in the absence of mitogenic stimulation (Brouty-Boye and Tovey, 1978; Stadler et al., 1986; Roth and Frank, 1989) . Although the suppressive mechanism (s) associated with rHuIFN-c~ on DNA synthesis and lymphocyte blastogenesis were not investigated in our study, it is possible that high doses of IFN in vitro enhanced lectin-binding on lymphocytes and stimulated suppressor cell activities. IFN can markedly enhance the binding of lectins to lymphocyte membranes (Miorner et al., 1978) , and suppressor cells are activated by high doses of mitogen, particularly Con A (Piguet et al., 1976) . The IFN-mediated suppression of lectin-induced blastogenesis observed when feline PBL were preincubated 24 h with relatively high doses of rHuIFNa was also seen 24 h after cats were inoculated i.m. with very high doses (106 U/kg) of rHuIFN-a. Significant decreases in blastogenic responses to T-cell mitogens (Con A) in particular were observed after parenteral administration of high-dose rHuIFN-a. Although responses to PWM (which acts both as a B-and T-cell mitogen) (Heegaard and Muller, 1988) were diminished, this effect was not statistically significant, suggesting that T-cell responses perhaps were somewhat more sensitive to the suppressive actions of high doses of IFN in vivo. Curiously, lower parenteral doses of rHuIFN-a (104-102 U/kg) significantly enhanced the blastogenic responses of PBL after stimulation with T-cell mitogens (this phenomenon, however, was not observed when low doses of IFN were incubated in vitro with PBL). An inverse relationship between IFN dose and lymphocyte proliferative responses similar to that which we observed in cats has been documented previously in vitro and in vivo in mice and persons (Miorner et al., 1978; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1980; Kim, 1988) . Seemingly, a mechanism associated with this phenomenon may have been IFNinduced activation of suppressor cells. Bielefeldt-Ohmann and Babiuk (1986) reported that in vitro treatment of bovine PBL with recombinant bovine IFNgamma (rBoIFN-7) induced suppressor cells which may have competed with interleukin (IL)-2; moreover, the suppression in lymphocyte blastogenesis after in vivo administration of high doses of rBoIFN-7 was found to be reversible by addition of human IL-2 to the lymphocyte cultures. Lower amounts of IFN, however, may actually enhance the cellular immune response by selectively blocking suppressor pathways (Knop et al., 1984) . In support of this theory, Daurat et al. (1988) demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic activities of allospecific T-cells and enhanced cytotoxic responses of NK cells in mice inoculated several times with IFN-a, fl at dosages as low as 2.0 or 2 × 10-lo U. The inverse dose-response effects of IFN, particularly its biologic activity at very low pharmacologic doses, has suggested a predominantly hormone-like action of IFN as a homeostatic regulator of immune functions (Daurat et al., 1988) . Undoubtedly, an understanding of the dose-response effects of IFN on normal feline immune responses is imperative when considering IFN therapy in cats with disease. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies on the effects of IFN on T-and also B-cell responses in cats will be required so that specific recommendations concerning the use of IFN in feline viral or other diseases rationally can be established.",

         "Short-term Follow-up Results of Drug-eluting Stenting in Premature Coronary Artery Disease Patients with Multiple Atherosclerotic Risk Factors",
         "BACKGROUND: Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) is a special entity with a strong link to familial hypercholesterolemia, family history of premature CAD, or multiple coexistent atherosclerotic risk factors. Drug-eluting stenting (DES), including paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stenting (SES), has been proven to have a lower restenotic rate. However, to date, few studies have investigated the clinical and angiographic results of DES in premature CAD patients. METHODS: Between February 2004 and October 2005, premature CAD patients, defined as those younger than 50 years ofage, who were treated with DES in our medical center were all retrospectively enrolled. Their baseline clinical characteristics, clinical outcome and angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients (M/F: 23/3) were enrolled, with a mean age of 44 ±6 years (range, 24–50 years). Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent in this study group, including diabetes mellitus (35%), hypertension (35%), hyperlipidemia (54%) and smoking (73%). Moreover, there was 1 homozygous and 1 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia case in our study group. In terms of angiographic results, there were 40 target lesions in 34 target vessels. Forty DES (39 PES, 1 SES) were implanted with a median stent diameter of 3 mm and median length of 24 mm. The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006, with a mean follow-up duration of 540 ±168 days; 11 (42%) patients had a second angiogram during the follow-up period (200 ±98 days after DES). None of the patients had target lesion revascularization (TLR). In addition, there was no difference in TLR or stent thrombosis between patients with or without acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSION: Based on our single-center experience, DES had good short-term follow-up results for a premature CAD group with diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.",

         "Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) patients are a special subgroup among atherosclerotic patients. Premature presentation implies a rapidly progressive disease course. Moreover, the impact of premature myocardial infarction (MI) or CAD on the young patient and his/her family is particularly devastating. Fortunately, the incidence of MI and symptomatic CAD in young adults is low; most studies show that only about 3% of all CAD cases occur under the age of 40. 1, 2 The fact that clinically manifest CAD in the young adult is relatively uncommon implies that these patients are atypical of the general population. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Cigarette smoking has been shown to be the single factor most strongly associated with CAD in young adults. 9 Kannel et al found that in patients included in the Framingham Ming-Hsiung Wang 1,2 , Wen-Lieng Lee 1,3 , Kuo-Yang Wang 1,4 , Yu-Cheng Hsieh 1,3 , Tsun-Jui Liu 1,3 , I-Hsiang Lin 1,5 , Wei-Wen Lin 1 , Chih-Tai Ting 1,3 , Kae-Woei Liang 1,3 * Heart Study, the relative risk for CAD was about 3 times higher in smokers aged 35-44 compared to nonsmokers in the same age group. 9, 10 Diabetes and hyperlipidemia are also important associated risk factors in premature CAD patients. Family history of CAD is another known risk factor and probably represents a combination of multiple risk factors. Drug-eluting stenting (DES) has been shown to have a lower restenotic rate in comparison with baremetal stenting. 11, 12 Recently, several clinical trials and registries have proven the efficacy of DES in highrisk subsets such as diabetes, small vessels or long lesions. [13] [14] [15] However, few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of DES for premature CAD patients, who are usually associated with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors. We conducted this retrospective study and investigated the short-term results of DES in premature CAD patients with diverse and multiple risk factors. Between February 2004 and October 2005, premature CAD patients, defined as those younger than 50 years of age, who were treated with DES in Taichung Veterans General Hospital (Taichung, Taiwan) were all retrospectively enrolled. Their clinical characteristics, clinical outcome and angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. Angiographic follow-up was at the discretion of the interventional cardiologists in charge. The clinical follow-up was retrospectively counted up to May 31, 2006. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) included ST elevation or non-ST elevation MI with cardiac enzyme elevation or unstable angina with crescendo chest pain, and ischemic electrocardiographic changes but no cardiac enzyme elevation. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg after multiple measurements in the sitting position at rest or patients already on antihypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting blood sugar over 126 mg/dL on 2 occasions or patients already on oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin shot. Hyperlipidemia was defined as total cholesterol over 200 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) over 130 mg/dL or patients already on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment. Family history of premature CAD was defined as CAD history in a first-degree male relative before the age of 55 or female before the age of 65. Patients received 325 mg of aspirin and a 300-mg oral dose of clopidogrel before or immediately after the procedure. Dual antiplatelet agents were maintained for at least 3 months in sirolimus-eluting stenting (SES) and for 6 months in paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES). The use of either PES or SES was dependent upon mutual agreement between the patient and the interventional cardiologist in charge. Target vessel revascularization (TVR) was considered to be driven by ischemia if the stenosis of the target vessel was at least 50% of the luminal diameter on the basis of a quantitative analysis, with either electrocardiographic changes while the patient was at rest or a functional study indicating ischemia in the distribution of the target vessel, or if there was stenosis of at least 70% in conjunction with recurrent symptoms alone. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) was defined as repeat revascularization for ischemia owing to stenosis of at least 50% of the luminal diameter anywhere within the stent or within the 5-mm borders proximal or distal to the stent. Target vessel failure was defined as death, MI, or ischemiadriven TVR. If an adverse event could not conclusively be attributed to a non-target vessel, the event was considered a target vessel failure. The complete angiogram record was reviewed and angiographic measurements were made on a dedicated workstation with software for quantitative analysis of angiograms (QCA) (Philips Inturis Suite, R2.2). The classification of coronary lesion types was made based on the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Binary restenosis was defined as stenosis of at least 50% diameter of the luminal diameter of previously treated lesions. Stent thrombosis was defined as an ACS with angiographic documentation of either vessel occlusion or thrombus within or adjacent to a previously successfully stented vessel or, in the absence of angiographic confirmation, either acute MI in the distribution of the treated vessel or death from cardiac causes up to the end of the defined study period. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and categorical data as percentages. Categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test with or without Yate's correction as indicated. SPSS version 12.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all calculations. A 2-tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 26 patients (M/F: 23/3) were enrolled, with a mean age of 44 ± 6 years (median age, 45 years; range, 24-50 years). Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent in this study group, including diabetes mellitus (35%), hypertension (35%), hyperlipidemia (54%) and smoking (73%) ( Table 1 ). The mean number of atherosclerotic risk factors was 3 ± 2. In particular, there was 1 homozygous and 1 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patient in our study. The homozygous patient was a 24-year-old woman who presented with baseline total cholesterol 520 mg/dL, tendon xanthomas, left main and triple-vessel coronary disease and carotid atherosclerosis. The heterozygous patient was a 34-year-old man with baseline total cholesterol of 400 mg/dL and triple-vessel coronary disease. There were 40 target lesions in 34 target vessels. Among the 40 lesions, 25 (62.5%) were type C lesions and 24 (60%) had reference vessel diameter < 3 mm. The mean lesion length was 23.1 ± 5.2 mm. Forty DES (39 PES, 1 SES) were implanted, with a median stent diameter of 3 mm and median length of 24 mm (Table 2) . The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006 with a mean follow-up duration of 540 ± 168 days. Drug-eluting stent and premature CAD Eleven (42%) patients had a second angiogram in the follow-up period (200 ± 98 days after DES) and none of them had binary restenosis (Table 3) . Moreover, no patients had TLR in the clinical follow-up period. However, 2 patients (5.9% of intervened vessels) had TVR (non-target lesion) during follow-up. One was a 44-year-old man who had a patent PES site over the proximal obtuse marginal branch on follow-up angiogram but restenosis of the far-distal obtuse marginal ballooning site (beyond the stented segment). The other was a 42-year-old man, who received PES at the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). On follow-up, he had a patent LAD-proximal stented site, but a previously untreated LAD-middle lesion became significant and intervention was subsequently performed with balloon angioplasty. No patients developed stent thrombosis or recurrent acute MI in the clinical follow-up period. Regarding risk factor modification, the 14 patients who met the criteria for hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL or LDL-C > 130 mg/dL) were all put on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment during the clinical follow-up period. Forty-two percent of the original cigarette smokers quit smoking after index percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Sixteen (62%) of the study patients were admitted due to ACS, while 10 (38%) were admitted due to stable angina pectoris. There was no difference in TLR, stent thrombosis or binary restenosis between the ACS and non-ACS groups. Two patients in the ACS group had non-target lesion TVR (p = 0.684 vs. non-ACS) ( Table 4 ). Premature CAD demands special clinical attention because of its devastating impact on patients and their families. 16 DES is gaining popularity among cardiologists because of its effectiveness in reducing the restenosis rate. 11, 12 However, concerns about the increased late or very late stent thrombosis rate in DES have recently arisen. 17, 18 Though several trials and registries have proven the efficacy of DES in the general population, very few studies have focused on DES application in premature CAD groups. In our retrospective study, we showed that DES was a reliable treatment for a premature CAD group with complex lesions and diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors. Our study included 2 rare premature CAD cases with familial hypercholesterolemia. One was a homozygous 24-year-old woman who presented with baseline total cholesterol of 520 mg/dL, tendon xanthomas, left main and triple-vessel coronary disease and carotid artery stenosis. She was treated with both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and plasma LDL apheresis. 19 SES was implanted in the left main ostium and a PES in the right coronary artery. However, no skin biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis by measuring LDL receptor activity in the cultured skin fibroblasts of this patient. 20 Another limitation is that there was no followup coronary angiogram in this case. The other patient was a heterozygous 34-year-old man with baseline total cholesterol of 400 mg/dL, ischemic resting electrocardiogram and strong positive treadmill exercise test results. Coronary angiogram showed triplevessel coronary disease, and he was treated with a total of 5 PES in 2 PCI sessions. A radionuclide exercise myocardial perfusion scan was performed 5 months later that disclosed negative ischemic response on electrocardiography and scan, indicating good therapeutic results. The study was based on a retrospective analysis of a single center's catheterization databank and thus limited by a small sample size. The clinical implications of our study are also limited by the DES brand selected (98% PES) as well as gender bias (88% male). Another limitation is that only 42% of the studied patients had a second coronary angiogram during the follow-up period. Moreover, 35% of studied patients presented with acute MI. According to the literature, young-age acute MI is associated with more thrombus and less plaque and thus an inherent lower restenotic rate. 21 Another shortcoming of this study was the lack of an older-age control group that received DES treatment in the same study time frame. The mean number of atherosclerotic risk factors was 3 ± 2 in our study, and 63% of the treated lesions were ACC/AHA class C. Though most of the treated lesions were complex and the clinical scenarios were high risk for restenosis, our short-term follow-up results disclosed only 2 target vessel failures (5.9%). The results are compatible with most published clinical trials in high-risk subsets. 14, 15 Our study results indicate that young age or premature CAD is not a limitation to DES-based PCI in current practice. Moreover, recent results from the COURAGE trial by Boden et al emphasized the importance of risk factor modification for the treatment of stable angina pectoris. 22 Our study results on young premature CAD subjects again proved this notion as all our patients with hypercholesterolemia were put on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment during the clinical follow-up period. In conclusion, based on our single-center experience, DES was a reliable treatment with a very low TLR (0%) for a premature CAD group with complex lesions and diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.",

Sixteen (62%) of the study patients were admitted due to ACS, while 10 (38%) were admitted due to stable angina pectoris. There was no difference in TLR, stent thrombosis or binary restenosis between the ACS and non-ACS groups. Two patients in the ACS group had non-target lesion TVR (p = 0.684 vs. non-ACS) ( Table 4 ). Premature CAD demands special clinical attention because of its devastating impact on patients and their families. 16 DES is gaining popularity among cardiologists because of its effectiveness in reducing the restenosis rate. 11, 12 However, concerns about the increased late or very late stent thrombosis rate in DES have recently arisen. 17, 18 Though several trials and registries have proven the efficacy of DES in the general population, very few studies have focused on DES application in premature CAD groups. In our retrospective study, we showed that DES was a reliable treatment for a premature CAD group with complex lesions and diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors. Our study included 2 rare premature CAD cases with familial hypercholesterolemia. One was a homozygous 24-year-old woman who presented with baseline total cholesterol of 520 mg/dL, tendon xanthomas, left main and triple-vessel coronary disease and carotid artery stenosis. She was treated with both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and plasma LDL apheresis. 19 SES was implanted in the left main ostium and a PES in the right coronary artery. However, no skin biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis by measuring LDL receptor activity in the cultured skin fibroblasts of this patient. 20 Another limitation is that there was no followup coronary angiogram in this case. The other patient was a heterozygous 34-year-old man with baseline total cholesterol of 400 mg/dL, ischemic resting electrocardiogram and strong positive treadmill exercise test results. Coronary angiogram showed triplevessel coronary disease, and he was treated with a total of 5 PES in 2 PCI sessions. A radionuclide exercise myocardial perfusion scan was performed 5 months later that disclosed negative ischemic response on electrocardiography and scan, indicating good therapeutic results. The study was based on a retrospective analysis of a single center's catheterization databank and thus limited by a small sample size. The clinical implications of our study are also limited by the DES brand selected (98% PES) as well as gender bias (88% male). Another limitation is that only 42% of the studied patients had a second coronary angiogram during the follow-up period. Moreover, 35% of studied patients presented with acute MI. According to the literature, young-age acute MI is associated with more thrombus and less plaque and thus an inherent lower restenotic rate. 21 Another shortcoming of this study was the lack of an older-age control group that received DES treatment in the same study time frame. The mean number of atherosclerotic risk factors was 3 ± 2 in our study, and 63% of the treated lesions were ACC/AHA class C. Though most of the treated lesions were complex and the clinical scenarios were high risk for restenosis, our short-term follow-up results disclosed only 2 target vessel failures (5.9%). The results are compatible with most published clinical trials in high-risk subsets. 14, 15 Our study results indicate that young age or premature CAD is not a limitation to DES-based PCI in current practice. Moreover, recent results from the COURAGE trial by Boden et al emphasized the importance of risk factor modification for the treatment of stable angina pectoris. 22 Our study results on young premature CAD subjects again proved this notion as all our patients with hypercholesterolemia were put on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment during the clinical follow-up period. In conclusion, based on our single-center experience, DES was a reliable treatment with a very low TLR (0%) for a premature CAD group with complex lesions and diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.",

Proteolytic processing of a hormone by a particular enzyme may modulate its biologic functions, and peptide hormones can often be processed by several different proteases, depending on both the access of an enzyme to specific hormones and the presence of substances modulating protease activity. Membrane-bound and soluble proteases may have different enzymatic potencies and different access to peptides as a function of the relative locations of the peptide and the enzyme. Several cell surface antigens defined as leukocyte differentiation markers have been shown to be proteolytic enzymes that are also expressed by epithelium, endothelium, or other tissues, demonstrating that leukocyte differentiation implies a modulation of protease expression, a However, factors involved in these differentiation phenomena are not well understood. Under some pathologic conditions, APNbut not DPP IV-is specifically expressed by mononuclear cells, 2 while activation of alveolar macrophages differentially stimulates the expression of cathepsin D and APN. 3 HIV infection also modifies proteolytic activity. [4] [5] [6] Epithelial cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes are able to express and secrete many hydrolytic enzymes, as well as their inhibitors. Although some information has been gained on the protease-antiprotease imbalance in the lung in emphysema, 7 the regulation of peptidases involved in the metabolism of small peptides has not been extensively evaluated in the pulmonary bronchoalveolar space. In the present study, the enzymatic activities of two aminopeptidases (APN and DPP IV) and a dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (ACE) were measured as soluble enzymes in BAL fluid and as cell-bound enzymes in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B, a non-tumorigenic cell line with a phenotype close to that of a bronchial cells), s alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells, derived from an alveolar type II carcinoma [ATCC]), and bronchoalveolar macrophages. These enzymes were evaluated in the human BAL fluid obtained from normal human male volunteers and from patients with various lung disorders and were compared with cellular reparfition between macrophages, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Study subjects. BAL was performed in 23 nonsmoking male volunteers. Subjects were selected after a thorough questionnaire and clinical examination to exclude those with past or present illness as well as those taking any medication. In addition, pulmonary function tests were performed and subjects with abnormal spirometry or positive methacholine challenge test were excluded. All were nonsmokers. BAL from patients who underwent bronchoscopy for diagnostic purpose were also retrospectively analyzed. Patient populations represented various pathologic conditions including tumors, sarcoidosis, infectious diseases, and AIDS. The study protocol in the normal volunteers was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. No formal request was made for BAL analysis in the patients group because this part of the study was retrospective and because BAL was done primarily for diagnostic purposes. BAL and sample preparation. Bronchoscopy was performed in normal nonsmoldng subjects and patients according to standard procedure. 9 Sterile 0.9% saline solution (150 to 200 ml) was injected in 50 ml aliquots via a fiber optic bronchoscope, was aspirated, and was filtered through sterile gauze. In the volunteers the lavage was done exclusively in a subsegment of the right middle lobe. Because the recovery and time of contact of the injected liquid may be an important parameter that influences the results, these parameters were maintained in as standardized a fashion as possible in the volunteer study. Total recovered cells and differential cell counts were determined on an aliquot sample and treated as cell cultures (below). The remaining cells and fluid were separated by centrifugation. Aliquots of supernatants were frozen at -80 ° C. In the volunteer study, macrophages were isolated by adhesion on plastic for 2 hours in RPMI (Gibco) medium containing 5% FCS. Differential cell counts were performed after concentration by filtration through Millipore (5 Ixm, SMWP 02500) membranes and hematoxylin-light green or Giemsa staining. Enzymatic activities were measured in 150 p~l (APN and DPP IV) or 200 p.1 (ACE) of supernatants as described below. Blood was withdrawn at the time of lavage in the volunteer study, and aliquots of serum were frozen. Six broad disorder categories were defined as follows: (1) sarcoidosis of any stage, diagnosed with lung biopsy or with a characteristic BAL cellular profile; (2) interstitial pneumopathy of any origin, where the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was reasonably excluded; (3) pulmonary infections in immunocompetent patients; (4) pulmonary infections in HIV-positive patients (any stage); (5) primary or secondary lung neoplasm; (6) blood malignancy of the myeloid or the lymphoid lineage. Cell culture. BEAS-2B cells (obtained from Dr. C. C. Harris, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.) were grown in collagen-, fibronectin-, and albumin-coated flasks in LCH-9 serum-free medium as described. 8 A549 cells were from ATCC and were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco). After reaching confluence, cells were washed twice with PBS, detached in PBS with a rubber policeman, and lysed with 2 cycles of sonication/freezing. Adherent macrophages from normal volunteers were treated as cell cultures. Enzymatic activities were measured in 40 ixl (APN and DPPIV) or 100 ~1 (ACE) cell extracts as described below. AminopeptMase activities. For in situ enzymatic activities, an aliquot of BAL cell suspension from t3AL was concentrated by centrifngation onto a glass slide (cytocentrifugation) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 ° C with leu-2-methoxy-L-naphthylamide or gly-pro-2-methoxy-Lnaphthylamide (Bachem) substrates for APN and DPP IV, respectively, at a final concentration of 1 mmolfL in PBS buffer and 1.4 mmol/L Fast Blue BB (Sigma) as previously described. 1° Soluble enzymatic determinations. Leu-and gly-pro-p-  Macrophage-specific monoclonal anti-CD68 antibody was from a commercial source (Dako) and was used at a 1:200 dilution. The anti-human ACE monoclonal antibody 9B9 was a gift of SM Danilov (INSERM U367, Paris). The characterization of this antibody has been described. 13 Lyophilized antibody was dissolved in water (1 mg/ml) and used at a 1:150 dilution in PBS. BAL cells were concentrated by centrifugation, and smears were prepared. Smears were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), washed in PBS, blocked for 15 minutes with normal goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4 ° C with the primary antibody. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse immunoglogulin (Dako) was added for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine (0.035%). For control slides, the primary antibody was omitted. Statistical evaluation. Results were expressed as the mean _+ SEM. Statistical significance was assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient (r) with a two-tailed unpaired Student t test (t) or a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni, with post-test correction. For comparisons between normal volunteers and selected pathologic states, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used, followed by Dunn's Q analysis, where applicable. In this study, 23 normal male volunteers and a collective of randomly selected frozen BAL samples were retrospectively studied without preliminary selection of patients and pathologic states. For further analysis from this collective, known smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with AIDS were selected. In addition, a selection of patients in whom a welldocumented diagnostic was available was specifically analyzed. Clinical data from the normal volunteers and these selected patients are summarized in Table I . Cell repartition between macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils was within the normal values in the normal volunteers. BAL supernatants obtained from normal volunteers (Table II) and from patients with various pathologic conditions (Table III) specifically expressed ACE, APN, and DPP IV activities. In the patient population, dipeptidase activity on his-leu was controled to ensure that low levels of ACE activity were not caused by his-leu degradation (Table III) . To compare ACE, APN, and DPP IV kinetic properties in BAL fluid and plasma, the effect of the specific inhibitors lisinopril, actinonin, and diprotin A, respectively, was analyzed. Lisinopril inhibited the enzymatic activity of the soluble ACE in two BAL and two blood samples (Fig. 1, A) . The respective ICs0 values were 0.2 rtmol/L for the enzyme from the blood and 0.5 txmol/L for the enzyme from the BAL fluid. However, the K M values (0.08 mmol/L) measured in controlled CF concentration from the x-axis intercept of the Lineweaver and Burk plot and substrate inhibition (starting at 0.5 mmol/L substrate concentration), a characteristic of many carboxypeptidases including ACE, 14 were identical for the enzymes of blood and bronchoalveolar origin. The amount of inhibitor necessary to inhibit half of the activity (IC50) of both serum and BAL ACE activities was higher than postulated by the inhibition constants. This can be explained by the high substrate concentration necessary for evaluation of ACE in vitro, because it has been shown that inhibition decreases with a high S/K M ratio) 2 '15 ACE activities between serum and BAL supernatants (n = 23, r = 0.08) and between BAL supernatants and BAL cell extracts (n = 22, r = 0.08) from the normal volunteers were not correlated. In the patient population, soluble ACE activity was increased when lymphocyte content in the BAL was increased (p < 0.05) ( Table IV) , independent of the number of granulocytes. Actinonin and diprotin A similarly inhibited blood and BAL enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B) . APN activity was inhibited by actinonin in BAL fluid (1.12 U/ml) and serum (9.88 U/ml) (Fig. 2, A) , and DPP IV activity was inhibited by diprotin A in BAL fluid (1.14 U/ml) and serum (20,43 U/ml) (Fig. 2, B) with ICs0 values of 0.5 p, mol/L and 7 txmol/L, respectively. In the patient population, soluble APN activity was markedly elevated when the relative proportion of granulocytes was increased (Table IV) , and that of DPP IV was slightly elevated when an increased proportion of lymphocytes was observed (Table IV) , independent of the number of granulocytes, whereas these activities were not measurable in samples with normal cellular repartition. However, no strict correlation between BAL cellular composition and supernatant enzyme activities could be observed. In some BAL fluid containing a determination. Two normal serum samples or two lavage supernatants were preincubated for 10 minutes at 37 ° with decreasing concentrations of lisinopril; substrate was then added, and ACE activity was determined as described. B, K M determination. Decreasing concentrations of z-phe-his-leu were added to either two normal serum samples or to two supernatants of BAL, and ACE activity was measured. The arrow indicates substrate inhibition. very high proportion of either granulocytes or lymphocytes, the activities of APN, ACE, and DPP IV were not elevated. In some samples with high levels of these enzymatic activities, the respective proportions of the corresponding cells were not increased. Some samples with high levels of APN actMty also expressed increased levels of DPP IV, but in other samples, only one of these enzymatic activities was elevated. Thus the relative proportion, or even the absolute number of the three classes of cells evaluated, was not the exclusive factor determining relative levels of enzymatic activity, but other undetermined factors were likely involved. To examine potential clinically relevant factors, we evaluated several distinct groups (clinical data in Table I ) of disorders (Fig. 3, A, B, and C) . Patients with sarcoidosis (Fig. 3 , A, group B) had significantly elevated levels of ACE activity, but an elevated level of this enzyme was also found in patients with blood malignancy (Fig. 3 , A, group G). A normal level of ACE activity was found in the other pulmonary disorders, including interstitial pneumopathy (sarcoidosis excluded), infection, neoplasia (groups C to F) when comparison was made with normal volunteers (group A). No specific condition could be found for patients with ACE activity values below the normal range. APN activity was increased in some samples of pulmonary infections (Fig. 3, B , groups D and E) and DPP IV activity in some samples in all groups, except for samples from patients with blood malignancies (Fig. 3, C) . In BAL samples from a small group of patients with sarcoidosis (n = 4), APN activity was found to be in the normal range (0.15 U/ml), whereas DPP IV activity was increased (0.55 U/ml) in accordance with results obtained with high lymphocyte counts (Table IV) . To analyze the effects of two known modulators of the immune system, the effect of AIDS pathology or of current smoking (more than 10 cigarettes per day) was evaluated (Table V) . It was concluded that neither condition alone importantly altered the level of the proteolytic enzymes studied. However, smokers did exhibit a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid when compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.05). When the aminopeptidase activities were evaluated in situ in cells from BALs, APN and DPP IV (Fig. 4, A and B) were detected. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal anti-ACE (9B9) and anti-macrophage (CD68) antibodies demonstrated that ACE was expressed by bronchoalveolar macrophages (Fig. 5) . However, the number of cells that stained positive for ACE in smears was not correlated with ACE activity in cell extracts (results not shown). ACE immunostaining was also observed exclusively in macrophages in bronchoalveolar cells obtained from a sample with a high lymphocyte ratio (45% macrophages, 50% lymphocytes, CD4+/CD8 + = 0.3) (not shown). Human epithelial cells both from bronchial (BEAS-2B) and alveolar origin (A549) expressed APN and DPP IV activities as well as -y-GTP (a specific marker of epithelial cells used as an internal control) but not ACE activity. BAL macrophages expressed APN, DPP IV, and ACE activities but not ~-GTP activity (Table VI) .  The role of membrane-bound proteases is not well understood, but it might be linked to hormone metabolism and possibly to cell adhesion and migration. Protease shedding from the membrane is a regulatory mechanism for the degradation of peptides in biologic fluids and in the regulation of cell adhesion. Membrane-bound proteases, although active on small synthetic substrates, are not as efficient on larger natural peptide substrates, which are better hydrolyzed when the enzyme has been released from the membrane. The regulation of proteases involved in the metabolism of peptide hormones in the bronchoalveolar space has not been extensively evaluated in normal situations and in lung disorders. The expression of peptidases either in pulmonary cells or in the supernatants of BALs had been previously shown for a few enzymes. For example, in a rat model, carboxypeptidase M and neutral endopeptidase 24.1116 were released into BAL fluid. However, the evaluation of enzyme activities in bronchoalveolar cells, in supernatants, and in the blood in normal human studies has been performed only for ACE. 17 Our results demonstrate that ACE, APN, and DPP IV were secreted in the human epithelial lining fluid as soluble enzymes and were expressed by specific cells of the bronchoalveolar surface, macrophages (ACE, APN, and DPP IV) and epithelial cells (APN and DPP IV). The absence of correlation between ACE enzymatic activity in BAL supernatants and blood under normal situations suggested an independent regulation in both biologic compartments. This is further confirmed by high levels of APN and DPP IV activities measured under normal situations in the blood and almost undetectable activities in BAL fluid. In normal volunteers and in patients, the activity of ACE was detectable in all samples; however, the activities of APN and DPP IV were very low under normal situations but were dramatically increased in some pathologic samples. ACE (EC 3.4.15.1) is a ubiquitous membranebound ectopeptidase of wide specificity that is able to remove dipeptides and some tripeptides without processing from the carboxyl end of proteins. Its potential substrates include bradykinin, substance P, angiotensin I, and enkephalins. The use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension is sometimes linked to cough, possibly because of an increased bronchial reactivity and a decreased degradation by this enzyme of the proinflammatory peptides bradykinin or substance p.18 Interestingly, we found a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid from smokers than in that from other groups. Because ACE is involved in bradykinin degradation, this might have potentially important implications for the effect of smoking on peptide metabolism. Serum ACE activity is increased in active sarcoidosis, HIV, and hyperthyroidism, s'19-21 We did not find increased levels of this enzyme in the BAL fluid from patients with HIV, confirming the differential regulation of this enzyme in both compartments. The level of ACE activity was significantly increased in samples with high lymphocyte counts and in the BAL from patients with sarcoidosis, confirming previous results, 22 or lymphoid neoplasm, a new finding. In normal samples, ACE antigenicity was expressed only in macrophages. Several of the cell-surface antigens of the cluster differentiation system have emerged as cell-surface peptidases with a wide distribution. 1 DPP IV (EC 3.4.14.5), a peptidase specific for the release of xaa- pro and xaa-ala dipeptides from the N-terminal end of peptides, is analogous to CD26. DPP IV/CD26 is involved in T cell activation, mainly CD4+ cells, in vivo and in vitro, but is also expressed by epithelia, certain endothelia, and platelets. 1'23'24 The expression of DPP IV has been shown in bronchoalveolar macrophages 2s but not in BEAS-2B cells. 26 In the present study we found low levels of DPP IV activity in the same cell line and in A549 cells. This discrepancy may be explained by different methods of dos-age or by differences in the confluence of cultures, because we found that the expression of DPP IV activity was dependent on cell confluence in various epithelial cell lines (unpublished experiments). The number of CD26+,CD4 ÷ cells is decreased during HIV infection; however, the activity of DPP IV/CD26 is unchanged in the blood of patients with A I D S . 27 We observed the same lack of relationship in the BAL fluid. DPP IV activity was slightly increased, and independently of the presence of pely- Fig. 5 .

C, Negative control obtained without primary antibodies. morphonuclear cells, when the lymphocyte proportion was increased in BAL, but neither AIDS nor smoking by themselves importantly modified DPP IV activity in BAL fluid. Although no physiologic substrate for DPP IV has yet been formally identified, many important peptides including substance P and several cytokines or peptides derived fi'om collagen are all potential substrates. APN (EC 3.4.11.2) is analogous to CD13 and is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes; intestinal, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal epithelial tissue; some endothelia; and fibroblasts. This exopeptidase can release neutral amino acids from the N-terminal end of peptides, and a function has been postulated for APN in the modulation of activity of peptides and in tumor invasion and collagen degradation. 28 APN expression is regulated by biologically active peptides or by the state of cell differentiation. 29 T lymphocytes appear to be involved in the induction of APN in monocytes in a manner similar to that with ACE. 3° CD13-positive cells are permissive for cytomegalovirus infection. 31 Human APN has been shown to be a receptor for two human corona viruses from the gastrointestinal tract and human lung fibroblasts. 32 '33 In BAL fluid, we show that soluble APN activity was linked to an increased proportion of polymorphonuclear cells. However, actinonin, a relatively specific inhibitor of APN, could not completely inhibit the hydrolysis of leu-p-nitroanilide in BAL samples and in serum. Several explanations can be postulated. First, several enzymes act on the substrate, and each has a different sensitivity to actinonin inhibition. Second, the kinetic of inhibitor binding to enzyme(s) may be complex, which may explain an incomplete inhibition. Third, the hydrolysis of small substrates is still possible for some enzymes, even in the presence of bound inhibitors. The present approach did not allow us to differentiate these possibilities, and more detailed enzymatic analysis would be necessary to answer these questions. In the normal volunteer population, only very low levels of soluble APN and DPP IV activities could be detected, whereas bronchial BEAS-2B and alveolar A549 epithelial cells and bronchoalveolar macrophages expressed high levels of APN. However, in some pathologic states, such as infectious states, much higher amounts of active enzymes were present in soluble form in the epithelial lining fluid, indicating that shedding of these proteases from cell membrane occurs in disease. From the specific expression of these enzymes, APN and DPP IV activities may originate from both macrophages or epithelial cells, as well as endothelial cells, whereas Juillerat-Jeanneref, Aubert, and Leuenberger 613 ACE may originate only from macrophages or endothelial cells, where the expression of this enzyme is established. However, in some diseases, nonspecific diffusion from serum cannot be excluded. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that specific aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases were released as soluble enzymes in high amounts in some pulmonary pathologic states, either from bronchoalveolar structures or from immunocompetent cells of the bronchoalveolar layers, or from both. The observation that increased expression of these enzymes can be measured in some samples of any pathologic disorder limits their usefulness as diagnostic tools. Drugs able to modulate the APN/ CD13 and DPP IV/CD26 activities, in addition to inhibitors of ACE activity, may be potentially interesting in studying the metabolism of important peptide hormones.",
         "Peptidases in human bronchoalveolar lining fluid, macrophages, and epithelial cells: Dipeptidyl (amino)peptidase IV, aminopeptidase N, and dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (angiotensin-converting enzyme)().

Several cell surface antigens defined as leukocyte differentiation markers have been shown to be proteolytic enzymes that are also expressed by epithelium, endothelium, or other tissues, demonstrating that leukocyte differentiation implies a modulation of protease expression, a However, factors involved in these differentiation phenomena are not well understood. Under some pathologic conditions, APNbut not DPP IV-is specifically expressed by mononuclear cells, 2 while activation of alveolar macrophages differentially stimulates the expression of cathepsin D and APN. 3 HIV infection also modifies proteolytic activity. [4] [5] [6] Epithelial cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes are able to express and secrete many hydrolytic enzymes, as well as their inhibitors. Although some information has been gained on the protease-antiprotease imbalance in the lung in emphysema, 7 the regulation of peptidases involved in the metabolism of small peptides has not been extensively evaluated in the pulmonary bronchoalveolar space. In the present study, the enzymatic activities of two aminopeptidases (APN and DPP IV) and a dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (ACE) were measured as soluble enzymes in BAL fluid and as cell-bound enzymes in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B, a non-tumorigenic cell line with a phenotype close to that of a bronchial cells), s alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells, derived from an alveolar type II carcinoma [ATCC]), and bronchoalveolar macrophages. These enzymes were evaluated in the human BAL fluid obtained from normal human male volunteers and from patients with various lung disorders and were compared with cellular reparfition between macrophages, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Study subjects. BAL was performed in 23 nonsmoking male volunteers. Subjects were selected after a thorough questionnaire and clinical examination to exclude those with past or present illness as well as those taking any medication. In addition, pulmonary function tests were performed and subjects with abnormal spirometry or positive methacholine challenge test were excluded. All were nonsmokers. BAL from patients who underwent bronchoscopy for diagnostic purpose were also retrospectively analyzed. Patient populations represented various pathologic conditions including tumors, sarcoidosis, infectious diseases, and AIDS. The study protocol in the normal volunteers was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. No formal request was made for BAL analysis in the patients group because this part of the study was retrospective and because BAL was done primarily for diagnostic purposes. BAL and sample preparation. Bronchoscopy was performed in normal nonsmoldng subjects and patients according to standard procedure. 9 Sterile 0.9% saline solution (150 to 200 ml) was injected in 50 ml aliquots via a fiber optic bronchoscope, was aspirated, and was filtered through sterile gauze. In the volunteers the lavage was done exclusively in a subsegment of the right middle lobe. Because the recovery and time of contact of the injected liquid may be an important parameter that influences the results, these parameters were maintained in as standardized a fashion as possible in the volunteer study. Total recovered cells and differential cell counts were determined on an aliquot sample and treated as cell cultures (below). The remaining cells and fluid were separated by centrifugation. Aliquots of supernatants were frozen at -80 ° C. In the volunteer study, macrophages were isolated by adhesion on plastic for 2 hours in RPMI (Gibco) medium containing 5% FCS. Differential cell counts were performed after concentration by filtration through Millipore (5 Ixm, SMWP 02500) membranes and hematoxylin-light green or Giemsa staining. Enzymatic activities were measured in 150 p~l (APN and DPP IV) or 200 p.1 (ACE) of supernatants as described below. Blood was withdrawn at the time of lavage in the volunteer study, and aliquots of serum were frozen. Six broad disorder categories were defined as follows: (1) sarcoidosis of any stage, diagnosed with lung biopsy or with a characteristic BAL cellular profile; (2) interstitial pneumopathy of any origin, where the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was reasonably excluded; (3) pulmonary infections in immunocompetent patients; (4) pulmonary infections in HIV-positive patients (any stage); (5) primary or secondary lung neoplasm; (6) blood malignancy of the myeloid or the lymphoid lineage. Cell culture. BEAS-2B cells (obtained from Dr. C. C. Harris, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.) were grown in collagen-, fibronectin-, and albumin-coated flasks in LCH-9 serum-free medium as described. 8 A549 cells were from ATCC and were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco). After reaching confluence, cells were washed twice with PBS, detached in PBS with a rubber policeman, and lysed with 2 cycles of sonication/freezing. Adherent macrophages from normal volunteers were treated as cell cultures. Enzymatic activities were measured in 40 ixl (APN and DPPIV) or 100 ~1 (ACE) cell extracts as described below. AminopeptMase activities. For in situ enzymatic activities, an aliquot of BAL cell suspension from t3AL was concentrated by centrifngation onto a glass slide (cytocentrifugation) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 ° C with leu-2-methoxy-L-naphthylamide or gly-pro-2-methoxy-Lnaphthylamide (Bachem) substrates for APN and DPP IV, respectively, at a final concentration of 1 mmolfL in PBS buffer and 1.4 mmol/L Fast Blue BB (Sigma) as previously described. 1° Soluble enzymatic determinations. Leu-and gly-pro-p-  Macrophage-specific monoclonal anti-CD68 antibody was from a commercial source (Dako) and was used at a 1:200 dilution. The anti-human ACE monoclonal antibody 9B9 was a gift of SM Danilov (INSERM U367, Paris). The characterization of this antibody has been described. 13 Lyophilized antibody was dissolved in water (1 mg/ml) and used at a 1:150 dilution in PBS. BAL cells were concentrated by centrifugation, and smears were prepared. Smears were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), washed in PBS, blocked for 15 minutes with normal goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4 ° C with the primary antibody. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse immunoglogulin (Dako) was added for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine (0.035%). For control slides, the primary antibody was omitted. Statistical evaluation. Results were expressed as the mean _+ SEM. Statistical significance was assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient (r) with a two-tailed unpaired Student t test (t) or a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni, with post-test correction. For comparisons between normal volunteers and selected pathologic states, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used, followed by Dunn's Q analysis, where applicable. In this study, 23 normal male volunteers and a collective of randomly selected frozen BAL samples were retrospectively studied without preliminary selection of patients and pathologic states. For further analysis from this collective, known smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with AIDS were selected. In addition, a selection of patients in whom a welldocumented diagnostic was available was specifically analyzed. Clinical data from the normal volunteers and these selected patients are summarized in Table I . Cell repartition between macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils was within the normal values in the normal volunteers. BAL supernatants obtained from normal volunteers (Table II) and from patients with various pathologic conditions (Table III) specifically expressed ACE, APN, and DPP IV activities. In the patient population, dipeptidase activity on his-leu was controled to ensure that low levels of ACE activity were not caused by his-leu degradation (Table III) . To compare ACE, APN, and DPP IV kinetic properties in BAL fluid and plasma, the effect of the specific inhibitors lisinopril, actinonin, and diprotin A, respectively, was analyzed. Lisinopril inhibited the enzymatic activity of the soluble ACE in two BAL and two blood samples (Fig. 1, A) . The respective ICs0 values were 0.2 rtmol/L for the enzyme from the blood and 0.5 txmol/L for the enzyme from the BAL fluid. However, the K M values (0.08 mmol/L) measured in controlled CF concentration from the x-axis intercept of the Lineweaver and Burk plot and substrate inhibition (starting at 0.5 mmol/L substrate concentration), a characteristic of many carboxypeptidases including ACE, 14 were identical for the enzymes of blood and bronchoalveolar origin. The amount of inhibitor necessary to inhibit half of the activity (IC50) of both serum and BAL ACE activities was higher than postulated by the inhibition constants. This can be explained by the high substrate concentration necessary for evaluation of ACE in vitro, because it has been shown that inhibition decreases with a high S/K M ratio) 2 '15 ACE activities between serum and BAL supernatants (n = 23, r = 0.08) and between BAL supernatants and BAL cell extracts (n = 22, r = 0.08) from the normal volunteers were not correlated. In the patient population, soluble ACE activity was increased when lymphocyte content in the BAL was increased (p < 0.05) ( Table IV) , independent of the number of granulocytes. Actinonin and diprotin A similarly inhibited blood and BAL enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B) . APN activity was inhibited by actinonin in BAL fluid (1.12 U/ml) and serum (9.88 U/ml) (Fig. 2, A) , and DPP IV activity was inhibited by diprotin A in BAL fluid (1.14 U/ml) and serum (20,43 U/ml) (Fig. 2, B) with ICs0 values of 0.5 p, mol/L and 7 txmol/L, respectively. In the patient population, soluble APN activity was markedly elevated when the relative proportion of granulocytes was increased (Table IV) , and that of DPP IV was slightly elevated when an increased proportion of lymphocytes was observed (Table IV) , independent of the number of granulocytes, whereas these activities were not measurable in samples with normal cellular repartition. However, no strict correlation between BAL cellular composition and supernatant enzyme activities could be observed. In some BAL fluid containing a determination. Two normal serum samples or two lavage supernatants were preincubated for 10 minutes at 37 ° with decreasing concentrations of lisinopril; substrate was then added, and ACE activity was determined as described. B, K M determination. Decreasing concentrations of z-phe-his-leu were added to either two normal serum samples or to two supernatants of BAL, and ACE activity was measured. The arrow indicates substrate inhibition. very high proportion of either granulocytes or lymphocytes, the activities of APN, ACE, and DPP IV were not elevated. In some samples with high levels of these enzymatic activities, the respective proportions of the corresponding cells were not increased. Some samples with high levels of APN actMty also expressed increased levels of DPP IV, but in other samples, only one of these enzymatic activities was elevated. Thus the relative proportion, or even the absolute number of the three classes of cells evaluated, was not the exclusive factor determining relative levels of enzymatic activity, but other undetermined factors were likely involved. To examine potential clinically relevant factors, we evaluated several distinct groups (clinical data in Table I ) of disorders (Fig. 3, A, B, and C) . Patients with sarcoidosis (Fig. 3 , A, group B) had significantly elevated levels of ACE activity, but an elevated level of this enzyme was also found in patients with blood malignancy (Fig. 3 , A, group G). A normal level of ACE activity was found in the other pulmonary disorders, including interstitial pneumopathy (sarcoidosis excluded), infection, neoplasia (groups C to F) when comparison was made with normal volunteers (group A). No specific condition could be found for patients with ACE activity values below the normal range. APN activity was increased in some samples of pulmonary infections (Fig. 3, B , groups D and E) and DPP IV activity in some samples in all groups, except for samples from patients with blood malignancies (Fig. 3, C) . In BAL samples from a small group of patients with sarcoidosis (n = 4), APN activity was found to be in the normal range (0.15 U/ml), whereas DPP IV activity was increased (0.55 U/ml) in accordance with results obtained with high lymphocyte counts (Table IV) . To analyze the effects of two known modulators of the immune system, the effect of AIDS pathology or of current smoking (more than 10 cigarettes per day) was evaluated (Table V) . It was concluded that neither condition alone importantly altered the level of the proteolytic enzymes studied. However, smokers did exhibit a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid when compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.05). When the aminopeptidase activities were evaluated in situ in cells from BALs, APN and DPP IV (Fig. 4, A and B) were detected. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal anti-ACE (9B9) and anti-macrophage (CD68) antibodies demonstrated that ACE was expressed by bronchoalveolar macrophages (Fig. 5) . However, the number of cells that stained positive for ACE in smears was not correlated with ACE activity in cell extracts (results not shown). ACE immunostaining was also observed exclusively in macrophages in bronchoalveolar cells obtained from a sample with a high lymphocyte ratio (45% macrophages, 50% lymphocytes, CD4+/CD8 + = 0.3) (not shown). Human epithelial cells both from bronchial (BEAS-2B) and alveolar origin (A549) expressed APN and DPP IV activities as well as -y-GTP (a specific marker of epithelial cells used as an internal control) but not ACE activity. BAL macrophages expressed APN, DPP IV, and ACE activities but not ~-GTP activity (Table VI) .  The role of membrane-bound proteases is not well understood, but it might be linked to hormone metabolism and possibly to cell adhesion and migration. Protease shedding from the membrane is a regulatory mechanism for the degradation of peptides in biologic fluids and in the regulation of cell adhesion. Membrane-bound proteases, although active on small synthetic substrates, are not as efficient on larger natural peptide substrates, which are better hydrolyzed when the enzyme has been released from the membrane. The regulation of proteases involved in the metabolism of peptide hormones in the bronchoalveolar space has not been extensively evaluated in normal situations and in lung disorders. The expression of peptidases either in pulmonary cells or in the supernatants of BALs had been previously shown for a few enzymes. For example, in a rat model, carboxypeptidase M and neutral endopeptidase 24.1116 were released into BAL fluid. However, the evaluation of enzyme activities in bronchoalveolar cells, in supernatants, and in the blood in normal human studies has been performed only for ACE. 17 Our results demonstrate that ACE, APN, and DPP IV were secreted in the human epithelial lining fluid as soluble enzymes and were expressed by specific cells of the bronchoalveolar surface, macrophages (ACE, APN, and DPP IV) and epithelial cells (APN and DPP IV). The absence of correlation between ACE enzymatic activity in BAL supernatants and blood under normal situations suggested an independent regulation in both biologic compartments. This is further confirmed by high levels of APN and DPP IV activities measured under normal situations in the blood and almost undetectable activities in BAL fluid. In normal volunteers and in patients, the activity of ACE was detectable in all samples; however, the activities of APN and DPP IV were very low under normal situations but were dramatically increased in some pathologic samples. ACE (EC 3.4.15.1) is a ubiquitous membranebound ectopeptidase of wide specificity that is able to remove dipeptides and some tripeptides without processing from the carboxyl end of proteins. Its potential substrates include bradykinin, substance P, angiotensin I, and enkephalins. The use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension is sometimes linked to cough, possibly because of an increased bronchial reactivity and a decreased degradation by this enzyme of the proinflammatory peptides bradykinin or substance p.18 Interestingly, we found a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid from smokers than in that from other groups. Because ACE is involved in bradykinin degradation, this might have potentially important implications for the effect of smoking on peptide metabolism. Serum ACE activity is increased in active sarcoidosis, HIV, and hyperthyroidism, s'19-21 We did not find increased levels of this enzyme in the BAL fluid from patients with HIV, confirming the differential regulation of this enzyme in both compartments. The level of ACE activity was significantly increased in samples with high lymphocyte counts and in the BAL from patients with sarcoidosis, confirming previous results, 22 or lymphoid neoplasm, a new finding. In normal samples, ACE antigenicity was expressed only in macrophages. Several of the cell-surface antigens of the cluster differentiation system have emerged as cell-surface peptidases with a wide distribution. 1 DPP IV (EC 3.4.14.5), a peptidase specific for the release of xaa- pro and xaa-ala dipeptides from the N-terminal end of peptides, is analogous to CD26. DPP IV/CD26 is involved in T cell activation, mainly CD4+ cells, in vivo and in vitro, but is also expressed by epithelia, certain endothelia, and platelets. 1'23'24 The expression of DPP IV has been shown in bronchoalveolar macrophages 2s but not in BEAS-2B cells. 26 In the present study we found low levels of DPP IV activity in the same cell line and in A549 cells. This discrepancy may be explained by different methods of dos-age or by differences in the confluence of cultures, because we found that the expression of DPP IV activity was dependent on cell confluence in various epithelial cell lines (unpublished experiments). The number of CD26+,CD4 ÷ cells is decreased during HIV infection; however, the activity of DPP IV/CD26 is unchanged in the blood of patients with A I D S . 27 We observed the same lack of relationship in the BAL fluid. DPP IV activity was slightly increased, and independently of the presence of pely- Fig. 5 .

C, Negative control obtained without primary antibodies. morphonuclear cells, when the lymphocyte proportion was increased in BAL, but neither AIDS nor smoking by themselves importantly modified DPP IV activity in BAL fluid. Although no physiologic substrate for DPP IV has yet been formally identified, many important peptides including substance P and several cytokines or peptides derived fi'om collagen are all potential substrates. APN (EC 3.4.11.2) is analogous to CD13 and is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes; intestinal, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal epithelial tissue; some endothelia; and fibroblasts. This exopeptidase can release neutral amino acids from the N-terminal end of peptides, and a function has been postulated for APN in the modulation of activity of peptides and in tumor invasion and collagen degradation. 28 APN expression is regulated by biologically active peptides or by the state of cell differentiation. 29 T lymphocytes appear to be involved in the induction of APN in monocytes in a manner similar to that with ACE. 3° CD13-positive cells are permissive for cytomegalovirus infection. 31 Human APN has been shown to be a receptor for two human corona viruses from the gastrointestinal tract and human lung fibroblasts. 32 '33 In BAL fluid, we show that soluble APN activity was linked to an increased proportion of polymorphonuclear cells. However, actinonin, a relatively specific inhibitor of APN, could not completely inhibit the hydrolysis of leu-p-nitroanilide in BAL samples and in serum. Several explanations can be postulated. First, several enzymes act on the substrate, and each has a different sensitivity to actinonin inhibition. Second, the kinetic of inhibitor binding to enzyme(s) may be complex, which may explain an incomplete inhibition. Third, the hydrolysis of small substrates is still possible for some enzymes, even in the presence of bound inhibitors. The present approach did not allow us to differentiate these possibilities, and more detailed enzymatic analysis would be necessary to answer these questions. In the normal volunteer population, only very low levels of soluble APN and DPP IV activities could be detected, whereas bronchial BEAS-2B and alveolar A549 epithelial cells and bronchoalveolar macrophages expressed high levels of APN. However, in some pathologic states, such as infectious states, much higher amounts of active enzymes were present in soluble form in the epithelial lining fluid, indicating that shedding of these proteases from cell membrane occurs in disease. From the specific expression of these enzymes, APN and DPP IV activities may originate from both macrophages or epithelial cells, as well as endothelial cells, whereas Juillerat-Jeanneref, Aubert, and Leuenberger 613 ACE may originate only from macrophages or endothelial cells, where the expression of this enzyme is established. However, in some diseases, nonspecific diffusion from serum cannot be excluded. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that specific aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases were released as soluble enzymes in high amounts in some pulmonary pathologic states, either from bronchoalveolar structures or from immunocompetent cells of the bronchoalveolar layers, or from both. The observation that increased expression of these enzymes can be measured in some samples of any pathologic disorder limits their usefulness as diagnostic tools. Drugs able to modulate the APN/ CD13 and DPP IV/CD26 activities, in addition to inhibitors of ACE activity, may be potentially interesting in studying the metabolism of important peptide hormones.",

         "Methamphetamine use has emerged as a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of methamphetamine-associated ICH (Meth-ICH) versus Non-Meth-ICH. Patients with ICH between January 2011 and December 2017 were studied. Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH were defined by history of abuse and urine drug screen (UDS). The clinical features of the 2 groups were explored. Among the 677 consecutive patients, 61 (9.0%) were identified as Meth-ICH and 350 as Non-Meth ICH. Meth-ICH was more common in Hispanics (14.6%) and Whites (10.1%) as compared to Asians (1.2%). Patients with Meth-ICH were more often younger (51.2 vs. 62.2 years, p < 0.001), male (77.0% vs. 61.4.0%, p < 0.05), and smokers (44.3% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.001). Non-Meth-ICH was more likely to have history of hypertension (72.61% v. 59%, p < 0.05) or antithrombotic use (10.9% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in clinical severity, hospital length of stay (LOS), rate of functional independence (29.5% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.534), or mortality (18.0% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.267) between the 2 groups. Methamphetamine use was not an independent predictor of poor outcome. Despite difference in demographics, Meth-ICH is similar to Non-Meth ICH in hospital course and outcome.",

         "Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating type of strokes 1, 2 . The reported median 30-day mortality ranges from 17% to 40%, with rates of functional independency between 12% and 39% 1 . Recent randomized controlled studies have shown no significant benefit from intensive blood pressure control and early surgical intervention [3] [4] [5] . Since spontaneous ICH is potentially preventable, it is therefore a research priority to investigate any emerging risk of the disease. Methamphetamine use is a serious public health crisis, with estimated 37 million active users and 2.6 million disability-adjusted life years lost in 2010 6, 7 . Caplan at al. initially described incidence of intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage from methamphetamine abuse 8, 9 . Ischemic stroke was subsequently reported to be associated with methamphetamine use as well [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Both population-based study and forensic analysis of fatal strokes showed significant predominance of hemorrhagic strokes in young methamphetamine users 15, 16 . Methamphetamine use was associated with approximately fivefold increase in hemorrhagic stroke, twice higher than the risk from either cocaine or tobacco 15 . Lappin et al. performed a systemic review of methamphetamine-related stroke in 2017 and identified 81 hemorrhagic and 17 ischemic stroke cases from case reports and single center series 17 . Both types of stroke were approximately twice as common in males. There appears to be an alarming trend of increasing prevalence of methamphetamine-associated ICH (Meth-ICH) in the regions around the Pacific rim 17 Statistical analysis. Continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR) based on the results of normality testing. Categorical variables were expressed by counts with percentages. Baseline characteristics and outcomes at discharge were compared between Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH groups by Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables. Univariate analyses were performed initially to assess the possible factors associated with outcomes (functional independence and mortality at discharge). The cutoff value in univariate analysis for inclusion in the multivariate logistic regression was p < 0.1. Analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 23.0). A 2-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 677 consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017 were included. The flow chart for identification of Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH is shown in Fig. 1 . Thirty-two patients had recorded history of methamphetamine use. Among them, 30 had a UDS and 21 (70%) tested positive, indicative of methamphetamine use within the last 3 days 21 . Of the 645 patients who denied history of methamphetamine use, 379 (58.8%) had a UDS and 29 of them (7.7%) tested positive for amphetamine. Therefore, a total of 61 patients in the entire cohort (9%) were identified to have Meth-ICH (highlighted in pink color in Fig. 1 ). Given the fact that 7.7% of the patients who denied history of methamphetamine use had a positive UDS, the rate of Meth-ICH could be higher if all patients had a UDS. As highlighted in blue color in Fig. 1 , the 350 patients who denied a history of methamphetamine use and also had a negative UDS were classified as Non-Meth-ICH. The mean age of the cohort was 63.4 ± 15.9 (range 18-100). Three hundred ninety-eight patients (58.8%) were male. There were 286 White (42.2%), 192 Hispanic (28.4%), 166 Asian (24.5%), and 33 African-American (4.9%) patients (Fig. 2) . The rate of Meth-ICH was significantly higher in Hispanics (14.6% vs 1.2%; OR = 14.29, 95% CI 2.70-50.00; p < 0.001) and Whites (10.1% vs 1.2%; OR = 9.09, 95% CI 2.17-33.33; p < 0.001) than in Asians. The characteristics of the patients with Meth-ICH or Non-Meth-ICH are summarized in Table 1 . Compared with Non-Meth-ICH group, the patients with Meth-ICH were significantly younger (51.2 + 7.5 vs 62.2 + 15.9; p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (77% vs 61.4%; p = 0.019) and smokers (44.3% vs 13.4%, p < 0.001). Non-Meth-ICH was more likely to have history of hypertension (72.61% v. 59%, p < 0.05) or antithrombotic use (10.9% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in highest systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 24 hours of admission, NIHSS, GCS or ICH score between the 2 groups. There was significant difference in ICH location between the 2 groups (p = 0.001), with Meth-ICH group having less lobar hemorrhage (OR = 0.32, 95%CI 0.16-0.65, p = 0.001) and more primary IVH (OR = 6.16, 95%CI 1.73-21.97, p = 0.009). (2020) 10:6375 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63480-z www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Although Meth-ICH was more often treated with surgical interventions, likely due to younger ages, there was no significant difference in requirement for ventilator support and LOS in the ICU or hospital between the 2 groups. There was also no significant difference in either functional independence (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.66-2.20; p = 0.534) or mortality rate at hospital discharge (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.34-1.36; p = 0.267). Methamphetamine use per se was not a predictor of poor outcomes in patients with ICH. Factors associated with functional independency and mortality at hospital discharge were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. Overall, lower NIHSS and higher GCS score were associated with functional independence at hospital discharge per multivariate analysis ( Table 2 ). Higher NIHSS, ICH score, ventilator support, and absence of surgical interventions were independent predictors of mortality (Table 3 ). This study represents the largest single center cohort of Meth-ICH yet reported. It demonstrates that methamphetamine is an important risk factor for ICH in young males, smokers, Hispanic and White populations in Southern California. The rate of Meth-ICH was 9% in our large cohort, as compared to 13% and 16.4% reported previously 18, 19 . Of note, of the 645 patients who denied history of methamphetamine use, only 379 patients (58.8%) had a UDS and 29 (7.7%) were urine positive for amphetamine. The actual rate of Meth-ICH could be significantly higher if all ICH patients had a UDS. The observed age disparities in patients with Meth-ICH versus Non-Meth-ICH were consistent with previous reports 18, 19 . Although ordering UDS at admission was routine practice at our Stroke Center, the decision to obtain the test was at the discretion of the ED and on-call stroke team. Previous report showed ethnic disparities in ordering drug screens in patient with ICH, with young African Americans having more UDS 25 . We examined the ordering 26 . Of the 596 ICH patients, 357 (60%) had a UDS. A UDS was more likely to be obtained in patients who were younger (age < 45), male, smokers, self-reported methamphetamine users, with more severe deficit at presentation (NIHSS > 4), without diabetes, or not taking anticoagulant. There was no significant difference in UDS among different races (p = 0.319) 26 . Therefore, the higher rates of Meth-ICH in Hispanics and Whites were not due to bias in ordering UDS. In addition, hypertensive ICH is very prevalent in Asians 2 . However, only 1.2% (2/166) Asians in this cohort had Meth-ICH. These findings may have significant public health implication and may guide targeted community education for the prevention of Meth-ICH. The majority of Meth-ICH was located in the basal ganglia/thalamus, suggesting deep white matter small-vessel injuries from direct toxicity of methamphetamine or increased sympathetic system activation 15, 17, 27 . The proportion of lobar hemorrhage was significantly higher in Non-Meth-ICH (38.0% vs 16.4%), likely due to older age and history of hypertension, ischemic stroke, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy [28] [29] [30] . In our current study, there was no significant difference in ICH severity, ventilator support, LOS in the ICU or hospital, rate of functional independence or mortality at hospital discharge between Meth-ICH and www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Non-Meth-ICH. The severity of neurologic deficits at admission was the main predictor of functional independence and mortality. Methamphetamine use and demographic features including age were not independently associated with outcomes as they had been in previous studies 17, 29, 30 . Of note, our findings are significantly different from what was previously reported. Swor et al. showed that patients with Meth-ICH had significantly longer LOS in the ICU (10 ± 8 vs 5 ± 5 days) and hospital (18 ± 27 vs 8 ± 8 days) than Non-Meth-ICH 19 . They also showed higher mortality rates (29% vs 34%), as compared to our study (18% vs 25%). Several factors may account for lack of difference in LOS between the two groups and lower mortality rates in our study. First, although the Meth-ICH patients had higher NIHSS score, they were younger with less comorbidities as compared with Non-Meth-ICH patients. Second, there was no significant difference in highest blood pressures, GCS, ICH score and ventilator support between Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH groups. Third, all ICH patients were initially managed in the dedicated Neuroscience ICU with standard ICH order-set and clinical pathway by board-certified neurointensivits at our center. Management of ICH by neurocritical care specialists have been shown to be associated with shorter LOS and reduced mortality [31] [32] [33] . The mechanisms by which methamphetamine may cause ICH remains unclear. In 1970, Citron et al. studied 14 patients with polysubstance abuse, with almost all admitting methamphetamine use, and found necrotizing angiitis in medium-sized and small arteries of the brain and other organs 34 . Rumbaugh et al. analyzed the angiographic features of patients with methamphetamine abuse and described beaded arteries, segmental changes in vessel caliber, and regions of slow flow 35 . In monkeys receiving intravenous methamphetamine for two weeks, angiography showed similar beading and segmental changes, and necropsy revealed small cerebral hemorrhages, zones of infarction, and microaneurysms 36 . Davis et al. reported 4.9% incidence of methamphetamine intoxication in all autopsies in San Diego County from 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1993 and suggested possible propagation and rupture of berry aneurysms from methamphetamine use 37 . Of note, methamphetamine is a potent sympathomimetic. ICH may also occur secondary to methamphetamine-induced hypertensive surge in the absence of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease 38 . Chronic use of methamphetamine may cause long-term systemic hypertension and vessel damage 13, 17, 27, 39 . Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms of Meth-ICH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single-center cohort to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with Meth-ICH versus Non-Meth-ICH. Our study demonstrates that there is no significant difference in severity of ICH, LOS, favorable outcome and mortality between Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH. In addition, we found considerable proportion of patients who denied history of methamphetamine use turned out to have positive urine drug test, indicating possible higher prevalence of methamphetamine use in patients with ICH. The strengths of this study are the comprehensive comparison of the clinical features and outcomes of Meth-ICH verse non-Meth-ICH. Our findings provide better understanding of Meth-ICH vs Non-Meth-ICH and may help develop strategies for the effective treatment and prevention of Meth-ICH. Our study has a few limitations. First, this is a single-center study performed in Southern California. Our findings may not be generalizable to other regions or populations. Second, despite denying drug use history and negative urine drug test, it is still possible that there were undetected meth users in the Non-Meth-ICH group. Table 3 .

         "Clinical characteristics and outcomes of methamphetamine-associated versus non-methamphetamine intracerebral hemorrhage. Methamphetamine use has emerged as a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of methamphetamine-associated ICH (Meth-ICH) versus Non-Meth-ICH. Patients with ICH between January 2011 and December 2017 were studied. Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH were defined by history of abuse and urine drug screen (UDS). The clinical features of the 2 groups were explored. Among the 677 consecutive patients, 61 (9.0%) were identified as Meth-ICH and 350 as Non-Meth ICH. Meth-ICH was more common in Hispanics (14.6%) and Whites (10.1%) as compared to Asians (1.2%). Patients with Meth-ICH were more often younger (51.2 vs. 62.2 years, p < 0.001), male (77.0% vs. 61.4.0%, p < 0.05), and smokers (44.3% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.001). Non-Meth-ICH was more likely to have history of hypertension (72.61% v. 59%, p < 0.05) or antithrombotic use (10.9% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in clinical severity, hospital length of stay (LOS), rate of functional independence (29.5% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.534), or mortality (18.0% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.267) between the 2 groups. Methamphetamine use was not an independent predictor of poor outcome. Despite difference in demographics, Meth-ICH is similar to Non-Meth ICH in hospital course and outcome.. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating type of strokes 1, 2 . The reported median 30-day mortality ranges from 17% to 40%, with rates of functional independency between 12% and 39% 1 . Recent randomized controlled studies have shown no significant benefit from intensive blood pressure control and early surgical intervention [3] [4] [5] . Since spontaneous ICH is potentially preventable, it is therefore a research priority to investigate any emerging risk of the disease. Methamphetamine use is a serious public health crisis, with estimated 37 million active users and 2.6 million disability-adjusted life years lost in 2010 6, 7 . Caplan at al. initially described incidence of intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage from methamphetamine abuse 8, 9 . Ischemic stroke was subsequently reported to be associated with methamphetamine use as well [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Both population-based study and forensic analysis of fatal strokes showed significant predominance of hemorrhagic strokes in young methamphetamine users 15, 16 . Methamphetamine use was associated with approximately fivefold increase in hemorrhagic stroke, twice higher than the risk from either cocaine or tobacco 15 . Lappin et al. performed a systemic review of methamphetamine-related stroke in 2017 and identified 81 hemorrhagic and 17 ischemic stroke cases from case reports and single center series 17 . Both types of stroke were approximately twice as common in males. There appears to be an alarming trend of increasing prevalence of methamphetamine-associated ICH (Meth-ICH) in the regions around the Pacific rim 17 Statistical analysis. Continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR) based on the results of normality testing. Categorical variables were expressed by counts with percentages. Baseline characteristics and outcomes at discharge were compared between Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH groups by Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables. Univariate analyses were performed initially to assess the possible factors associated with outcomes (functional independence and mortality at discharge). The cutoff value in univariate analysis for inclusion in the multivariate logistic regression was p < 0.1. Analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 23.0). A 2-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 677 consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017 were included. The flow chart for identification of Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH is shown in Fig. 1 . Thirty-two patients had recorded history of methamphetamine use. Among them, 30 had a UDS and 21 (70%) tested positive, indicative of methamphetamine use within the last 3 days 21 . Of the 645 patients who denied history of methamphetamine use, 379 (58.8%) had a UDS and 29 of them (7.7%) tested positive for amphetamine. Therefore, a total of 61 patients in the entire cohort (9%) were identified to have Meth-ICH (highlighted in pink color in Fig. 1 ). Given the fact that 7.7% of the patients who denied history of methamphetamine use had a positive UDS, the rate of Meth-ICH could be higher if all patients had a UDS. As highlighted in blue color in Fig. 1 , the 350 patients who denied a history of methamphetamine use and also had a negative UDS were classified as Non-Meth-ICH. The mean age of the cohort was 63.4 ± 15.9 (range 18-100). Three hundred ninety-eight patients (58.8%) were male. There were 286 White (42.2%), 192 Hispanic (28.4%), 166 Asian (24.5%), and 33 African-American (4.9%) patients (Fig. 2) . The rate of Meth-ICH was significantly higher in Hispanics (14.6% vs 1.2%; OR = 14.29, 95% CI 2.70-50.00; p < 0.001) and Whites (10.1% vs 1.2%; OR = 9.09, 95% CI 2.17-33.33; p < 0.001) than in Asians. The characteristics of the patients with Meth-ICH or Non-Meth-ICH are summarized in Table 1 . Compared with Non-Meth-ICH group, the patients with Meth-ICH were significantly younger (51.2 + 7.5 vs 62.2 + 15.9; p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (77% vs 61.4%; p = 0.019) and smokers (44.3% vs 13.4%, p < 0.001). Non-Meth-ICH was more likely to have history of hypertension (72.61% v. 59%, p < 0.05) or antithrombotic use (10.9% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in highest systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 24 hours of admission, NIHSS, GCS or ICH score between the 2 groups. There was significant difference in ICH location between the 2 groups (p = 0.001), with Meth-ICH group having less lobar hemorrhage (OR = 0.32, 95%CI 0.16-0.65, p = 0.001) and more primary IVH (OR = 6.16, 95%CI 1.73-21.97, p = 0.009). (2020) 10:6375 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63480-z www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Although Meth-ICH was more often treated with surgical interventions, likely due to younger ages, there was no significant difference in requirement for ventilator support and LOS in the ICU or hospital between the 2 groups. There was also no significant difference in either functional independence (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.66-2.20; p = 0.534) or mortality rate at hospital discharge (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.34-1.36; p = 0.267). Methamphetamine use per se was not a predictor of poor outcomes in patients with ICH. Factors associated with functional independency and mortality at hospital discharge were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. Overall, lower NIHSS and higher GCS score were associated with functional independence at hospital discharge per multivariate analysis ( Table 2 ). Higher NIHSS, ICH score, ventilator support, and absence of surgical interventions were independent predictors of mortality (Table 3 ). This study represents the largest single center cohort of Meth-ICH yet reported. It demonstrates that methamphetamine is an important risk factor for ICH in young males, smokers, Hispanic and White populations in Southern California. The rate of Meth-ICH was 9% in our large cohort, as compared to 13% and 16.4% reported previously 18, 19 . Of note, of the 645 patients who denied history of methamphetamine use, only 379 patients (58.8%) had a UDS and 29 (7.7%) were urine positive for amphetamine. The actual rate of Meth-ICH could be significantly higher if all ICH patients had a UDS. The observed age disparities in patients with Meth-ICH versus Non-Meth-ICH were consistent with previous reports 18, 19 . Although ordering UDS at admission was routine practice at our Stroke Center, the decision to obtain the test was at the discretion of the ED and on-call stroke team. Previous report showed ethnic disparities in ordering drug screens in patient with ICH, with young African Americans having more UDS 25 . We examined the ordering 26 . Of the 596 ICH patients, 357 (60%) had a UDS. A UDS was more likely to be obtained in patients who were younger (age < 45), male, smokers, self-reported methamphetamine users, with more severe deficit at presentation (NIHSS > 4), without diabetes, or not taking anticoagulant. There was no significant difference in UDS among different races (p = 0.319) 26 . Therefore, the higher rates of Meth-ICH in Hispanics and Whites were not due to bias in ordering UDS. In addition, hypertensive ICH is very prevalent in Asians 2 . However, only 1.2% (2/166) Asians in this cohort had Meth-ICH. These findings may have significant public health implication and may guide targeted community education for the prevention of Meth-ICH. The majority of Meth-ICH was located in the basal ganglia/thalamus, suggesting deep white matter small-vessel injuries from direct toxicity of methamphetamine or increased sympathetic system activation 15, 17, 27 . The proportion of lobar hemorrhage was significantly higher in Non-Meth-ICH (38.0% vs 16.4%), likely due to older age and history of hypertension, ischemic stroke, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy [28] [29] [30] . In our current study, there was no significant difference in ICH severity, ventilator support, LOS in the ICU or hospital, rate of functional independence or mortality at hospital discharge between Meth-ICH and www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Non-Meth-ICH. The severity of neurologic deficits at admission was the main predictor of functional independence and mortality. Methamphetamine use and demographic features including age were not independently associated with outcomes as they had been in previous studies 17, 29, 30 . Of note, our findings are significantly different from what was previously reported. Swor et al. showed that patients with Meth-ICH had significantly longer LOS in the ICU (10 ± 8 vs 5 ± 5 days) and hospital (18 ± 27 vs 8 ± 8 days) than Non-Meth-ICH 19 . They also showed higher mortality rates (29% vs 34%), as compared to our study (18% vs 25%). Several factors may account for lack of difference in LOS between the two groups and lower mortality rates in our study. First, although the Meth-ICH patients had higher NIHSS score, they were younger with less comorbidities as compared with Non-Meth-ICH patients. Second, there was no significant difference in highest blood pressures, GCS, ICH score and ventilator support between Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH groups. Third, all ICH patients were initially managed in the dedicated Neuroscience ICU with standard ICH order-set and clinical pathway by board-certified neurointensivits at our center. Management of ICH by neurocritical care specialists have been shown to be associated with shorter LOS and reduced mortality [31] [32] [33] .

         "Decreased FEV (1)% in asthmatic adults in Scottish homes with high Environmental Relative Moldiness Index values",
         "BACKGROUND: Exposures to indoor biological contaminants have been implicated in asthma's aetiology but their effect on lung function is not well quantified. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross‐sectional study of non‐smoking, asthmatic adults in Scotland was to determine the correlation between the results from a standard spirometry test, forced expiratory volume in one‐second percent (FEV (1)%), and quantitative estimates of some biological exposures. METHODS: A population (n = 55) of non‐smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland was included in this study and each completed a questionnaire that allowed the determination of the Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (ACQ) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ), as well as corticosteroid use. Spirometry testing was completed and the pre‐bronchodilator FEV (1)% value calculated. At about the same time, floor dust samples were collected in the living room and in the bedroom. These dust samples were analysed for mould contamination, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values and by (1, 3)‐β‐D‐glucan concentrations, for endotoxin, and for dust mite, cat, and dog allergen concentrations. The asthmatics' FEV (1)% values were tested for correlation (Pearson) to questionnaire‐based estimates of health. Also, each biological exposure was tested for correlation (Pearson) to the FEV (1)% values. RESULTS: FEV (1)% results were correlated with ACQ scores (ρ −0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (ρ −0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (ρ −0.221, P = 0.105). The ERMI values in the homes (average 5.3) were significantly correlated with FEV (1)% values (ρ −0.378, P = 0.004). There was no correlation between FEV (1)% and concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)‐β‐D‐glucan, or any of the allergens. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although these results do not prove that mould exposures caused the deficit in lung function observed in this study, it might be advisable for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.",

         "World-wide, 300 million people have asthma [1] , including approximately 1.1 million children and 4.3 million adults in the UK [2] . In Scotland, 1 in 14 people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. Surveys indicate that many patients with severe asthma have poor symptom control and reduced lung function [3] [4] [5] . Asthma has been associate with various biological exposures, including mould, endotoxin, and allergens (dust mite, insect, and animal). Depending on the study, each of the agents has been reported to cause, have no effect on, or be protective of the asthma. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review all of this literature. However, only a few studies have examined these biological exposures and their association with lung function as quantified by spirometry testing and the resulting FEV 1 % values. Mould exposures have often been estimated using the cell product (1, 3)-b-D-glucan. The studies of (1, 3)-b-D-glucan's link to lung function generally report a lack of a relationship to FEV 1 % measurements. For example, Thorn and Rylander [6] found no effect of different exposures of 0-19 ng (1, 3)-b-D-glucan per m 3 of air on FEV 1 %. Similarly, Blanc et al. [7] found no correlation between (1, 3)-b-D-glucan concentration in the dust and FEV 1 % values. However, the high ERMI values in homes of asthmatic children in New Orleans were linked to reduced FEV 1 % values [8] . Gram-negative bacterial exposures, estimated by measurement of endotoxin concentrations, were inversely associated with FEV 1 % values [7] . But in other studies, endotoxin exposures were found to be protective in a manner consistent with the hygiene hypothesis [9] . But high occupational levels of endotoxin caused FEV 1 % values to be reduced [10] . However, inhalation of 2 lg of endotoxin did not induce any changes in FEV 1 % values [11] . Dust mite allergen concentrations were not correlated with FEV 1 % values in a study of adult asthmatics in the U.S. [7] . Chiang et al. [12] also found no correlation between the concentration of dust mite allergen antibodies and lung function. However, Omenaas et al. [13] found that exposure of dust mite allergen correlated with reduced FEV 1 % values in Norwegian adults. These diverse findings might be explained by host genetics. Abdelmotelb et al. [14] showed that the number of copies of the a-tryptase gene might be critical to the effect of dust mite exposures on lung function. The effect of exposures to insect and animal allergens on FEV 1 % values has been examined in some studies. Weiss et al. [15] found that exposures to cockroach, but not dust mite or cat allergens, were correlated with a decline in FEV 1 % test results. Ja en et al. [16] showed that exposure to cat allergen was associated with lower FEV 1 values, but only for women. The aims of this cross-sectional study of non-smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland were to determine the correlation between FEV 1 % values and questionnairebased measures of respiratory health and to determine the correlation between FEV 1 % values and some biological exposures in the home. The dust samples and environmental and anonymous clinical data that were obtained in an earlier study [17] were utilized in this analysis. The original study was approved by the Lanarkshire Research Ethics Committee and all participants gave written informed consent. This study was conducted from 2006 to 2008 and the details have been published [17] . The original study design was to test whether an added home ventilation system might improve the respiratory health of asthmatic adults who were all allergic to house dust mites. However, because dust samples were collected from each home and because spirometry testing was performed on each adult at baseline (before the intervention), there was an opportunity to use the baseline data and samples in a cross-sectional study of the effect of some biological exposures on the respiratory health of the asthmatic adults. A volunteered smoking history was taken and serum samples obtained to determine the cotinine concentration (Cozart Bioscience Ltd, Abingdon, UK) in order to confirm smoking status [17] . As smoking is the major exposure affecting pulmonary function [18] , smokers were excluded from this evaluation of the relationship between biological exposures and respiratory health. Persons 16-60 years of age with asthma were recruited for the original study [17] . At the time of the initial baseline clinical visit, a health questionnaire was completed and spirometry testing performed (before the use of a bronchodilator) by each person using a Vitalograph Spirometer (Buckingham, UK). The FEV 1 % of predicted normal was calculated using the European Community for Coal and Steel, 1993 updated reference formula [19] which also adjusts for age, gender, and height and is incorporated into the output from the spirometer. At about the time of the clinical visit, dust samples were collected from the living room floor and separately from the bedroom floor of each home. The open areas (not covered by lamps, furniture etc.) in each room were vacuumed at a rate of 1 m 2 per min using a Dyson, 1500 watt, model-DC14 (Dyson, London, UK) vacuum cleaner [17] . For example, if there was 2 m 2 of open floor space in a room, it was vacuumed for 2 min to collect that sample. The Dyson DC14 is a bagless vacuum cleaner that uses an extremely effective HEPA filter and captures all particles above 0.3 microns in size, as measured by a laser particle scanner. The dust was collected in the vacuum's reservoir which was meticulously cleaned between each sampling event. The dust in the reservoir was emptied into a sealable bag, placed in a refrigerated cooler, and returned to the laboratory. At the laboratory, the dust samples were screened through a 2-mm-pore sieve to remove large particles and then stored at À20°C before further processing and analysis. The concentration of dust mite allergens, cat allergen, dog allergen, (1-3)-b-glucan, and endotoxin was quantified in each living room and bedroom sample, as previously described [17] . For the ERMI analysis, 5.0 AE 0.1 mg of the total, combined living room and bedroom dust samples were extracted using a bead beater (after the internal reference organism was added), as previously described [20] . The 36 ERMI moulds were quantified in each dust extract by QPCR analysis [20] . Briefly, the standard reaction assays contained 12.5 lL of Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), 1 lL of a mixture of forward and reverse primers at 25 lM each, 2.5 lL of a 400 nM TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 2.5 lL of 2 mg/mL fraction V bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 2.5 lL of DNA-free water (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). To this mix was added 5 lL of the DNA extract from the sample. All primer and probe sequences used in the assays have been published [21] . Primers and probes were synthesized commercially (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The ERMI value for each home was calculated, as shown in Eqn. (The 26 'Group 1' species are found in water-damaged homes and the 10 'Group 2' species are found in homes independent of water damage and that generally, but not exclusively, come from outdoors.) Associations between FEV 1 % and other measures of respiratory health, that is ACQ, SGRQ scores, and corticosteroid use, were determined via their respective Pearson correlation coefficients. Likewise, relationship between FEV 1 % results and the biological exposures, that is ERMI values, allergens from dust mite, cat, and dog, (1, 3)-b-D-glucan, and endotoxin, were determined via their respective Pearson correlation coefficients. In addition, multiple linear-regression analysis was used to further investigate the relationship between FEV 1 % and the combination ERMI score and living room endotoxin levels, given the latter's marginally significant relationship with FEV 1 %. Regression analysis of FEV 1 % on ERMI was performed and graphed along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Analyses were performed in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 2.14 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The demographic, clinical or home characteristics of the non-smoking, adult asthmatics and their homes are shown in Table 1 . The FEV 1 % test results were correlated with ACQ scores (q À0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (q À0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (q À0.221, P = 0.105) ( Table 2 ). The ERMI values in the homes were significantly correlated with FEV 1 % test results (q À0.378, P = 0.004) ( Table 3) . There was no correlation between FEV 1 % and the concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)-b-D-glucan, or any of the allergens ( Table 3) . The average ERMI value in these homes in Scotland was 5.3 (standard deviation 4.5), and the average FEV 1 % test result was 85.4% (standard deviation 18.6%). The regression analysis scatter plot of FEV 1 % test results on ERMI values showed their inverse relationship (Fig. 1) . Living room endotoxin levels alone were marginally related to FEV 1 % values (P = 0.063) and their inclusion in the multiple linear-regression analysis, along with ERMI values, only increased the R 2 of the regression from 14% to 17%. The demographic, clinical or home characteristics of the non-smoker, adult asthmatics and their homes are shown in Table 1 . Except for cotinine concentrations, these values were comparable to the entire cohort (smokers and non-smokers) in the original study (data not given) [17] . We found that FEV 1 %, as an objective measure of respiratory health, was correlated with other measures of respiratory health which are based on recall in answering a questionnaire, that is corticosteroid use, ACQ and SGRQ scores. The ACQ score does include the FEV 1 % value, so it is not surprising that the FEV 1 % values are the most highly correlated with ACQ scores. The mould exposure, as described by the ERMI values in each home, was the only biological assessment that was correlated with FEV 1 % results. The average ERMI value in these Scottish homes of asthmatic adults was 5.3. In a study of asthmatic adults in the U.S., specifically California, the average ERMI value was 6.0 [23] . No other study of adult asthmatics has utilized the ERMI metric. However, the homes of asthmatic children in three cities (Boston, Kansas City and San Diego) in the U.S., had an average ERMI value of 8.7 [24] . Also, infants exposed to homes with ERMI values above 5 were found to be twice as likely to develop asthma by age seven [25] . So the average ERMI value measured in the homes of asthmatic adults in Scotland was consistent with results from the homes of asthmatic adults and children in the US. We recognize that asthma has a complex aetiology and there are likely many causes. However, if mould is causing some cases of asthma, then elucidating the agent's causal mechanism would help clarify the relationship. Recently, Millien et al. [26] demonstrated that some moulds can cause chronic airway surface mycotic infections (ASMI) in a mouse model of asthma. These ASMI result in lung damage, which includes enhanced airway epithelial and vascular endothelial cell permeability. ASMI set into motion a cascade of events that led to asthma-like symptoms in these mice. If this model is confirmed in humans, then it would help to explain why high mould exposures are linked to some cases of asthma. Many of the previous studies of the relationship between mould exposures and asthma have utilized methods that are not reliably quantified, for example visual inspection or mouldy odour. The ERMI is a standardized metric developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, to describe mould contamination in U.S. homes [22] . Its wider geographic applicability remains to be seen. Although mould exposures have been linked to asthma in many studies [27] [28] [29] , the linkage to lung function, as quantified by spirometry testing, has not often been included in such studies. Norb€ ack et al. [30] did show that the presence of dampness in homes was a risk factor for lung function decline, especially in women. Although our results in Scotland suggest that there is a quantitative link between mould exposures and reduced lung function, this study cannot be considered as causal proof because of the study's many limitations. The limitations of this study included the relatively small sample size, the fact that the sampled population was not randomly obtained (but part of earlier study), and many chemicals associated with decreased lung function [31] were not measured. Also, we did not quantify every possible biological exposure, including specific bacteria [32] , viruses [33] , or horse allergens [34] that might affect FEV 1 % values. In addition, dust samples were used in this study, as opposed to air samples, which might have provided different results [35] . Also, we recognize that the ERMI scale was created for US housing and improvements to the scale might be made for Europe by a random European sampling of homes, as was carried out in the US to create the ERMI [36] . In spite of these many limitations, this study in Scotland adds to the growing scientific literature linking mould exposure to poor respiratory health and asthma. Therefore, it might be prudent for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.",
         "Decreased FEV (1)% in asthmatic adults in Scottish homes with high Environmental Relative Moldiness Index values. BACKGROUND: Exposures to indoor biological contaminants have been implicated in asthma's aetiology but their effect on lung function is not well quantified. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross‐sectional study of non‐smoking, asthmatic adults in Scotland was to determine the correlation between the results from a standard spirometry test, forced expiratory volume in one‐second percent (FEV (1)%), and quantitative estimates of some biological exposures. METHODS: A population (n = 55) of non‐smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland was included in this study and each completed a questionnaire that allowed the determination of the Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (ACQ) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ), as well as corticosteroid use. Spirometry testing was completed and the pre‐bronchodilator FEV (1)% value calculated. At about the same time, floor dust samples were collected in the living room and in the bedroom. These dust samples were analysed for mould contamination, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values and by (1, 3)‐β‐D‐glucan concentrations, for endotoxin, and for dust mite, cat, and dog allergen concentrations. The asthmatics' FEV (1)% values were tested for correlation (Pearson) to questionnaire‐based estimates of health. Also, each biological exposure was tested for correlation (Pearson) to the FEV (1)% values. RESULTS: FEV (1)% results were correlated with ACQ scores (ρ −0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (ρ −0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (ρ −0.221, P = 0.105). The ERMI values in the homes (average 5.3) were significantly correlated with FEV (1)% values (ρ −0.378, P = 0.004). There was no correlation between FEV (1)% and concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)‐β‐D‐glucan, or any of the allergens. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although these results do not prove that mould exposures caused the deficit in lung function observed in this study, it might be advisable for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.. World-wide, 300 million people have asthma [1] , including approximately 1.1 million children and 4.3 million adults in the UK [2] . In Scotland, 1 in 14 people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. Surveys indicate that many patients with severe asthma have poor symptom control and reduced lung function [3] [4] [5] . Asthma has been associate with various biological exposures, including mould, endotoxin, and allergens (dust mite, insect, and animal). Depending on the study, each of the agents has been reported to cause, have no effect on, or be protective of the asthma. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review all of this literature. However, only a few studies have examined these biological exposures and their association with lung function as quantified by spirometry testing and the resulting FEV 1 % values. Mould exposures have often been estimated using the cell product (1, 3)-b-D-glucan. The studies of (1, 3)-b-D-glucan's link to lung function generally report a lack of a relationship to FEV 1 % measurements. For example, Thorn and Rylander [6] found no effect of different exposures of 0-19 ng (1, 3)-b-D-glucan per m 3 of air on FEV 1 %. Similarly, Blanc et al. [7] found no correlation between (1, 3)-b-D-glucan concentration in the dust and FEV 1 % values. However, the high ERMI values in homes of asthmatic children in New Orleans were linked to reduced FEV 1 % values [8] . Gram-negative bacterial exposures, estimated by measurement of endotoxin concentrations, were inversely associated with FEV 1 % values [7] . But in other studies, endotoxin exposures were found to be protective in a manner consistent with the hygiene hypothesis [9] . But high occupational levels of endotoxin caused FEV 1 % values to be reduced [10] . However, inhalation of 2 lg of endotoxin did not induce any changes in FEV 1 % values [11] . Dust mite allergen concentrations were not correlated with FEV 1 % values in a study of adult asthmatics in the U.S. [7] . Chiang et al. [12] also found no correlation between the concentration of dust mite allergen antibodies and lung function. However, Omenaas et al. [13] found that exposure of dust mite allergen correlated with reduced FEV 1 % values in Norwegian adults. These diverse findings might be explained by host genetics. Abdelmotelb et al. [14] showed that the number of copies of the a-tryptase gene might be critical to the effect of dust mite exposures on lung function. The effect of exposures to insect and animal allergens on FEV 1 % values has been examined in some studies. Weiss et al. [15] found that exposures to cockroach, but not dust mite or cat allergens, were correlated with a decline in FEV 1 % test results. Ja en et al. [16] showed that exposure to cat allergen was associated with lower FEV 1 values, but only for women. The aims of this cross-sectional study of non-smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland were to determine the correlation between FEV 1 % values and questionnairebased measures of respiratory health and to determine the correlation between FEV 1 % values and some biological exposures in the home. The dust samples and environmental and anonymous clinical data that were obtained in an earlier study [17] were utilized in this analysis. The original study was approved by the Lanarkshire Research Ethics Committee and all participants gave written informed consent. This study was conducted from 2006 to 2008 and the details have been published [17] . The original study design was to test whether an added home ventilation system might improve the respiratory health of asthmatic adults who were all allergic to house dust mites. However, because dust samples were collected from each home and because spirometry testing was performed on each adult at baseline (before the intervention), there was an opportunity to use the baseline data and samples in a cross-sectional study of the effect of some biological exposures on the respiratory health of the asthmatic adults. A volunteered smoking history was taken and serum samples obtained to determine the cotinine concentration (Cozart Bioscience Ltd, Abingdon, UK) in order to confirm smoking status [17] . As smoking is the major exposure affecting pulmonary function [18] , smokers were excluded from this evaluation of the relationship between biological exposures and respiratory health. Persons 16-60 years of age with asthma were recruited for the original study [17] . At the time of the initial baseline clinical visit, a health questionnaire was completed and spirometry testing performed (before the use of a bronchodilator) by each person using a Vitalograph Spirometer (Buckingham, UK). The FEV 1 % of predicted normal was calculated using the European Community for Coal and Steel, 1993 updated reference formula [19] which also adjusts for age, gender, and height and is incorporated into the output from the spirometer. At about the time of the clinical visit, dust samples were collected from the living room floor and separately from the bedroom floor of each home. The open areas (not covered by lamps, furniture etc.) in each room were vacuumed at a rate of 1 m 2 per min using a Dyson, 1500 watt, model-DC14 (Dyson, London, UK) vacuum cleaner [17] . For example, if there was 2 m 2 of open floor space in a room, it was vacuumed for 2 min to collect that sample. The Dyson DC14 is a bagless vacuum cleaner that uses an extremely effective HEPA filter and captures all particles above 0.3 microns in size, as measured by a laser particle scanner. The dust was collected in the vacuum's reservoir which was meticulously cleaned between each sampling event. The dust in the reservoir was emptied into a sealable bag, placed in a refrigerated cooler, and returned to the laboratory. At the laboratory, the dust samples were screened through a 2-mm-pore sieve to remove large particles and then stored at À20°C before further processing and analysis. The concentration of dust mite allergens, cat allergen, dog allergen, (1-3)-b-glucan, and endotoxin was quantified in each living room and bedroom sample, as previously described [17] . For the ERMI analysis, 5.0 AE 0.1 mg of the total, combined living room and bedroom dust samples were extracted using a bead beater (after the internal reference organism was added), as previously described [20] . The 36 ERMI moulds were quantified in each dust extract by QPCR analysis [20] . Briefly, the standard reaction assays contained 12.5 lL of Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), 1 lL of a mixture of forward and reverse primers at 25 lM each, 2.5 lL of a 400 nM TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 2.5 lL of 2 mg/mL fraction V bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 2.5 lL of DNA-free water (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). To this mix was added 5 lL of the DNA extract from the sample. All primer and probe sequences used in the assays have been published [21] . Primers and probes were synthesized commercially (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The ERMI value for each home was calculated, as shown in Eqn. (The 26 'Group 1' species are found in water-damaged homes and the 10 'Group 2' species are found in homes independent of water damage and that generally, but not exclusively, come from outdoors.) Associations between FEV 1 % and other measures of respiratory health, that is ACQ, SGRQ scores, and corticosteroid use, were determined via their respective Pearson correlation coefficients. Likewise, relationship between FEV 1 % results and the biological exposures, that is ERMI values, allergens from dust mite, cat, and dog, (1, 3)-b-D-glucan, and endotoxin, were determined via their respective Pearson correlation coefficients. In addition, multiple linear-regression analysis was used to further investigate the relationship between FEV 1 % and the combination ERMI score and living room endotoxin levels, given the latter's marginally significant relationship with FEV 1 %. Regression analysis of FEV 1 % on ERMI was performed and graphed along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Analyses were performed in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 2.14 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The demographic, clinical or home characteristics of the non-smoking, adult asthmatics and their homes are shown in Table 1 . The FEV 1 % test results were correlated with ACQ scores (q À0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (q À0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (q À0.221, P = 0.105) ( Table 2 ). The ERMI values in the homes were significantly correlated with FEV 1 % test results (q À0.378, P = 0.004) ( Table 3) . There was no correlation between FEV 1 % and the concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)-b-D-glucan, or any of the allergens ( Table 3) . The average ERMI value in these homes in Scotland was 5.3 (standard deviation 4.5), and the average FEV 1 % test result was 85.4% (standard deviation 18.6%). The regression analysis scatter plot of FEV 1 % test results on ERMI values showed their inverse relationship (Fig. 1) . Living room endotoxin levels alone were marginally related to FEV 1 % values (P = 0.063) and their inclusion in the multiple linear-regression analysis, along with ERMI values, only increased the R 2 of the regression from 14% to 17%. The demographic, clinical or home characteristics of the non-smoker, adult asthmatics and their homes are shown in Table 1 . Except for cotinine concentrations, these values were comparable to the entire cohort (smokers and non-smokers) in the original study (data not given) [17] . We found that FEV 1 %, as an objective measure of respiratory health, was correlated with other measures of respiratory health which are based on recall in answering a questionnaire, that is corticosteroid use, ACQ and SGRQ scores. The ACQ score does include the FEV 1 % value, so it is not surprising that the FEV 1 % values are the most highly correlated with ACQ scores. The mould exposure, as described by the ERMI values in each home, was the only biological assessment that was correlated with FEV 1 % results. The average ERMI value in these Scottish homes of asthmatic adults was 5.3. In a study of asthmatic adults in the U.S., specifically California, the average ERMI value was 6.0 [23] . No other study of adult asthmatics has utilized the ERMI metric. However, the homes of asthmatic children in three cities (Boston, Kansas City and San Diego) in the U.S., had an average ERMI value of 8.7 [24] . Also, infants exposed to homes with ERMI values above 5 were found to be twice as likely to develop asthma by age seven [25] . So the average ERMI value measured in the homes of asthmatic adults in Scotland was consistent with results from the homes of asthmatic adults and children in the US. We recognize that asthma has a complex aetiology and there are likely many causes. However, if mould is causing some cases of asthma, then elucidating the agent's causal mechanism would help clarify the relationship. Recently, Millien et al. [26] demonstrated that some moulds can cause chronic airway surface mycotic infections (ASMI) in a mouse model of asthma.

         "Effect of experimental rhinovirus 16 colds on airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine and interleukin‐8 in nasal lavage in asthmatic subjects in vivo",
         "Background Asthma exacerbations are closely associated with respiratory virus infections. However, the pathophysiological consequences of such infections in asthma are largely unclear. Objective To examine the effect of rhinovirus 16 (RV16) infection on airway hypersensitivity to histamine. and on interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) in nasal lavage. Objective Twenty‐seven non‐smoking atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects participated in a placebo‐controlled, parallel study. A dose of 0.5–2.9 ± 10(4) TCID50 RV16 or placebo was nasally administered. Cold symptoms were recorded by questionnaire throughout the study. Histamine challenges were performed at entry, and on days 4 and 11 after inoculation. Nasal lavages were obtained at entry, and on days 2 and 9. The response to histamine was measured by PC(20) (changes expressed as doubling doses: DD). IL‐8 levels were obtained by ELISA, and were expressed in ng/ml. Results RV infection was confirmed by culture of nasal lavage and/or by antibody titre rise in each of the RV16‐treated subjects. Among the 19 RV16‐treated subjects, eight developed severe cold symptoms. Baseline FEV(1) did not change significantly during the study in either treatment group (P= 0.99). However, in the RV16‐treated subjects there was a decrease in PC(20) at day 4, which was most pronounced in those with a severe cold (mean change ± SEM: –1.14 ± 0.28 DD, P= 0.01). In addition. IL‐8 levels increased in tbe RV16 group at days 2 and 9 (P < 0.001). The increase in nasal IL‐8 at day 2 correlated significantly with the change in PC(20) at day 4 (r=–0.48, P= 0.04). Conclusion We conclude that the severity of cold, as induced by experimental RV16 infection, is a determinant of the increase in airway hypersensitivity to histamine in patients with asthma. Our results suggest that this may be mediated by an infiammatory mechanism, involving the release of chemokines such as IL‐8.",

         "virus infections and/or to airborne allergens, potentially leading lo a flare-up of airway inliammation II.2|. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have described a close lemporal as.^ociation of respiratory virus infections with asthma exacerbations [3|. Respiratory viruses can be identified in 10 to 44% of the asthma exacerbations in adults |4.5|. whilst in children identification rates vary from 26 to 83'/f [6] [7] [8] [9] . The use of sen.sitive techniques to detect rhinovirus and coronavirus in the two most recent studies have resulted in the highest identification rates so far [5. 9|. Among the various respiratory viruses identilied, rhinovirus predominates in most of these studies 15.7-91. Interestingly, rbinovirus shedding in the absence of cold symptoms does not seem to be associated with clinical worsening of asthma [7] . The effects of experimental rhinovirus infection on airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine are somewhat controversial. Lemanske et al. demonstrated an induction of hypersensitivity to histamine after experimental rbinovirus 16 (RVI6) infection in non-asthmatic patients with atopic rhinitis [lO] . whereas others have not observed such an effect when using other rhinovirus scrotypes [11.12] . In asthmatic subjects. Halperin et al. found increased hypersensitivity to histamine in only four out of 22 subjects after experimental rhinovirus (serotype 39 and HH strain) infection 113|. whilst in the most recent study by Fraenke! et al. a rather small, but significant increase in sensitivity to histamine could be detected in six asthmatic subjects after infection with RVI6 [ 14|. Since none of these studies was placebo-controlled, it seems mandatory to examine the effect of experimental rhinovirus infection on airway sensitivity to histamine in asthmatic subjects by using such a design. This has successfully been employed in our previous study, showing excessive airway narrowing to methacholine after RVl6 infection in atopic asthmatic subjects | LS]. Rhinovirus infection has been shown to lead to infiltration of inflammator>' cells into nasal secretions and mucosa fl6-18| as well us into the bronchia! mucusa |I4] in normal and/or atopic subjects. In vitro, there is evidence that bronchial epithelial cell lines, fibroblasts and mononuclear cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection with rhinovirus 119-211. In vivo, the levels of chemokines such as interleukin-8. RANTES and MIP-lo; were found to be elevated in nasal secretions of asthmatic children during naturally acquired colds [22.23] . Consequently, one can postulate that chemokines such as IL-8 drive recruitment of inflammatory cells |24!. thus promoting airway inflammation, and thereby airway sensitivity to histamine. In the present study, we hypothesized that experimental RVI6 colds in atopic asthmatic patients increase airway sensitivity to histamine. particularly in those with severe cold symptoms. In addition, we postulated that this effect is associated with a rise of IL-8 in nasal secretion. To tbat end. we measured dose-response curves to inhaled histamine and levels of IL-8 in nusul washings before and after placebocontrolled nasal inhalation of wild type RV16 in atopic. mildly asthmatic patients. Twenty-seven non-smoking, atopic asthmatic subjects participated in this study. The subjects had not used inhaled or oral corticosteroids for at least 3 months, nor had they used theophyllines. antihistamines. sodium cromoglycate, or nedocromyl sodium for at least 6 weeks preceding the study. Symptoms of asthma were stable and controlled by on demand usage of inhaled salbutamol alone, that was withheld for at least 8 h before the measurements. There was no history of relevant exposure to allergens from 2 weeks before until the end of the study. The patients were not selected on basis of a history of virus-induced exacerbations. Among the eight subjects who received placebo-inocuiatit^n. four did not have neutralizing antibodies in their undiluted sent against 20-25 tissue culture infective dose (< 1:1). and four had titres between 1:2 and 1:128 serum dilution. Fourteen out of the 19 .subjects who received virus did not have neutralizing antibodies, and live had titres in the range of 1:2 to 1:16 serum dilution. The study was conducted from July to December 1994. The study was approved by the Hospital's Medical Ethics Committee, and informed con.sent was obtained from all participants. The subjects\" characteristics are listed in Table I . The study had a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. Prior to tbe study, each subject was screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three days before the experimental inoculation o\\ virus or placebo, a histamine inhalation test was carried out. Subsequently, virus or placebo (diluent) was administered on two successive days. Histamine challenges were repeated at days 4 and 11 after the first inoculation of virus or placebo. Nasal washing was performed and a blood sample was taken immediately before the first inoculation of virus or placebo, and then at days 2 and 9. Four weeks after inoculation all subjects returned to the laborator>' for a final nasal washing and a blood sample to determine the convalescent antibody titre. Tbe RVl6 virus strain and stock was the same as used in previous experiments in humans in vivo by others |IOI and K. Griinherg et ai. by ourselves [I5[. The virus was cultured according to standards of good laboratory practice and the int)culum was tested to be safe for human m vivo usage 125|. Nasal inoculation of ihe rhino\\ims was performed foIUiuing a previously described method j l()[, that was slightly modified by adding nasal virus inhalation [ I5|. A total dose of 0.5-2.9xin^ TClDs,, diluted in 3ml Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) with O.y/c (w/v) gelatin was administered to each subject. This dose was divided over 2 days. On each day the same procedure for virus inoculation was followed. First, 0.5 ml of the inoculum was inhaled through the nose by using a nebuli/.er (DeVilbiss 646: median mass aerosol diameter (MMAD) 2.4/xm) connected to a lace mask. .Second. 0.5ml was sprayed by atomizer (DeVilbiss 286. powered by a compressor. MMAD: > IO^m)intothe nostrils. And finally, 0.5 ml was instilled into the nostrils by pipette. We considered a four-fold or greater increase in virusspecific neutralizing antibody in the serum and/or recovery of the virus from nasal washes as confinnatitm ^^\\ RV16 infection [ 1(M5|. Before and 28 days after virus or placebo inoculation, levels of neutralizing antibodies were determined by a neutralization assay using homologous virus [ 10.I5J. Nasal Unages were obtained before the first virus or placebo administration, and subsequently on days 2. 9 and 28. Human embryonic lung fibroblast (HEL) cultures were inoculated with these lavages and incubated at 32\"C for 14 days. If the culture showed the characteristic rhinovirusinduced cytopathic effects. RVl6 was identified by a neutralization assay, using RVl6 specific guinea pig immune serum (1126AS/GP-VR: Atnerican Type Culture Collection. Rdckville. MD). All na.sal washes were also inoculated into rhesus monkey kidney <LLC-MK2) cells, HEp-2 cell cultures and HEL cells, and cultured at 37°C. in order to exclude any intercurrent respiratory virus infection. Throughout the study period, symptoms of common cold and asthma were evaluated with a questionnaire tbat was completed by the participants three times daily. Cold symptoms included sneezing, sore throat, nasal discharge, stuffy nose, headache, cough, malaise, chills or fever, which were graded: 0 -absent. 1 = mild. 2 -moderate, 3 = severe and added up to a total cold symptom score. In subjects in whom infection was confirmed, those who recorded a total cold symptom score ^ 11 at any time-point after inoculation were defined as having a severe cold, whereas subjects with scores < 11 were considered to have a mild cold 110. 15.25] . In the same manner, asthma symptoms including cough, breathlessness. wheeze, chest tightness, and nocturnal symptoms were recorded |15]. The daily consumption of inhaled salbutamol as rescue medication was also noted. Standardized histamine challenge tests |26I were performed using histamine-di-phosphate in phosphate buffered saline. Histamine was stored at 4^C. and nebulized at room temperature in serial doubling concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 8mg/ml. A DeVilbiss 646 nebuli/er (DeVilbiss Co., Somerset, PA) (output 0.13 ml/min) was used, in connection tt) the central chamber of an in-and expiratory valve box with an expiratory aerosol filter (Pall Ultipor BB50T). The aerosol was inhaled by tidal breathing for 2min at 5min intervals witb the nose clipped. The lung function respK)n,se was measured as FEV|. obtained by a dry rolling spiromcter (Morgan spiroflow. Rainham, United Kingdom). First, baseline FEV I was determined as the mean of three reproducible values (within 5*^). Subsequently, single measurements of FEV| were made 90s after each histamine dose. The tests were discontinued if FEV, decreased by more than 20% from baseline. Afterwards the subjects inhaled 2(K)^g salbutamol to provide immediate bronchodilalion. A nuKlified \"nasal pool device\" was used for nasal lavage |27[. This consists of a syringe, connected to a rubber tube, equipped with an inflatable balloon, serving as a nasal adapter. The balkxin was inserted into the vestibulum nasi. and gently inflated. While the patient was sitting in a writing position, 10 ml of pre-warmed Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (one nostril with and the other without 0,5% gelatin) was instilled by gently compressing the syringe. After 5niin the fluid was recovered by retracting the syringe. This procedure was carried out in each nostril. The lavage recovered from the first (with 0.5'' ' f gelatin) and second nostril (without gelatin) was used for confirmation of RV infection and to determine the IL-8 level, respectively. Immediately after recover\\', nasal washings were centrifugcd at 250 x^' for lOmin. Supernatant was removed and stored at -1Q>^C until further analysis. The IL-8 levels were determined by ELISA (CLB. Amsterdam. The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's direction,*!. The detection limit of this assay was 40pg/mi. Before, and on days 2 and 9 iifter placebo or virus administration, absolute and differential leucocyte counts were assessed by automated blood count analysis (Technicon HI, Technicon, Tarrytown, NY). The highest individual total cold symptom score (referred to as cold score), and the cumulative asthma score recorded from day 0 to 5 after inoculation minus the cumulative scores from 4 days to I day before inoculation (referred to as asthma score) were used for correlation testing [15] . The response of FEV| to histamine was expressed as percentage fall from baseline value |26|, and was plotted against log nebulized concentration of histamine in mg/ml. The concentration-response curves were characterized by their position, expressed as the provocative concentration causing 20% fall in FEVi from baseline value (PCao), which was calculated by log-linear interpolation between the last two adjacent data-points |26]. The logarithm of PC20 was used in the analysis, and changes in PC20 were expressed in doubling doses (DD). IL-8 levels were expressed in ng/ml. peripheral blood leucocyte numbers were expressed in cells/L. Changes in the variables were analysed by repeatedmeasure analysis of variance (MANOVA). with placebo. RV16 treatment or severe cold and mitd eold a.s betweengroup factors and time as a within-group factor. Significant MANOVA effects were explored with Student's /-tests. Differences in PC2(i. IL-f^ levels and leucocyte numbers within the groups between the study days were examined using two-tailed paired r-tests, and differences between the groups were analysed using unpaired /-tests, The summary statistics were expressed as means ± SEM. For evaluation of associations between the variables. Ihe Pearson's correlation test was used. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. One of the RVl 6-treated subjects (subject 9) dropped out of the study at 7 days after the first inoculation because of a moderate exacerbation of asthma, requiring treatment with oral prednisone, to which she responded well. One nasal washing sample was excluded from the analysis (subject 7, day 9), because of a recent nose bleed. In the plaeebo group all cultures of nasal washes remained negative for RVl6 during each visit. In the virus-treated group RV 16 could not be detected in the nasal lavage before inoculation, whilst at day 2 RVl6 was detected in the nasal lavage of all but one subject (subject 18). At day 9, RVl6 was identified in 10 out of 19 subjects, whereas at day 28 all nasal washings were negative. No other respiratory viruses were identified in any of the nasal washings (Table I) . In the placebo group none of the subjects showed an increase in RV16 neutralizing antibodies. In the RV16 group all subjects but two (subjects 16 and 24) showed at least a four-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera (range: 4-fold to 128-fold increase) ( Table 1) . In the placebo group, there was no significant change in cold score or asthma score (MANOVA, P > 0.52). In the RVl6 group, there was a significant increase in cold score (MANOVA. P<0.00\\). that peaked I day after the first inoculation, gradually returning to baseline within 5 days. The highest cold scores were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.001). Eight of the RVI6-infected subjects had a severe cold as shown by a symptom score > 11 ( Table   1 ). In the RVl 6-treated subjects there was a significant increase in asthma symptoms {MANOVA, P < 0.001) that peaked on the second and third day after the first inoculation, and returned to baseline within 5 days. The asthma score in the subjects with a severe cold was significantly higher than the asthma score in those with a mild cold and the placebo-treated subjects (/»< 0.001) ( Table 1) . Cold score and asthma score were significantly correlated in the RVI6 group (r^O.92. /'< 0.001). The use of salbutamol did not change significantly within the groups at any time point (MANOVA, P = 1.00). Before RV 16 or placebo inoculation, FEV i % predicted was slightly higher in the RVl6 group as compared to the placebo group (P = 0.04) ( Table 1 ). During the course of the study, there were no significant effects on baseline FEV| within either the placebo group or in the RVl 6-treated subjects with a mild or severe cold (MANOVA, P -0.99) ( Figure 1 ). The maximal change in FEV, after infection did not correlate significantly with the asthma score (P = 0.98). Before inoculation of RVl6 or placebo, the mean PC20 was not different between the two treatment groups (P ^ 0.93). In the placebo group, there was no significant change in PC20 during the study (MANOVA, P = 0.67) (Figure 2 ). In the RVl6 group, there was a significant decrease in PC20 at day 4 (mean difference ± SEM: -0.65 ± 0.25 DD, P = 0.02), which was no longer significant at day 11 (mean difference ± SEM: -0.40 ± 0.30 DD, P = 0.19). These changes were not significantly different from placebo (P = 0.10 and P = 0.27, respectively). However, in the subjects with a severe cold, this decrease was more pronounced: mean difference ± SEM: -1.14 ± 0.28 DD, P -0.005 at day 4. with a trend towards a decrease at day II (mean difference ± SEM: -0.75 ± 0.34DD. P = 0.07) {Figure 2). This change was significantly different from placebo at day four, but not at day \\i (P = O.OI and P = 0.09. respectively). In the tnild cold group there was neither a change in PC2(, at day 4 (mean difference ± SEM: -0.30 ± 0.35 DD. P = 0.42). nor at day II (mean difference ± SEM: -0.18 ± 0.44 DD, P = 0.68) (Figure 2) . The changes in PC20 in the five subjects with pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against RV16 were not statistically different from the changes in those without such antibodies {MANOVA. P ^ 0.33) {day 4: mean change ± SEM: -0.53 ± 0.46 DD. P = 0.31. and -0.69 ± 0.31 DD. F = 0.04. respectively. Day 11: -1.10 ±0.28DD. P = 0.02. and -0.13 ± 0.38 DD. P = 0.73, respectively). IL-8 in the nasal washings did not change significantly in the placebo group (MANOVA. P = 0.06) {Figure 3). In the RVl6 group, IL-8 increased both at days 2 and 9 {P<O.OOI) as compared to day -5. In subjects with a severe cold this increase was significant at both time-points {within group. P < 0.04), and also as compared to placebo {P<0.05). In those with a mild cold the increase in IL-8 was only significant at day 9, both within the group {P = 0.008) and compared to placebo (P<0.01) {Figure 3). The increase in IL-8 at day 2 in the RV16 group correlated significantly with the cold score {r ^ 0.80. P< 0.001). a.sthma score (r = 0.68. P^ 0.001), and with the change in PC2() at day 4 (r = -0.48, P = 0.04) (Figure 4a, 4b) . In the RVl6 treated subjects differential leucocyte counts showed a significant rise in the number of neutrophils {P<O.OOl) and a concomitant decrease in lymphocyte number at day 2 after inoculation {P< 0.001) ( Figure 5 ). Only in subjects with a severe cold were the cell numbers at day 2 significantly different from placebo {P^O.Ol). Neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers had returned to baseline at day 9 {P > 0.17). The number of neutrophils at day 2 correlated significantly with cold score (r = 0.59. P = 0.008). asthma score {r^O.65, P = 0.002), the change in PC2,) at day 4 (r --0.49, P = 0.03), whilst there was a trend towards a significant correlation with the change in IL-8 levels at day 2 (r-0.39. P-O.IO) (Figure 4c) . Furthermore, the number of lymphocytes at day 2 was also significantly related to the cold scores histamine. particularly in those patients who develop a severe cold. In addition, we have demonstrated that the levels of the pro-infiammatory chemokine IL-8 in nasal secretions rise after infection. This rise is ass(x:iated with cold score, change in airway hyperresponsiveness. and numbers of neutrophils and lymphwytes in peripheral bltHxi after infection. These findings suggest that the severity of the cold is a major determinant of rhinovirus-indiiced airway hypenesponsiveness in asthma. Our results fit in with the hypeithesis that this is mediated through an inflammatory mechanism inviil\\ing locally produced chemokines. This is the first placebo-controlled study showing the development of airway hypersensitivity to histamine after experimental infection with wild type rhinovirus. The change in airway hypersensitivity in the asthmatic subjects with severe colds was about 1 doubling dose, which is similar to what is usually observed after allergen challenge |28|. Rhinovinis-induced hypersensitivity of such magnitude has also been demonstrated in patients with atopic rhinitis by Lemanske et ai |l()|. However, in the latter subjects the histamine hypersensitivity lasted up lo 4 weeks after infection, whereas in our study the effect was no longer significant at day 11. One could speculate that the prolonged effect in atopic rhinitis may have been due to the additional allergen challenges during that study. Two previous studies on experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma [!3.14| showed small and variable changes in airway hypersensitivity. Our findings suggest that this might be explained by the severity of the colds that were induced. After taking this into account, it appears that experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma does lead to substantial worsening of PCio to histamine. Interestingly, this also occurred in the small number of subjects who had preexisting RVl6 neutralizing, but possibly cross-reactive circulating antibodies. The latter may not be surprising, since atopic .subjects with low titres of neutralizing antibodies, as opposed to normal subjects with such titres, have been shown to develop severe cold symptoms after experimental RV16 inoculation [29] . The design of the present study allowed us to differentiate the responses to rhinovirus inoculation from normal fluctuations in symptoms and airway physiology that are characteristic to asthma. The study was performed in the months July to December, but no attempt was made to exclude coinciding allergen exposure (pollen, house dust mite), since this would have been hard to accomplish. However, the present circumstances can be considered as those encountered during naturally occurring infections. Despite the fact that the subjects were clinically stable as assessed by history, and by symptom control with p.r.n. /ST adrenergic medication alone, a moderate exacerbation of asthma developed in the subject who had the lowest PC^o at entry into the study. This underlines the potential of exacerbations after rhinovirus infection in patients with asthma (3.9,301, despite the usually small accompanying changes in lung function [13] [14] [15] . In this study, we applied validated procedures for inoculation and measuring the responses to rhinovirus infection. First, by using a combination of three methods of virus admini.stration, including nasal inhalation, the natural ways of transmission were mimicked [31] . In this way, the virus may even have reached the intrapulmonary airways [32] . Second, commonly used and well-standardized methods for lung function testing and histamine challenges were used [26] . Third, we applied a validated method for nasal lavage [27] , which allowed lL-8 to diffuse into the lavage fluid during a 5-min exposure period of the nasal epithelium, resulting in IL-8 levels well above the detection limit of the IL-8 ELISA. How can the present results be interpreted? The increase in airway hypersensitivity, in the absence of a significant decrease in lung function, during the acute phase of infection might be explained by physiological phenomena such as airway wall swelling, potentiating the airway narrowing effect of smooth muscle shortening [33] . Such an explanation would be in keeping with the observations by Cheung et al. [15] , who showed that experimental RV16 infection leads to excessive airway narrowing in response to inhaled methacholine in subjects with asthma. Airway wall swelling in asthma is generally considered to be a consequence of inflammation [2] . Indeed, Fraenkel et al. [14] recently described the infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly lymphocytes and eosinophils into the bronchial mucosa in patients with asthma after experimental RVI6 infection. The presently observed correlation between the numbers of © 1997 Blackwell Science Lid, Clinical and Experimental Allergy. 11, 36-45 neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood after infeetion and the change in airway hypersensitivity indirectly supports an active role of these cells in the virus-induced airway inllammation. We found a marked rise in lL-8 in nasal secretions after RVl6 infection. In general, this confirms the ability of rhinovirus to increase the release of a number of proinflammatory mediators and/or cytokines within the airways, such as kinins [16, 34] and interleukin-1 [35] in nasal secretions, and histamine in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid [36] . The present results obtained by experimental rhinovirus infection are in keeping with the preliminary data of Teran et al. [22] , who showed that levels of IL-8 in nasal secretions were elevated in nasal secretions during a naturally acquired cold in children with asthma. Our results extend these previous observations by showing an association between the increase in IL-8 in nasal washings and cold or asthma symptoms, as well as the degree of worsening of airway hyperrespon.sivene.ss. IL-8 is a CXC-chemokine, produced by tissue cells {epithelial ceils, fibroblast and endothelial cells), leucocytes, macrophages and mast cells [24, 37] and displays various activities, such as chemotactic activity for neutrophils, lymphocytes and basophils [38] . In addition, IL-8 may be involved in the recruitment of primed eosinophils, implicating its involvement in allergic inflammation |39]. Since rhinovirus in vitro induces the production of IL-8 in epithelium, fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 120,21,40], our findings support the hypothesis that the release of mediators, such as the chemokine IL-8, can drive the airway inflammation, and thereby the hypersensitivity to histamine after rhinovirus infection in allergic asthma. What are the clinical implications of this study? First, a common cold aggravates airway hypersensitivity in patients with asthma, fitting in with the close epidemiological association between rhinovirus infections and exacerbations of asthma [5, 9] . And .second, it appears that atopie asthmatic patients with low titres of neutralizing antibodies may not be fully protected against experimental RVI6 infection, and its detrimental effects on their asthma. This ohservation in a small number of subjects in the present study first needs confirmation in larger series of experimental or naturally occurring rhinovirus infections in patients with allergic asthma. In conclusion, experimental RV16 infection can be employed as a useful laboratory model for the development of airway hypersensitivity during an asthma exacerbation. One of the potential mechanisms for this might be the rhinovirus-induced release of pro-inflammatory chemokines. This hypothesis needs further testing in models of rhinovirus infection in vitro and in vivo, focusing on the pathological mechanisms in the intrapulmonary airways in patients with asthma.",
         "Effect of experimental rhinovirus 16 colds on airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine and interleukin‐8 in nasal lavage in asthmatic subjects in vivo. Background Asthma exacerbations are closely associated with respiratory virus infections. However, the pathophysiological consequences of such infections in asthma are largely unclear. Objective To examine the effect of rhinovirus 16 (RV16) infection on airway hypersensitivity to histamine. and on interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) in nasal lavage. Objective Twenty‐seven non‐smoking atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects participated in a placebo‐controlled, parallel study. A dose of 0.5–2.9 ± 10(4) TCID50 RV16 or placebo was nasally administered. Cold symptoms were recorded by questionnaire throughout the study. Histamine challenges were performed at entry, and on days 4 and 11 after inoculation. Nasal lavages were obtained at entry, and on days 2 and 9. The response to histamine was measured by PC(20) (changes expressed as doubling doses: DD). IL‐8 levels were obtained by ELISA, and were expressed in ng/ml. Results RV infection was confirmed by culture of nasal lavage and/or by antibody titre rise in each of the RV16‐treated subjects. Among the 19 RV16‐treated subjects, eight developed severe cold symptoms. Baseline FEV(1) did not change significantly during the study in either treatment group (P= 0.99). However, in the RV16‐treated subjects there was a decrease in PC(20) at day 4, which was most pronounced in those with a severe cold (mean change ± SEM: –1.14 ± 0.28 DD, P= 0.01). In addition. IL‐8 levels increased in tbe RV16 group at days 2 and 9 (P < 0.001). The increase in nasal IL‐8 at day 2 correlated significantly with the change in PC(20) at day 4 (r=–0.48, P= 0.04). Conclusion We conclude that the severity of cold, as induced by experimental RV16 infection, is a determinant of the increase in airway hypersensitivity to histamine in patients with asthma. Our results suggest that this may be mediated by an infiammatory mechanism, involving the release of chemokines such as IL‐8.. virus infections and/or to airborne allergens, potentially leading lo a flare-up of airway inliammation II.2|. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have described a close lemporal as.^ociation of respiratory virus infections with asthma exacerbations [3|. Respiratory viruses can be identified in 10 to 44% of the asthma exacerbations in adults |4.5|. whilst in children identification rates vary from 26 to 83'/f [6] [7] [8] [9] . The use of sen.sitive techniques to detect rhinovirus and coronavirus in the two most recent studies have resulted in the highest identification rates so far [5. 9|. Among the various respiratory viruses identilied, rhinovirus predominates in most of these studies 15.7-91. Interestingly, rbinovirus shedding in the absence of cold symptoms does not seem to be associated with clinical worsening of asthma [7] . The effects of experimental rhinovirus infection on airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine are somewhat controversial. Lemanske et al. demonstrated an induction of hypersensitivity to histamine after experimental rbinovirus 16 (RVI6) infection in non-asthmatic patients with atopic rhinitis [lO] . whereas others have not observed such an effect when using other rhinovirus scrotypes [11.12] . In asthmatic subjects. Halperin et al. found increased hypersensitivity to histamine in only four out of 22 subjects after experimental rhinovirus (serotype 39 and HH strain) infection 113|. whilst in the most recent study by Fraenke! et al. a rather small, but significant increase in sensitivity to histamine could be detected in six asthmatic subjects after infection with RVI6 [ 14|. Since none of these studies was placebo-controlled, it seems mandatory to examine the effect of experimental rhinovirus infection on airway sensitivity to histamine in asthmatic subjects by using such a design. This has successfully been employed in our previous study, showing excessive airway narrowing to methacholine after RVl6 infection in atopic asthmatic subjects | LS]. Rhinovirus infection has been shown to lead to infiltration of inflammator>' cells into nasal secretions and mucosa fl6-18| as well us into the bronchia! mucusa |I4] in normal and/or atopic subjects. In vitro, there is evidence that bronchial epithelial cell lines, fibroblasts and mononuclear cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection with rhinovirus 119-211. In vivo, the levels of chemokines such as interleukin-8. RANTES and MIP-lo; were found to be elevated in nasal secretions of asthmatic children during naturally acquired colds [22.23] . Consequently, one can postulate that chemokines such as IL-8 drive recruitment of inflammatory cells |24!. thus promoting airway inflammation, and thereby airway sensitivity to histamine. In the present study, we hypothesized that experimental RVI6 colds in atopic asthmatic patients increase airway sensitivity to histamine. particularly in those with severe cold symptoms. In addition, we postulated that this effect is associated with a rise of IL-8 in nasal secretion. To tbat end. we measured dose-response curves to inhaled histamine and levels of IL-8 in nusul washings before and after placebocontrolled nasal inhalation of wild type RV16 in atopic. mildly asthmatic patients. Twenty-seven non-smoking, atopic asthmatic subjects participated in this study. The subjects had not used inhaled or oral corticosteroids for at least 3 months, nor had they used theophyllines. antihistamines. sodium cromoglycate, or nedocromyl sodium for at least 6 weeks preceding the study. Symptoms of asthma were stable and controlled by on demand usage of inhaled salbutamol alone, that was withheld for at least 8 h before the measurements. There was no history of relevant exposure to allergens from 2 weeks before until the end of the study. The patients were not selected on basis of a history of virus-induced exacerbations. Among the eight subjects who received placebo-inocuiatit^n. four did not have neutralizing antibodies in their undiluted sent against 20-25 tissue culture infective dose (< 1:1). and four had titres between 1:2 and 1:128 serum dilution. Fourteen out of the 19 .subjects who received virus did not have neutralizing antibodies, and live had titres in the range of 1:2 to 1:16 serum dilution. The study was conducted from July to December 1994. The study was approved by the Hospital's Medical Ethics Committee, and informed con.sent was obtained from all participants. The subjects\" characteristics are listed in Table I . The study had a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. Prior to tbe study, each subject was screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three days before the experimental inoculation o\\ virus or placebo, a histamine inhalation test was carried out. Subsequently, virus or placebo (diluent) was administered on two successive days. Histamine challenges were repeated at days 4 and 11 after the first inoculation of virus or placebo. Nasal washing was performed and a blood sample was taken immediately before the first inoculation of virus or placebo, and then at days 2 and 9. Four weeks after inoculation all subjects returned to the laborator>' for a final nasal washing and a blood sample to determine the convalescent antibody titre. Tbe RVl6 virus strain and stock was the same as used in previous experiments in humans in vivo by others |IOI and K. Griinherg et ai. by ourselves [I5[. The virus was cultured according to standards of good laboratory practice and the int)culum was tested to be safe for human m vivo usage 125|. Nasal inoculation of ihe rhino\\ims was performed foIUiuing a previously described method j l()[, that was slightly modified by adding nasal virus inhalation [ I5|. A total dose of 0.5-2.9xin^ TClDs,, diluted in 3ml Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) with O.y/c (w/v) gelatin was administered to each subject. This dose was divided over 2 days. On each day the same procedure for virus inoculation was followed. First, 0.5 ml of the inoculum was inhaled through the nose by using a nebuli/.er (DeVilbiss 646: median mass aerosol diameter (MMAD) 2.4/xm) connected to a lace mask. .Second. 0.5ml was sprayed by atomizer (DeVilbiss 286. powered by a compressor. MMAD: > IO^m)intothe nostrils. And finally, 0.5 ml was instilled into the nostrils by pipette. We considered a four-fold or greater increase in virusspecific neutralizing antibody in the serum and/or recovery of the virus from nasal washes as confinnatitm ^^\\ RV16 infection [ 1(M5|. Before and 28 days after virus or placebo inoculation, levels of neutralizing antibodies were determined by a neutralization assay using homologous virus [ 10.I5J. Nasal Unages were obtained before the first virus or placebo administration, and subsequently on days 2. 9 and 28. Human embryonic lung fibroblast (HEL) cultures were inoculated with these lavages and incubated at 32\"C for 14 days. If the culture showed the characteristic rhinovirusinduced cytopathic effects. RVl6 was identified by a neutralization assay, using RVl6 specific guinea pig immune serum (1126AS/GP-VR: Atnerican Type Culture Collection. Rdckville. MD). All na.sal washes were also inoculated into rhesus monkey kidney <LLC-MK2) cells, HEp-2 cell cultures and HEL cells, and cultured at 37°C. in order to exclude any intercurrent respiratory virus infection. Throughout the study period, symptoms of common cold and asthma were evaluated with a questionnaire tbat was completed by the participants three times daily. Cold symptoms included sneezing, sore throat, nasal discharge, stuffy nose, headache, cough, malaise, chills or fever, which were graded: 0 -absent. 1 = mild. 2 -moderate, 3 = severe and added up to a total cold symptom score. In subjects in whom infection was confirmed, those who recorded a total cold symptom score ^ 11 at any time-point after inoculation were defined as having a severe cold, whereas subjects with scores < 11 were considered to have a mild cold 110. 15.25] . In the same manner, asthma symptoms including cough, breathlessness. wheeze, chest tightness, and nocturnal symptoms were recorded |15]. The daily consumption of inhaled salbutamol as rescue medication was also noted. Standardized histamine challenge tests |26I were performed using histamine-di-phosphate in phosphate buffered saline. Histamine was stored at 4^C. and nebulized at room temperature in serial doubling concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 8mg/ml. A DeVilbiss 646 nebuli/er (DeVilbiss Co., Somerset, PA) (output 0.13 ml/min) was used, in connection tt) the central chamber of an in-and expiratory valve box with an expiratory aerosol filter (Pall Ultipor BB50T). The aerosol was inhaled by tidal breathing for 2min at 5min intervals witb the nose clipped. The lung function respK)n,se was measured as FEV|. obtained by a dry rolling spiromcter (Morgan spiroflow. Rainham, United Kingdom). First, baseline FEV I was determined as the mean of three reproducible values (within 5*^). Subsequently, single measurements of FEV| were made 90s after each histamine dose. The tests were discontinued if FEV, decreased by more than 20% from baseline. Afterwards the subjects inhaled 2(K)^g salbutamol to provide immediate bronchodilalion. A nuKlified \"nasal pool device\" was used for nasal lavage |27[. This consists of a syringe, connected to a rubber tube, equipped with an inflatable balloon, serving as a nasal adapter. The balkxin was inserted into the vestibulum nasi. and gently inflated. While the patient was sitting in a writing position, 10 ml of pre-warmed Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (one nostril with and the other without 0,5% gelatin) was instilled by gently compressing the syringe. After 5niin the fluid was recovered by retracting the syringe. This procedure was carried out in each nostril. The lavage recovered from the first (with 0.5'' ' f gelatin) and second nostril (without gelatin) was used for confirmation of RV infection and to determine the IL-8 level, respectively. Immediately after recover\\', nasal washings were centrifugcd at 250 x^' for lOmin. Supernatant was removed and stored at -1Q>^C until further analysis. The IL-8 levels were determined by ELISA (CLB. Amsterdam. The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's direction,*!. The detection limit of this assay was 40pg/mi. Before, and on days 2 and 9 iifter placebo or virus administration, absolute and differential leucocyte counts were assessed by automated blood count analysis (Technicon HI, Technicon, Tarrytown, NY). The highest individual total cold symptom score (referred to as cold score), and the cumulative asthma score recorded from day 0 to 5 after inoculation minus the cumulative scores from 4 days to I day before inoculation (referred to as asthma score) were used for correlation testing [15] . The response of FEV| to histamine was expressed as percentage fall from baseline value |26|, and was plotted against log nebulized concentration of histamine in mg/ml. The concentration-response curves were characterized by their position, expressed as the provocative concentration causing 20% fall in FEVi from baseline value (PCao), which was calculated by log-linear interpolation between the last two adjacent data-points |26]. The logarithm of PC20 was used in the analysis, and changes in PC20 were expressed in doubling doses (DD). IL-8 levels were expressed in ng/ml. peripheral blood leucocyte numbers were expressed in cells/L. Changes in the variables were analysed by repeatedmeasure analysis of variance (MANOVA). with placebo. RV16 treatment or severe cold and mitd eold a.s betweengroup factors and time as a within-group factor. Significant MANOVA effects were explored with Student's /-tests. Differences in PC2(i. IL-f^ levels and leucocyte numbers within the groups between the study days were examined using two-tailed paired r-tests, and differences between the groups were analysed using unpaired /-tests, The summary statistics were expressed as means ± SEM. For evaluation of associations between the variables. Ihe Pearson's correlation test was used. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. One of the RVl 6-treated subjects (subject 9) dropped out of the study at 7 days after the first inoculation because of a moderate exacerbation of asthma, requiring treatment with oral prednisone, to which she responded well. One nasal washing sample was excluded from the analysis (subject 7, day 9), because of a recent nose bleed. In the plaeebo group all cultures of nasal washes remained negative for RVl6 during each visit. In the virus-treated group RV 16 could not be detected in the nasal lavage before inoculation, whilst at day 2 RVl6 was detected in the nasal lavage of all but one subject (subject 18). At day 9, RVl6 was identified in 10 out of 19 subjects, whereas at day 28 all nasal washings were negative. No other respiratory viruses were identified in any of the nasal washings (Table I) . In the placebo group none of the subjects showed an increase in RV16 neutralizing antibodies. In the RV16 group all subjects but two (subjects 16 and 24) showed at least a four-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera (range: 4-fold to 128-fold increase) ( Table 1) . In the placebo group, there was no significant change in cold score or asthma score (MANOVA, P > 0.52). In the RVl6 group, there was a significant increase in cold score (MANOVA. P<0.00\\). that peaked I day after the first inoculation, gradually returning to baseline within 5 days. The highest cold scores were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.001). Eight of the RVI6-infected subjects had a severe cold as shown by a symptom score > 11 ( Table   1 ). In the RVl 6-treated subjects there was a significant increase in asthma symptoms {MANOVA, P < 0.001) that peaked on the second and third day after the first inoculation, and returned to baseline within 5 days. The asthma score in the subjects with a severe cold was significantly higher than the asthma score in those with a mild cold and the placebo-treated subjects (/»< 0.001) ( Table 1) . Cold score and asthma score were significantly correlated in the RVI6 group (r^O.92. /'< 0.001). The use of salbutamol did not change significantly within the groups at any time point (MANOVA, P = 1.00). Before RV 16 or placebo inoculation, FEV i % predicted was slightly higher in the RVl6 group as compared to the placebo group (P = 0.04) ( Table 1 ). During the course of the study, there were no significant effects on baseline FEV| within either the placebo group or in the RVl 6-treated subjects with a mild or severe cold (MANOVA, P -0.99) ( Figure 1 ). The maximal change in FEV, after infection did not correlate significantly with the asthma score (P = 0.98). Before inoculation of RVl6 or placebo, the mean PC20 was not different between the two treatment groups (P ^ 0.93). In the placebo group, there was no significant change in PC20 during the study (MANOVA, P = 0.67) (Figure 2 ). In the RVl6 group, there was a significant decrease in PC20 at day 4 (mean difference ± SEM: -0.65 ± 0.25 DD, P = 0.02), which was no longer significant at day 11 (mean difference ± SEM: -0.40 ± 0.30 DD, P = 0.19). These changes were not significantly different from placebo (P = 0.10 and P = 0.27, respectively). However, in the subjects with a severe cold, this decrease was more pronounced: mean difference ± SEM: -1.14 ± 0.28 DD, P -0.005 at day 4. with a trend towards a decrease at day II (mean difference ± SEM: -0.75 ± 0.34DD. P = 0.07) {Figure 2). This change was significantly different from placebo at day four, but not at day \\i (P = O.OI and P = 0.09. respectively). In the tnild cold group there was neither a change in PC2(, at day 4 (mean difference ± SEM: -0.30 ± 0.35 DD. P = 0.42). nor at day II (mean difference ± SEM: -0.18 ± 0.44 DD, P = 0.68) (Figure 2) . The changes in PC20 in the five subjects with pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against RV16 were not statistically different from the changes in those without such antibodies {MANOVA. P ^ 0.33) {day 4: mean change ± SEM: -0.53 ± 0.46 DD. P = 0.31. and -0.69 ± 0.31 DD. F = 0.04. respectively. Day 11: -1.10 ±0.28DD. P = 0.02. and -0.13 ± 0.38 DD. P = 0.73, respectively). IL-8 in the nasal washings did not change significantly in the placebo group (MANOVA. P = 0.06) {Figure 3). In the RVl6 group, IL-8 increased both at days 2 and 9 {P<O.OOI) as compared to day -5. In subjects with a severe cold this increase was significant at both time-points {within group. P < 0.04), and also as compared to placebo {P<0.05). In those with a mild cold the increase in IL-8 was only significant at day 9, both within the group {P = 0.008) and compared to placebo (P<0.01) {Figure 3). The increase in IL-8 at day 2 in the RV16 group correlated significantly with the cold score {r ^ 0.80. P< 0.001). a.sthma score (r = 0.68. P^ 0.001), and with the change in PC2() at day 4 (r = -0.48, P = 0.04) (Figure 4a, 4b) . In the RVl6 treated subjects differential leucocyte counts showed a significant rise in the number of neutrophils {P<O.OOl) and a concomitant decrease in lymphocyte number at day 2 after inoculation {P< 0.001) ( Figure 5 ). Only in subjects with a severe cold were the cell numbers at day 2 significantly different from placebo {P^O.Ol). Neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers had returned to baseline at day 9 {P > 0.17). The number of neutrophils at day 2 correlated significantly with cold score (r = 0.59. P = 0.008). asthma score {r^O.65, P = 0.002), the change in PC2,) at day 4 (r --0.49, P = 0.03), whilst there was a trend towards a significant correlation with the change in IL-8 levels at day 2 (r-0.39. P-O.IO) (Figure 4c) . Furthermore, the number of lymphocytes at day 2 was also significantly related to the cold scores histamine. particularly in those patients who develop a severe cold. In addition, we have demonstrated that the levels of the pro-infiammatory chemokine IL-8 in nasal secretions rise after infection. This rise is ass(x:iated with cold score, change in airway hyperresponsiveness. and numbers of neutrophils and lymphwytes in peripheral bltHxi after infection. These findings suggest that the severity of the cold is a major determinant of rhinovirus-indiiced airway hypenesponsiveness in asthma. Our results fit in with the hypeithesis that this is mediated through an inflammatory mechanism inviil\\ing locally produced chemokines. This is the first placebo-controlled study showing the development of airway hypersensitivity to histamine after experimental infection with wild type rhinovirus. The change in airway hypersensitivity in the asthmatic subjects with severe colds was about 1 doubling dose, which is similar to what is usually observed after allergen challenge |28|. Rhinovinis-induced hypersensitivity of such magnitude has also been demonstrated in patients with atopic rhinitis by Lemanske et ai |l()|. However, in the latter subjects the histamine hypersensitivity lasted up lo 4 weeks after infection, whereas in our study the effect was no longer significant at day 11. One could speculate that the prolonged effect in atopic rhinitis may have been due to the additional allergen challenges during that study. Two previous studies on experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma [!3.14| showed small and variable changes in airway hypersensitivity. Our findings suggest that this might be explained by the severity of the colds that were induced. After taking this into account, it appears that experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma does lead to substantial worsening of PCio to histamine. Interestingly, this also occurred in the small number of subjects who had preexisting RVl6 neutralizing, but possibly cross-reactive circulating antibodies. The latter may not be surprising, since atopic .subjects with low titres of neutralizing antibodies, as opposed to normal subjects with such titres, have been shown to develop severe cold symptoms after experimental RV16 inoculation [29] . The design of the present study allowed us to differentiate the responses to rhinovirus inoculation from normal fluctuations in symptoms and airway physiology that are characteristic to asthma. The study was performed in the months July to December, but no attempt was made to exclude coinciding allergen exposure (pollen, house dust mite), since this would have been hard to accomplish. However, the present circumstances can be considered as those encountered during naturally occurring infections. Despite the fact that the subjects were clinically stable as assessed by history, and by symptom control with p.r.n. /ST adrenergic medication alone, a moderate exacerbation of asthma developed in the subject who had the lowest PC^o at entry into the study. This underlines the potential of exacerbations after rhinovirus infection in patients with asthma (3.9,301, despite the usually small accompanying changes in lung function [13] [14] [15] . In this study, we applied validated procedures for inoculation and measuring the responses to rhinovirus infection. First, by using a combination of three methods of virus admini.stration, including nasal inhalation, the natural ways of transmission were mimicked [31] . In this way, the virus may even have reached the intrapulmonary airways [32] . Second, commonly used and well-standardized methods for lung function testing and histamine challenges were used [26] . Third, we applied a validated method for nasal lavage [27] , which allowed lL-8 to diffuse into the lavage fluid during a 5-min exposure period of the nasal epithelium, resulting in IL-8 levels well above the detection limit of the IL-8 ELISA. How can the present results be interpreted? The increase in airway hypersensitivity, in the absence of a significant decrease in lung function, during the acute phase of infection might be explained by physiological phenomena such as airway wall swelling, potentiating the airway narrowing effect of smooth muscle shortening [33] . Such an explanation would be in keeping with the observations by Cheung et al. [15] , who showed that experimental RV16 infection leads to excessive airway narrowing in response to inhaled methacholine in subjects with asthma. Airway wall swelling in asthma is generally considered to be a consequence of inflammation [2] . Indeed, Fraenkel et al. [14] recently described the infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly lymphocytes and eosinophils into the bronchial mucosa in patients with asthma after experimental RVI6 infection. The presently observed correlation between the numbers of © 1997 Blackwell Science Lid, Clinical and Experimental Allergy. 11, 36-45 neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood after infeetion and the change in airway hypersensitivity indirectly supports an active role of these cells in the virus-induced airway inllammation. We found a marked rise in lL-8 in nasal secretions after RVl6 infection. In general, this confirms the ability of rhinovirus to increase the release of a number of proinflammatory mediators and/or cytokines within the airways, such as kinins [16, 34] and interleukin-1 [35] in nasal secretions, and histamine in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid [36] . The present results obtained by experimental rhinovirus infection are in keeping with the preliminary data of Teran et al. [22] , who showed that levels of IL-8 in nasal secretions were elevated in nasal secretions during a naturally acquired cold in children with asthma. Our results extend these previous observations by showing an association between the increase in IL-8 in nasal washings and cold or asthma symptoms, as well as the degree of worsening of airway hyperrespon.sivene.ss. IL-8 is a CXC-chemokine, produced by tissue cells {epithelial ceils, fibroblast and endothelial cells), leucocytes, macrophages and mast cells [24, 37] and displays various activities, such as chemotactic activity for neutrophils, lymphocytes and basophils [38] . In addition, IL-8 may be involved in the recruitment of primed eosinophils, implicating its involvement in allergic inflammation |39]. Since rhinovirus in vitro induces the production of IL-8 in epithelium, fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 120,21,40], our findings support the hypothesis that the release of mediators, such as the chemokine IL-8, can drive the airway inflammation, and thereby the hypersensitivity to histamine after rhinovirus infection in allergic asthma. What are the clinical implications of this study? First, a common cold aggravates airway hypersensitivity in patients with asthma, fitting in with the close epidemiological association between rhinovirus infections and exacerbations of asthma [5, 9] . And .second, it appears that atopie asthmatic patients with low titres of neutralizing antibodies may not be fully protected against experimental RVI6 infection, and its detrimental effects on their asthma. This ohservation in a small number of subjects in the present study first needs confirmation in larger series of experimental or naturally occurring rhinovirus infections in patients with allergic asthma. In conclusion, experimental RV16 infection can be employed as a useful laboratory model for the development of airway hypersensitivity during an asthma exacerbation. One of the potential mechanisms for this might be the rhinovirus-induced release of pro-inflammatory chemokines. This hypothesis needs further testing in models of rhinovirus infection in vitro and in vivo, focusing on the pathological mechanisms in the intrapulmonary airways in patients with asthma.",

         "Aim: The most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants is bronchiolitis. Up to now there is no agreement on the upper limit age of bronchiolitis. Our aim was to identify if there are clinical differences in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis between 0–6 months and 6–12 months of age. A secondary aim was to establish whether there was differences in terms of recurrent wheezing at 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and virological records of 824 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during 11 consecutive epidemic seasons. From each infant at admission to the hospital nasopharyngeal washing was collected, clinical severity was assessed and clinical data were extracted from a structured questionnaire. At 12–24–36 months after discharge, parents were interviewed seeking information on recurrent wheezing. Results: A total of 773 infants (Group1) were ≤6 months of age, while 51 were >6 months (Group 2). No differences between family history for atopy and passive smoking exposure were observed between the two groups. Respiratory syncyzial virus was detected more frequently in Group 1 and human bocavirus in Group 2. The clinical severity score (p = 0.011) and the use of intravenous fluids (p = 0.0001) were higher in Group 1 with respect to Group 2 infants. At 36 months follow-up 163/106 (39.4%) Group 1 and 9/9 Group 2 infants experienced recurrent wheezing (p = 0.149). Conclusion: We demonstrated that 0-6 months old infants bronchiolitis differs from > 6 months bronchiolitis.",

         "Bronchiolitis is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the major responsible factor of hospitalization under the age of one year, with the highest incidence occurring between December to March. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is major involved virus, but also other respiratory viruses are able to cause bronchiolitis (1) . Some infants that require hospital admission for bronchiolitis will present recurrent wheezing episodes later in life (2) . Up to now, there has not been an agreement on bronchiolitis definition concerning the upper age limit, which varies between 12 and 24 months (3, 4) . Growing evidences suggest that the upper age limit should be restricted to 6 months (5) . We retrospectively analyzed clinical differences between 0-6 months and 6-12 months old infants, among our cohort of 824 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis at the Pediatric Emergency Department, \"Sapienza\" University of Rome, during eleven epidemic seasons. Among our cohort of 824 full-term previously healthy infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during 11 consecutive epidemic seasons, 773 (93.8%) were 0-6 months of age and 51 (6.2%) were 6-12 months old. Bronchiolitis was defined as the first episode of acute lower airway infection, characterized by a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnoea, retraction, and diffuse crackles on auscultation. Exclusion criteria were prematurity and underlying chronic diseases, such as immunodeficiency, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, and pulmonary chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. In line with confidentiality requirements, the database was anonymized and the ethic committees approved the study after infants' parents have released their informed consent. Nasopharyngeal washing (NPW) was collected from each infant within 24 h. Samples were delivered within 1-2 h to the virology laboratory and vortexed with beads to dissolve mucus, if needed. RSV was detected using a panel of reverse transcription PCR or nested PCR assays, as reported (1) . At admission to the hospital, clinical severity was assessed using a score ranging from 0 to 8, as described (1) . Clinical data were extracted from a structured questionnaire and clinical medical records. At 12-24-36 months after discharge, parents were interviewed using a standardized telephone procedure with a structured questionnaire seeking information on recurrent wheezing (two or more physician verified episodes of wheezing / year for three consecutive years). A standard statistical package was used for comparisons between groups (SPSS version 21.0, Chicago, IL). χ2 test was used to compare frequency distributions obtained from the two groups. Statistical means, medians, standard deviations and interquartile range were computed as well as Mann-Whitney Utest was performed, in order to compare groups. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the odds ratio. A two-tailed p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 773 infants (Group1: median age: 2.0 months, range: 0.2-6.0 months; males: 54.1%) were ≤6 months of age, while 51 were >6 months (Group 2: median age: 7.4 months, range: 6.1-12.0 months; males: 47.1%). A family history of asthma (23.5 vs. 17.6%) and atopy (35.3 vs. 35.5%) was similar between the groups. Group 1 infants had slightly less frequently tobacco smoking exposure (p = 0.107) than Group 2. The hospitalization for bronchiolitis occurred over the period December-March in the 80.9% of Group 1 and 70.6% of Group 2 infants (p = 0.059). A virus was identified from the nasal washing of 49.9% Group 1 and 54.9% of Group 2 infants. Among virus positive infants, RSV was the most frequently detected virus (68.1 vs. 42.9%, p = 0.007), followed by human rhinovirus (hRV: 11.7 vs. 14.3%), Abbreviations: hBoV, human bocavirus; hMpV, human metapneumovirus; hRV, human Rhinovirus; NPW, Nasopharyngeal washing; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. Table 1) . At 36 months' followup 163/106 (39.4%) Group 1 (40.9% of RSV and 47.6% of hRV infants) and 9/9 (50.0%) Group 2 (0 RSV and 100% of hRV) infants experienced recurrent wheezing (p = 0.149). The bivariate logistic regression designed to investigate the possible confounding factors (sex, clinical severity score, days of hospitalization and exposure to passive smoking, RSV, hBoV, and IV fluid) showed that the 6-12 months group had an odds ratio of hBoV detected at the NPA of 12.84 (95% CI 3.60-45.80) and the need of IV fluid of 0.45 (95% CI 0.20-0.99). This study analyzed the clinical differences among infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis divided according to the age: ≤ 6 months and > 6 months. Younger infants had more frequently RSV infection and a more severe disease. On the contrary, older infants had slightly more tobacco smoking exposure and slightly higher recurrent wheezing after the hospitalization. The hBoV has been identified almost entirely in infants older than 6 months. A distinct characteristic of our cohort is the adherence to strict inclusion criteria in bronchiolitis diagnosis, such as age <1 year, infants at the first episode of lower respiratory infection and the presence of crackles. This large series of bronchiolitis infants collected during 11 consecutive epidemic seasons allows an accurate evaluation of the age limit. The definition of bronchiolitis as the first episode of acute viral wheeze occurring in infants less than two years, likely overlaps the early presentation of asthma or bronchial hyper-responsiveness (5) . Moreover, bronchiolitis is a frequent and costly disease with mainly supportive treatment. Many studies have been made with the aim of finding other therapies, with controversial results (6) . A single definition of bronchiolitis will allow analyzing homogeneously disease's pathogenesis and the possible role of new therapeutic strategies. Although it has been already demonstrated that clinical presentation of bronchiolitis can vary over different epidemic years (7, 8) , the inclusion of full term infants, without any comorbidities over 11 consecutive epidemic seasons in our study should ensure that this variability is overcome. According to our data, the two age groups differ for the etiology. In fact, RSV remains the most important etiological agent causing bronchiolitis (1), particularly in 0-6 months old infants, while hBoV was almost exclusively detected in older infants. Interestingly, hBoV is an emerging virus frequently identified in wheezing children (9) . Moreover, hMpV was detected only in younger children. Some authors indicated that hMPV may cause an illness similar to RSV and follows the same epidemiology (10) . Older infants were slightly more frequently undergone to tobacco smoking exposure. Secondhand tobacco smoke in children causes decreased lung function and increased airway responsiveness and consequently it may predispose infants to more severe infections (11) . Passive smoking might be considered as risk factors in this age group. We could conclude that, while bronchiolitis affects independently younger infants, in > 6 months' infants it causes hospitalization particularly when risk factors are present, such as tobacco smoking exposure. The finding of a more severe disease reflects the different characteristic of younger infants with bronchiolitis, who present with retractions, feeding difficulties, and diffuse crackles and, because of the age are predisposed to a more severe disease. In fact, the leading risk factor for severe bronchiolitis is the young age (12) . In addition, 0-6 months old infants had a longer hospital stay. It may be explained because of the more severe illness in this age group. The multivariate analysis showed that the need of IV fluid was higher in the group aged 0-6 months, reflecting a higher severity of presentation in this age group. According to our findings of a higher occurrence within the epidemic season and of the slightly higher frequency of recurrent wheezing at 36 months' follow-up, infants > 6 months seems represent a different group of patients hospitalized for bronchiolitis, who are more predisposed to childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis the described difference. In conclusion, we demonstrated that 0-6 months old infants' bronchiolitis differs from > 6 months' bronchiolitis. Consequently, we believe that is time to reach an agreement on the definition of bronchiolitis, as the first episode of acute lower airways infection, characterized by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnea, retraction, and diffuse crackles on auscultation in infants <12 months, or even 6 months of age. • Bronchiolitis is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the major responsible factor of hospitalization under the age of one year. • Respiratory syncytial virus is major involved virus in bronchiolitis • Infants younger than 6 months had more frequently respiratory syncytial virus infection and a more severe disease. • Infants older than 6 months had slightly more tobacco smoking exposure and slightly higher recurrent wheezing after the hospitalization. • The human bocavirus has been identified almost entirely in infants older than 6 months.
